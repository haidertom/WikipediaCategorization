'''Algal mat''' is one of many types of microbial mat formed on the [[water]] surface or on the surface of rocks. It is made out of blue-green [[cyanobacteria]] and sediments. It is formed by having alteration layers between the blue-green bacteria and sediments, creating dark-laminated layers. [[Stromatolites]] are prime examples of algal mat. Algal mats played an important role in the [[Great Oxidation Event]] on Earth some 2.3 billion years ago. Overpopulation of algal mat may be an ecological problem, when mats disrupt the other underwater marine life by blocking the [[sunlight]].

==Cyanobacteria forming algal mats==
[[Cyanobacteria]] found in sedimentary rocks shows that the [[bacteria]] started life on Earth during the Pre-Cambrian age. Fossilized cyanobacteria are commonly found in rocks that date back to [[Mesoproterozoic]].&lt;ref name=cbgoe&gt;BETTINA E. SCHIRRMEISTER, MURIEL GUGGER and PHILIP C. J. DONOGHUE (2015), CYANOBACTERIA AND THE GREAT OXIDATION EVENT: EVIDENCE FROM GENES AND FOSSILS, Palaeontology, Vol. 58, Part 5, 2015, pp. 769–785&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria are photoautotroph in nature; meaning they convert carbon dioxide and absorbed sunlight into food and energy via [[photosynthesis]]. They are also able to fix atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into the biologically-usable form (Paerl, Pinkney and Steppe, 2000). This gives them competitive advantage over other organisms that may be limited by the shortage of biologically available nitrogen. The cyanobacteria colonies contain two types of cells, the regular cells with [[chlorophyll]] carrying out the photosynthesis, and heterocysts which fix nitrogen. [[Heterocysts]] have thick walls and lack chlorophyll, both of which limits the exposure of heterocysts to oxygen which presence inhibits nitrogen fixation. For the same reason nitrogen fixation may be limited to night time when with the shutdown of photosynthesis in the photosynthetic cells, oxygen is no longer produced and therefore does not interfere with nitrogen fixation.&lt;ref name="cbgoe"/&gt;

==[[Stromatolites]]==
Stromatolites are alternating layers of cyanobacteria and sediments. The grain size of sediment portion of stromatolites is affected by the depositional environment. During the [[Proterozoic]], the stromatolite’s compositions were dominated by micrite and thinly laminated lime mud, with thickness no more than 100 microns.&lt;ref name=gtfc&gt;C. M. FRANTZ , V. A. PETRYSHYN , AND F. A. CORSETTI, (2015) Grain trapping by filamentous cyanobacterial and algalmats: implications for stromatolite microfabrics through time, Geobiology (2015), 13, 409–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern stromatolites are characterized by their thicker and irregular laminations due to coarser grain size. Stromatolites trap sediment particles when the particles come to a rest from wave agitation.&lt;ref name="gtfc"/&gt; Trapping is separate process where filaments of bacteria traps the particle, provided the angle of the filaments are still within the limits before the grain rolls off due to overcoming the friction of the film.&lt;ref name="gtfc"/&gt; The same authors found that the length of the filaments played an important role in deciding the grain size trapped. Many of these bacterial mats are found in extreme environments because of evolution of oxygen and competition. Paerl, Pinkney and Steppe (2000) commented that these bacterial mats were marked by geochemical areas, such as volcanism and tectonics. They favour harsh environments that are either nutrient-depleted or have high salinity levels.&lt;ref name=cbmc&gt;Hans W. Paerl, James L. Pinckney and Timothy F. Steppe (2000), Cyanobacterial-bacterial mat consortia: examining thefunctional unit of microbial survival and growth inextreme environments, Environmental Microbiology (2000) 2(1), 11-26&lt;/ref&gt; In another article, the authors mentioned the [[autotrophic]] lifestyle of the bacteria enabled them to thrive in variety of regions with harsh surroundings. Stromatolites can be found in places with ranging temperature such as in the marine, limnic and soil &lt;ref name="cbgoe"/&gt;

==The importance of algal mats in the past==
Algal mat mostly consist of filaments made of autotrophic bacterial and fine-grained particles. These bacterial are well known for the formation of stromatolites. Based on an article by Paerl, Pinkney and Steppe (2000), phototrophic bacteria such as cyanobacteria is an evolutionary organism responsible for increased oxygen level during the Proterozoic age. The event was known as The [[Great Oxidation Event]], which was the creation and blooming of complex [[eukaryotic]] life form, which was left behind by these cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name=emci&gt;Bettina E. Schirrmeister, Jurriaan M. de Vos, Alexandre Antonelli, and Homayoun C. Bagheri (2012), Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the GreatOxidation Event, DOI10.1073/pnas.1209927110&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved stromatolites are called stromatoliths. It can be easily recognized by its crystallized thinly laminated layers and its domed, columnar or conical shaped. However, the same cannot be said to stromatolites that were not crystallized. According to Frantz, Petryshyn, and Corsetti (2015), many of the stromatolites could not be preserved due to a process known as [[diagenesis]]. Diagenesis is a weathering process where newly deposited sediments lies on top of the old sedimentary bed, buried and compacted, lithified and uplifted to the surface as sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref name="gtfc"/&gt;

==Negative impacts of HABs==
Damages such as environmental, economic and health are increasing in frequency, duration and in remote regions. These are caused by [[harmful algal blooms]] (HAB), also known as [[red tide]] or green tide. HABs have been known to produce a wide range of toxins, with newer toxins discovered frequently, which makes the task of understanding these phenomena increasingly difficult. HAB can be found in water of high importance for economic and environment; with [[salinity]] ranging from low to high such as in rivers and lakes to reservoirs and oceans. Toxins seeped into water column where it can get into water supply and affecting humans and livestock. Toxins can have either direct or indirect effect towards an organism. Some marine life is susceptible to toxins caused by HABs while others are affected through accumulation of toxins over a period of time; such as filter-feeding shell¬fish and secondary consumers. It has been estimated that there are thousands of human poisoning cases annually in Asia from toxic water. Single HAB fish-kill events in Korea have been estimated to have cost from $1–100 million in lost fish, while in Japan such events have been estimated to have resulted in losses of fish worth more than $300 million.&lt;ref name=haba&gt;Patricia M. Glibert (2013), Harmful Algal Blooms in Asia: an insidious and escalating waterpollution phenomenon with effects on ecological and humanhealth, ASIA Network Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, some HABs are harmful to the [[ecosystem]] through their sheer [[biomass]] accumulation. Such biomass accumulation can lead to a multitude of negative consequences. For one, their accumulation can reduce the light penetration in the water column, thereby reducing habitat suitability for the growth of submersed grasses. Exceedingly high biomass can also cause fish gills to clog, leading to suffocation.40 High biomass blooms can also lead to the development of “dead zones.” 41 Dead zones are formed when the algae begin to die and their decomposition depletes the water of oxygen. Dead zones do not support (aerobic) aquatic life, and are responsible for losses of millions of dollars’ worth of fish annually.&lt;ref name="haba"/&gt;

==Potential applications of algal mats==
Third generation [[biofuel]]s feedstock is represented by micro- and macro- algae, which present further advantages over the previous two. (The first generation biofuels are made from edible feedstock like corn, soybean, sugarcane, and rapeseed. Second generation of biofuels from waste and dedicated lignocellulosic feedstock shave advantages over those of first generation.) This marine biomass shows the prospect of high yields requiring no use of arable land. Major advantages of algae are: no competition with food crops for arable land, high growth rates, and low fractions of lignin which reduces the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and compatibility with biorefinery approach implementation. It has been proven that macroalgae can reach 2–20 times the production potential of conventional terrestrial energy crops However, some disadvantages such as the presence of high water content, seasonal chemical composition and the occurrence of inhibitory phenomena during anaerobic digestion, make algal biofuels not yet economically feasible although they are more environmental friendly than fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=bpab&gt;Montingelli, ME; Tedesco, S; Olabi, A G. Biogas production from algal biomass: A review, Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Reviews43 (Mar 1, 2015): 961-972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Algal mat is one of microbial mat made out of blue-green cyanobacteria and sediments. Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs organisms and commonly found in rocks in fossilized form.&lt;ref name="cbgoe"/&gt; And they are responsible for The Great Oxidation Event which accumulated the oxygen levels during the Proterozoic time and allowed complex life form to thrive (Schirrmeister, Vos, Antonelli, and Bagheri, 2013). However, due to water pollution with nutrient, algal mat can grow rapidly and affect the ecosystem negatively, which is known as Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).&lt;ref name="haba"/&gt; In spite of that, with farther development in technology, it can be useful for efficient biofuel.&lt;ref name="bpab"/&gt;

[[File:S7300095.JPG|right|thumb|[[Stonehenge]] is one of the most famous [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] ancient monuments.]]
In British law, an '''ancient monument''' is an early [[history|historical]] structure or [[monument]] (e.g. an [[archaeological site]]) worthy of [[historic preservation|preservation]] and study due to [[Archaeology|archaeological]] or [[cultural heritage|heritage]] interest. The term differs from the American term "[[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]]" in that U.S. National Monuments are [[List of National Monuments of the United States|comparatively few in number]] and may include natural formations; British ancient monuments are by definition manmade.

Ancient monuments are defined by the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46/section/61 |title=Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979   |date=4 April 1979 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as
*(a) any [[scheduled monument]] (of which there are currently more than 20,000&lt;ref name="DCMS Scheduled Monuments"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121204113822/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-04 |title= Scheduled Monuments |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |date=March 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and 
*(b) any other monument which in the opinion of the Secretary of State is of public interest by reason of the historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching to it.

'''Biostasis''' is the ability of an [[organism]] to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called [[diapause]]. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html | title=Tardigrade Facts | author=Karen Lindahl and Susie Balser | date=2 October 1999 | publisher=Illinois Wesleyan University | access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostasis is also used as a synonym for the terms [[Cryopreservation|cryostasis]] or [[cryonics]]. Cryonics is a  medical procedure concept that is a well established trope in [[Suspended animation in fiction|Science Fiction]], that may at some point in the future become a possible option for individuals who are terminally ill. The patients would be frozen in what is known as cryonic suspension. The patients are frozen so that when technology advances both to enable them to be unfrozen and brought back to life but also for their illness to be treated, they can be re-animated and their disease can be cured or treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkle|first=R.C.|date=September 1992|title=The technical feasibility of cryonics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030698779290133W|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=39|pages=6–16|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}}

Biostasis is also synonymous for '''Viable but Nonculturable state'''. In the past when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. It should be noted that VBNC state differs from 'starvation survival state' (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as "starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light" (9). Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include "dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis". (9) Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In E.coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who where in the growth state.

It should be noted that is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. "They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in &lt;u&gt;Legionella Pneumophila&lt;/u&gt; and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &lt;u&gt;Acanthamoeba Castellani&lt;/u&gt;" (9)

'''Fugistasis''' or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (Viable but Nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as "when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture." (10). Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability ect.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current Research ==
On March 1, 2018, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]] in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to "slow life to save life."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-03-01|title=Slowing Biological Time to Extend the Golden Hour for Lifesaving Treatment|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a [[Webinar]] which, along with a [[Broad Agency Announcement]] (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/Biostasis%20Webinar_Full%20Deck_For%20Posting.pdf|title=Rapid Threat Assessment (RTA)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.darpa.mil|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible Approaches ===
In their [[Web conferencing|Webinar]], [[DARPA]] outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into [[diapause]] in [[tardigrade]]s and [[wood frog]]s which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the [[protein]] level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Protein Chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] structures. Under typical conditions, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] facilitate changes in shape ([[conformational change]]) of [[macromolecule]]s in response to changes in environmental factors like [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[voltage]]. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/the-apromiscuousa-protein|title=The 'Promiscuous' Protein|last=University|first=Massey|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible that finding a way to control [[conformational change]] in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intracellular Crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/how-intracellular-crowding-changes-everything/|title=How Intracellular Crowding Changes Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intracellular [[organelle]]s are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable [[Spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] control of biological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brangwynne|first=Clifford P.|last2=Tompa|first2=Peter|last3=Pappu|first3=Rohit V.|date=2015-11-03|title=Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3532|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|volume=11|issue=11|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nphys3532|issn=1745-2473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing these intracellular [[polymer]]s to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered Proteins ====
[[Tardigrade]]s are [[Micro-animal|microscopic animals]] that are able to enter a state of [[diapause]] and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including [[freezing]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has shown that [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boothby|first=Thomas C.|last2=Tapia|first2=Hugo|last3=Brozena|first3=Alexandra H.|last4=Piszkiewicz|first4=Samantha|last5=Smith|first5=Austin E.|last6=Giovannini|first6=Ilaria|last7=Rebecchi|first7=Lorena|last8=Pielak|first8=Gary J.|last9=Koshland|first9=Doug|date=2017|title=Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation|url=https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17)30133-8|journal=Molecular Cell|language=English|volume=65|issue=6|pages=975–984.e5|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018|issn=1097-2765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[peptide]] engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] to the biological systems of larger animal organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of [[tardigrade]]s under extreme biological stress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5913">'''"Chicken Fat"''' (also known as '''"The Youth Fitness Song"''') is a 1962 song written by [[Broadway Musicals|Broadway]] composer [[Meredith Willson]] (''[[The Music Man]]'', ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'') and performed by actor/singer [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  It was commissioned as part of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness]].&lt;ref name=Riis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riis|first1=Richard|title=Apple's "Chicken Fat" Ad Harks Back to a Political Era Long Gone|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/06/09/1305530/-Apple-s-Chicken-Fat-Ads-Hark-Back-to-a-Political-Era-Long-Gone|accessdate=19 June 2014|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Chicken Fat" was the theme song for President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s youth fitness program, and millions of 7-inch 33 RPM discs which were pressed for free by [[Capitol Records]] were heard in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[junior high school]] gymnasiums across the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=JFKPE&gt;{{cite web| title= The Federal Government Takes on Physical Fitness | publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum | url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Physical-Fitness.aspx?p=2 | page=2 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson contacted Fitness Council administrator [[Dick Snider]] with an offer to write a song to be used to promote exercise for children.  Willson's offer was accepted and he consulted with Physical Fitness Council director Ted Forbes to ensure that the song would be effective.&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt; The bouncy chorus ended with the words "Go, you chicken fat, go!"&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFKPE/&gt;

The song was originally recorded on a [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] soundstage in early 1962 at the same time as the  recordings for the film soundtrack of the Warner Bros. film [[The Music Man (1962 film)|''The Music Man'']], starring [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  Recorded on the same three-track 35MM magnetic film as the soundtrack recordings, it features Preston's vocal isolated on one track, with the Bernie Green  Orchestra isolated on the second track and a chorus of boys and girls isolated on the third track. However, the location of the original multi-track tapes is unknown. As a result, with only the full-track quarter-inch 15 IPS monophonic composite master being available from which Capitol mastered their records in 1962, no [[stereophonic]] version of the song is currently possible and it remains in monophonic sound on the CD re-issue.&lt;ref name=JFKPE/&gt;

Two versions of the song exist: a 2:12 minute, radio-friendly length, “Disc Jockey Version"; and a longer, 6:30 “School Version”, for use in educational institution [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFKPE /&gt; The latter included 11 floor exercises for school children designed by [[Bud Wilkinson]], the head coach of the [[University of Oklahoma]] football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/13/chicken_fat_song_apple_iphone_5s_commercial_uses_kennedy_era_exercise_anthem.html|title=The Strange 1960s Gym-Class Anthem in Apple's New iPhone Commercial|first=Ben|last=Yagoda|authorlink=Ben Yagoda|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson, Preston, and Forbes all donated their services to the project , while Capitol Records, which produced and distributed three million copies of the 33 1/3 RPM record, paid for the backup musicians, studio time, and production and distribution.&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt; The original Physical Fitness Council was promoted in 1962 and 1963 through a series of public service TV commercials featuring baseball great [[Stan Musial]], filmed at [[Roosevelt Elementary School (Tampa, Florida)|Roosevelt Elementary School]] in Tampa, Florida.  

In 2014, "Chicken Fat" was used in a TV commercial by [[Apple Inc.]] to promote its new [[iOS 8]] [[Health (Apple)|health]] application. The commercial shows people swimming, running, and checking their weight while connected to iPhone apps and accessories to a recording of "Chicken Fat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-wants-you-to-get-rid-of-chicken-fat-using-its-iphone/|title=Apple wants you to get rid of 'chicken fat' using its iPhone|first=Shara |last=Tibken|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781770/apple-iphone-ad-strength-fitness-with-wearables-and-apps|title=New Apple ad urges you to shed that 'chicken fat'|first=Rick|last=McCormick|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported to be a 2000 recording by [[Bernie Knee]], a jingle writer and part-time cantor, which was released by [[Kimbo Educational Music]],&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://detroitkidshow.com/chicken_fat.htm|title=Poultry in Motion|publisher=Detroit Kid Show|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he died in 1994.&lt;ref name=MTV&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernie Knee Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/bernie-knee/biography/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, it was reported that it was a new recording but that Apple would not name the singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Stuart|title=Q. and A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20415">[[Image:Gebel el-Arak knife mp3h8791.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]].  The reverse of the handle shows a [[Master of Animals]] motif: two confronted lions, flanking a central figure (note confronted dogs and other animals below)]]
'''Confronted animals''', or '''confronted-animal''' as an [[adjective]], where two animals face each other in a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] pose, is an ancient bilateral [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[art]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] studied in [[archaeology]] and [[art history]]. The "anti-confronted animals" is the opposing motif, with the animals back to back.

Bilateral symmetry is a dominant aspect of our world and strong representation of it with matching figures often creates a balance that is appealing in artwork.

In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often involve the [[Master of Animals]], a central human figure between two confronted animals, often grasping them, and are probably part of a unified [[sociology|socio-]][[culture|cultural]] motif. A related motif in ancient art is known as the [[Mistress of Animals]].

It is thought that the [[iconography]] sometimes has [[ritual]] and religious associations; for example, the Lion Gate of [[Mycenae]] has a column between the protective, surmounted and confronted lionesses standing with two feet on the ground and two on the same base on which the column rests. The column is thought to represent a goddess, abstracted to avoid [[taboo]]ed direct representation.  Alternatively, the column has also been interpreted as symbolizing the entrance to the palace.  The lions are thus guarding the entrance to the palace and the walled fortification simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/4306/1/The_Lion_Gate_Relief.pdf|title=The Lion Gate Relief at Mycenae Reconsidered (PDF)|last=Shaw|first=Maria C.|date=1986|website=TSpace (University of Toronto), Archaeological Society of Athens, Greece|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif called the [[Tree of Life]], where two confronted animals graze on a shrub or tree, is also very ancient.

==Gebel el-Arak Knife==

The reverse side of the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] handle, displayed at the top of the article, shows two powerful confronted lions, separated by a figure who is grasping them. Of note, the knob on the reverse shows the top end of the hole for a cord or rope, on the suspension [[lug (knob)|lug]]; this knife may have been worn around the neck ceremonially.

==Examples from archaeology==

===Cylinder seals===

[[Image:Uruk3000BCE.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cylinder seal]] of [[Uruk]] displaying a confronted-lioness motif sometimes described as a ''"[[serpopard]]"'' - 3000 BC - [[Louvre]]]]
Examples of confronted animals exist on [[Cylinder seal]]s from [[Mesopotamia]]. [[deity|Deities]], or [[hero]]es grasping lionesses, cattle, [[griffin]]s, or other, imaginary creatures are sometimes found.

Many cylinder seals involving confronted [[goat]]s surrounding a central [[Tree of life]] on a 'cone' or 'mountain' platform share one common theme. Others may be thought of as deities holding the animals under their control.

Because cylinder seals are numerous and also come from [[prehistory|pre-historical]] periods, back to the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] or [[5th millennium BC]], themes are varied. Another Tree of life type of confronted animals cylinder seal has a "hero grasping water buffalo" and a "bull-man grasping lions", each between the animals; again, the central figure is the "Tree-of-Life" that often is interpreted as representing a goddess.

===Confronted snakes===
[[Image:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|Figure from [[Crete]], holding confronted snakes, dated 1600 BC. ]]
Confronted [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]]s are frequent images in many cultures from ancient times to historical periods. Often associated with religious ceremonies and deities, perhaps the most familiar figure known popularly from ancient times is the deity or priestess of Crete depicted holding up two confronted snakes on either side of her.

A [[chlorite]] vessel [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/wright/Fall03/ChloriteVase2.jpg] from the area of contemporary [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] is displayed at this link. It depicts three pairs of confronted animals. Two confronted [[snakes]] are being held in the hands of the central figure; below the snake-pair are a pair of ''anti-confronted-lionesses'' (although they turn their heads to face each other their hind quarters are closely confronted), recumbent. The third similar pair of animals on this item are two anti-confronted bovines with a human or deity between also. Two tumbling lions and other animals are depicted to the right.

===Narmer Palette===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|thumb|left|Narmer Palette with confronted lionesses, displayed in iconographic [[register (sculpture)|register]]s - ''Ancient Egypt c. 3,000 BC'']]
The [[Narmer Palette]], used to mix cosmetics in the receptacle on one side, has two confronted [[Felidae|felines]], sometimes called [[serpopard]]s (because of their exaggerated long necks which look snakelike to some researchers) forming the receptacle. Close examination of the animals with the exaggerated, long necks supports identification as [[lion]]esses. The entire theme of the Narmer Palette, is about the [[pharaoh]] of the newly unified [[Ancient Egypt]] represented in two scenes, (palette ''obverse'', palette ''reverse''). On one side the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and on the other, the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Lower Egypt]]. Thus, it is thought that the lionesses with their intertwining necks are representing two kingdoms, once separate, but now unified under one pharaoh. The lioness [[Bastet|Bast]] had been the protective deity of one kingdom and the lioness [[Sekhmet]] of the other kingdom, equally important deities in each of the early [[Egyptian pantheon]]s. Respectively, they were the special protectors of the pharaoh in each kingdom, who persisted as deities throughout the long history of unified [[Ancient Egypt]]. Eventually their roles diverged, however, with one becoming less of the protector and warrior deity and assigned other roles. Typically, many similar deities in the two kingdoms soon were merged, so the retention of both is thought to be the result of the long and strong tradition of each.

Examples of other confronted animals exist on many [[cosmetic palette]]s of Ancient Egypt that have been discovered.  One palette has confronted-[[hippopotamus]]es; others include giraffes, geese, and other animals familiar to the Egyptians. Bilaterally depicted [[palm tree]]s also are known as well on palettes.

===Mycenae Lion Gate===
[[Image:Mycenae lion gate detail dsc06384.jpg|thumb|225px|The Mycenae "Lion Gate" (detail) with two [[lion]]esses or lions that flank a central column|alt=]]
The gate to the citadel of [[Mycenae]] is shown to the right. It crowned the major entrance gateway to the ancient citadel that was the centre of the culture, [[Mycenaean Greece]], that predated that of [[Greece]], and is a well-known example of two confronted lionesses. Debate exists in research of this image, questioning whether these are leopards or lionesses confronted with a column between them that represents the deity, but the characteristic tufts at the end of the tails confirm the species. Many images of lioness related deities are depicted with heavier manes than typical for lionesses, but that may have been the result of attempts to interpretation of the species or, unfamiliarity with the atypical [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] differences within this feline species.  Alternatively, George Mylonas believed lions were depicted, not lionesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age|last=Mylonas|first=George|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0691035239|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek herald's staffs (kerykeia)===

In ancient Greece, heralds functioning as private messengers or public criers were referred to as ''kerykes''. The ''keryx'' has functions in political, military, judicional and religious matters. He was identified by his attribute, the herald's staff or ''kerykeion'', in Latin ''caduceus''. The attribute also offered him protection. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, also carries a ''kerykeion''. Kerykeia were often donated to temples by private persons and on state occasions. They are also found in herald's graves, and identify the profession of the buried person.

===Etruscan tomb mural===

{{Main|Tomb of the Leopards}}
Confronted leopards appear in a tomb found in Tarchuna ([[Tarquinia]]), or Tarchna Tarchnal, the chief of the [[Etruscan cities|twelve cities]] of [[Etruria]], a district in what is described as the [[Etruscan civilization]] that existed in Italy from 1200 BC through the 100 BC. It appears in the earliest history of [[Rome]], which was dominated by it until early in the 330s BC. This mural features confronted [[leopard]]s providing protection for a banquet in the afterlife. Frequently felines, lionesses and leopards such as these are confronted with a tree, shrub, or column between them in murals from this culture. The Etruscans are thought to have migrated from the area of Troy,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} through Greece where they absorbed many cultural elements, to Italy where they founded their culture in prehistoric times.

In Europe, confronted animals are an important motif in [[animal style]], or [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] decoration, [[Insular art]], and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. In these contexts there may be little or nothing between the two animals, and the emphasis is on the pair themselves.  Human figures are often treated in the same way, often mixed in with animals in decorative schemes - [[Archery|archer]]s were especially popular in the Romanesque period.

The early [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[ship burial]] found in contemporary Great Britain at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the seventh century AD, contains famous examples of [[Migration Period art]].  The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]] has three stylized confronted-animal pairs; the two side pairs, left and right, are identical, and have the animals in the person's clutched grasp. The central confronted animals are even more complex in theme.

Opposed animals are used in [[Insular art]], the style of which is derived from a mixture of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and northern European design traditions. Confronted animals, or animals intertwined in very intricate patterns, often depicted grabbing at each other to form the "gripping beast" pattern, are a main feature of some periods of [[Viking art]]. So intertwined are the animals, they are dissolved into pure ornament, and the individuals are barely discernable from each other.  Confronted animals are also frequently seen in European [[Romanesque art]], for example as decorative patterns in [[Romanesque architecture]].

[[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]] in [[heraldry]], not always a matched pair, continue the theme.

===Asian art===

====Luristan bronzes, Anatolian "animal" carpets====
{{See also|Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Luristan bronze}}

Confronted-animal motifs are found extensively in Asian art and in textiles, including [[Oriental rug|rug]]s, across [[Eurasia]].

Few examples still exist of a special type of Oriental [[Oriental rug|carpet]], termed "animal carpets" because their main feature are confronted animals. Dated to the 13th–16th century, they represent carpets woven during the transition period between the late [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] and the early [[Ottoman empire]]. Parallels were shown between the "opposed animal" and "latch-hook" motifs from woven pile rugs and the [[Lorestān bronze]]s.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Early Iron Age]] [[bronze]] artifacts of various individual forms which have been recovered from [[Lorestān Province|Lorestān]] and [[Kermanshah]] areas in west-central [[Iran]].

A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between phoenix and dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet now displayed at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin, and radiocarbon dated to the mid 15th century.

Since 1988, seven more carpets of the animal type have been found.

An almost complete animal carpet is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]].

"Animal carpets" were also depicted in Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th century, and thus represent the earliest Oriental carpets shown in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].

[[File:Powhatan's mantle, lithography 1888.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Powhatan's Mantle]]
"Powhatan's Mantle" is a cloak of [[deerskin]], which originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of high social status. Its decoration consists of shell beadwork, depicting a central standing human figure flanked by two upright, opposed quadrupeds and surrounded by 34 discs. The two animals resemble one another in terms of their overall outline, but their tails and paws differ. The left-hand animal has a long tail and round paws with five articulated digits. The right-hand animal has a shorter tail, and its legs end in cloven hoofs. Historically, this artwork was believed to have belonged [[Powhatan]], who was the [[paramount chief]] of [[Tsenacommacah]], an [[Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom|alliance]] of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Virginia Indians]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] at the time English settlers landed at [[History of the Jamestown Settlement (1607–1699)|Jamestown]] in 1607. "Powhatan's Mantle" is one of the earliest North American artifacts to be collected by Europeans that still survives today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant07-13.html "Powhatan's Mantle"] at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]], '''dual loyalty''' is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially conflict with each other.

==Inherently controversial==
While nearly all examples of alleged "dual loyalty" are considered highly controversial, these examples point to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between what constitutes a "danger" of dual loyalty – i.e., that there exists a pair of ''misaligned'' interests – versus what might be more simply a pair of ''partially aligned'' or even, according to the party being accused, a pair of ''fully aligned'' interests. For example, immigrants who still have feelings of loyalty to their country of origin will often insist that their two (or more) loyalties do not conflict. As Stanley A. Renshon at the Center for Immigration Studies notes,
{{quote|Lan Samantha Chang (1999), a novelist writing in response to the Wen Ho Lee case, could say in a ''New York Times'' op-ed piece entitled ''Debunking the Dual Loyalty Myth'', "True, many immigrants have strong ties to their countries of birth.&amp;nbsp;... But cultural or familial loyalties are on a different level from political allegiances&amp;nbsp;... I love China, but I am a citizen of the United States." Ms. Chang appears to want to distinguish a love for one's "home" country from being willing to commit treason against one's adopted one. This is obviously a fair, reasonable, and appropriate distinction.

Yet, in the process of making such a distinction, she acknowledges the duality of her feelings. The issue is not between love of one's country of origin and treason, but rather the multiple loyalties that appear to be part of many immigrants' psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Renshon|Stanley A. Renshon]]. "[http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshon1812.html Dual Citizenship and Conflict: The War of 1812 Redux?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417080312/http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshon1812.html |date=April 17, 2006}}" Center for Immigration Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Transnationalist interpretations===
Some scholars refer to a growing trend of [[transnationalism]] and suggest that as societies become more [[heterogeneous]] and [[multi-cultural]], the term "dual loyalty" increasingly becomes a meaningless [[Bromide (language)|bromide]]. According to the theory of transnationalism, migration (as well as other factors including improved global communication) produces new forms of identity that transcend traditional notions of physical and cultural space. Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, and Cristina Blanc-Szanton define a process by which immigrants "link together" their country of origin and their country of settlement.

The transnationalist view is that "dual loyalty" is a potentially ''positive'' expression of multi-culturalism, and can contribute to the diversity and strength of civil society. While this view is popular in many academic circles, others are skeptical of this idea. As one paper describes it,
{{quote|On occasion, these imagined communities conform to the root meaning of transnational, extending beyond loyalties that connect to any specific place of origin or ethnic or national group. Yet what immigration scholars describe as transnationalism is usually its opposite ... highly particularistic attachments antithetical to those by-products of globalization denoted by the concept of "transnational civil society" and its related manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldinger |first=Roger |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=David |date=March 2004 |title=Transnationalism in Question |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/waldinger/pdf/B7.pdf |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=109 |issue=5 |page=1178 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond its usage in particular instances, the term "dual loyalty" versus "transnationalism" continues to be the subject of much debate. As one academic writes:
{{quote|Although the events of September 11th may have shaken some assumptions – at least in the United States – about the nature of transnational networks and their capacity to facilitate flows of people, goods, and ideas across borders, the terms "globalization" and "transnationalism" remain relatively stable, albeit frustratingly imprecise additions to the language of social sciences, including anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wagner |first=Sarah |year=2002 |title=Putting a Face on Transnationalism: Migration, Identity, and Membership in the Transnational City of Johannesburg |page=2 |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408221056/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf |archivedate=April 8, 2005 |postscript=. |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical accusations==
Other historical examples of actual or perceived "dual loyalty" include the following:
* During [[World War II]], a number of [[United States]] citizens of [[Japanese Americans|Japanese]], [[German Americans|German]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[ancestry]], including some born in the U.S., were confined to [[internment]] camps (see [[Japanese internment in the United States]]).
* [[Roman Catholic]]s are subject to the [[Pope]] on religious matters. This has often perceived as dual loyalty by powers opposed to the [[Holy See]].
** During the [[English Reformation]], many important English and Scottish figures, such as [[Thomas More]], [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Edmund Campion]], were tried and executed for their alleged double loyalty to the Papacy and infidelity to the Crown.
** During the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 19th-century France, citizens were routinely divided between ''clericals'' and ''anticlericals'' because of long-lasting loyalty related conflicts between the French secularist government and the Holy See.
** During [[John F. Kennedy]]'s campaign for and brief [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|tenure as U.S. President]], some opponents questioned whether a Roman Catholic President of the United States had a divided loyalty with respect to the [[Papacy]] and [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnfkennedy/biography/theamericanfranchise.common.shtml AmericanPresident.org article on John F. Kennedy]&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese Catholics]] have been forced by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] to substitute the Roman Catholic Church in China by the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]].
* [[Jewish people|Jews]] in the [[Jewish Diaspora]] have been accused of dual loyalty by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century, by the [[French people|French]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]] in the late 19th century, in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin-era]] [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Zakim"&gt;[[Leonard P.

An '''environmental impact statement''' ('''EIS'''), under [[United States environmental law]], is a document required by the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) for certain actions "significantly affecting the quality of the human environment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 USC Sections  4321-4347] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017083720/http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm |date=2008-10-17 }} (enacted 1970-01-01) from [http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/nepanet.htm Council on Environmental Quality NEPAnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172140/http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/nepanet.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An EIS is a tool for decision making.  It describes the positive and negative [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental effects]] of a proposed action, and it usually also lists one or more alternative actions that may be chosen instead of the action described in the EIS. Several [[U.S. state]] governments require that a document similar to an EIS be submitted to the state for certain actions.  For example, in California, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be submitted to the state for certain actions, as described in the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA). One of the primary authors of the act is [[Lynton K. Caldwell]].

==Purpose==
The purpose of the NEPA is to promote informed decision-making by federal agencies by making "detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts" available to both agency leaders and the public.&lt;ref&gt;See the Supreme Court decision: ''Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council'', 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  The NEPA was the first piece of legislation that created a comprehensive method to assess potential and existing environmental risks at once.  It also encourages communication and cooperation between all the actors involved in environmental decisions, including government officials, private businesses, and citizens.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, an EIS acts as an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the federal government adheres to the goals and policies outlined in the NEPA.  An EIS should be created in a timely manner as soon as the agency is planning development or is presented with a proposal for development.  The statement should use an interdisciplinary approach so that it accurately assesses both the physical and social impacts of the proposed development.&lt;ref name="EIS"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances an action may be deemed subject to NEPA’s EIS requirement even though the action is not specifically sponsored by a federal agency. These factors may include actions that receive federal funding, federal licensing or authorization, or that are subject to federal control.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2008). [https://www.amazon.com/NEPA-Environmental-Planning-Techniques-Practitioners/dp/0849375592/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486526090&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=NEPA+and+Environmental+Planning%3A+Tools%2C+Techniques%2C+and+Approaches+for+Practitioners NEPA and Environmental Planning: Tools, Techniques, and Approaches for Practitioners], pp 148-149. CRC Press. {{ISBN|9780849375590}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all federal actions require a full EIS.  If the action may or may not cause a significant impact, the agency can first prepare a smaller, shorter document called an '''Environmental Assessment''' (EA).  The finding of the EA determines whether an EIS is required.  If the EA indicates that no significant impact is likely, then the agency can release a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and carry on with the proposed action.  Otherwise, the agency must then conduct a full-scale EIS.  Most EAs result in a FONSI.  A limited number of federal actions may avoid the EA and EIS requirements under NEPA if they meet the criteria for a categorical exclusion (CATEX).  A CATEX is usually permitted when a course of action is identical or very similar to a past course of action and the impacts on the environment from the previous action can be assumed for the proposed action, or for building a structure within the footprint of an existing, larger facility or complex.  For example, two proposed sections of [[Interstate 69 in Kentucky]] were granted a CATEX from NEPA requirements as these portions of I-69 will be routed over existing freeways requiring little more than minor spot improvements and a change of highway signage.   Additionally, a CATEX can be issued during an [[emergency]] when time does not permit the preparation of an EA or EIS.  An example of the latter is when the Federal Highway Administration issued a CATEX to construct the [[I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge|replacement bridge]] in the wake of the [[I-35W Mississippi River Bridge Collapse]].

Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, but merely requires that the prospective impacts be understood and disclosed in advance.  The intent of NEPA is to help key decisionmakers and stakeholders balance the need to implement an action with its impacts on the surrounding human and natural environment, and provide opportunities for mitigating those impacts while keeping the cost and schedule for implementing the action under control.  However, many activities require various federal permits to comply with other environmental legislation, such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], [[Endangered Species Act]] and Section 4(f) of the [[Federal Highway Act]] to name a few. Similarly, many states and local jurisdictions have enacted environmental laws and ordinances, requiring additional state and local permits before the action can proceed.  Obtaining these permits typically requires the lead agency to implement the '''Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA)''' to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws that are ancillary to NEPA.  In some instances, the result of NEPA analysis leads to abandonment or cancellation of the proposed action, particularly when the "No Action" alternative ends up being the LEDPA.

==Layout==
An EIS typically has four sections:&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2014). The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements. Chapter 6. CRC Press. {{ISBN|978-1466583634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* An Introduction including a statement of the '''Purpose and Need''' of the '''Proposed Action'''.
:* A description of the '''Affected Environment'''.
:* A '''Range of Alternatives''' to the proposed action.  Alternatives are considered the "heart" of the EIS.
:* An '''analysis''' of the environmental impacts of each of the possible alternatives.  This section covers topics such as:
::* Impacts to '''threatened or endangered species'''
::* '''Air and water quality''' impacts
::* Impacts to '''historic and cultural sites, particularly sites of significant importance to Indigenous peoples. 
::* '''Social and Economic impacts''' to local communities, often including consideration of attributes such as '''impacts to available housing stock, economic impacts to businesses, property values, aesthetics and noise''' within the affected area
::* '''Cost and Schedule Analyses''' for each alternative, including costs and timeline to mitigate expected impacts, to determine if the proposed action can be completed at a acceptable cost and within a reasonable amount of time 
While not required in the EIS, the following subjects may be included as part of the EIS or as separate documents based on agency policy.
:* '''Financial Plan''' for the proposed action identifying the sources of secured funding for the action.  For example, the Federal Highway Administration has started requiring states to include a financial plan showing that funding has been secured for major highway projects before it will approve an EIS and issue a Record of Decision.
:* An '''Environmental Mitigation Plan''' is often requested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if substantial environmental impacts are expected from the preferred alternative.
:* '''Additional documentation''' to comply with state and local environmental policy laws and secure required federal, state, and local permits before the action can proceed.

Every EIS is required to analyze a '''No Action Alternative,''' in addition to the range of alternatives presented for study.  The No Action Alternative identifies the expected environmental impacts in the future if existing conditions were left as is with no action taken by the lead agency.  Analysis of the No Action Alternative is used to establish a baseline upon which to compare the proposed "Action" alternatives.

==NEPA process==
The NEPA process is designed to involve the public and gather the best available information in a single place so that decision makers can be fully informed when they make their choices.

This is the process of EIS
* '''Proposal:''' In this stage, the needs and objectives of a project have been decided, but the project has not been financed.
* '''Categorical Exclusion (CATEX):''' As discussed above, the government may exempt an agency from the process.  The agency can then proceed with the project and skip the remaining steps.
* '''Environmental Assessment (EA):''' The proposal is analyzed in addition to the local environment with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of the development on the area.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI):'''  Occurs when no significant impacts are identified in an EA.  A FONSI typically allows the lead agency to proceed without having to complete an EIS.

''Environmental Impact Statement''
* '''Scoping:''' The first meetings are held to discuss existing laws, the available information, and the research needed.  The tasks are divided up and a lead group is selected.  Decision makers and all those involved with the project can attend the meetings.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Notice:'''  The public is notified that the agency is preparing an EIS.  The agency also provides the public with information regarding how they can become involved in the process.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The agency announces its project proposal with a notice in the [[Federal Register]], notices in local media, and letters to citizens and groups that it knows are likely to be interested. Citizens and groups are welcome to send in comments helping the agency identify the issues it must address in the EIS (or EA).
* '''Draft EIS (DEIS):''' Based on both agency expertise and issues raised by the public, the agency prepares a Draft EIS with a full description of the affected environment, a reasonable range of alternatives, and an analysis of the impacts of each alternative.
* '''Comment:''' Affected individuals then have the opportunity to provide feedback through written and public hearing statements.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Final EIS (FEIS) and Proposed Action:''' Based on the comments on the Draft EIS, the agency writes a Final EIS, and announces its Proposed Action.  The public is not invited to comment on this, but if they are still unhappy, or feel that the agency has missed a major issue, they may protest the EIS to the Director of the agency.  The Director may either ask the agency to revise the EIS, or explain to the protester why their complaints are not actually taken care of.
*'''Re-evaluation:'''  Prepared following an approved FEIS or ROD when unforeseen changes to the proposed action or its impacts occurs, or when a substantial period of time has passed between approval of an action and the planned start of said action.  Based on the significance of the changes, three outcomes may result from a re-evaluation report:  (1) the action may proceed with no substantive changes to the FEIS, (2) significant impacts are expected with the change that can be adequately addressed in a Supplemental EIS (SEIS), or (3) the circumstances force a complete change in the nature and scope of the proposed action, thereby voiding the pre-existing FEIS (and ROD, if applicable), requiring the lead agency to restart the NEPA process and prepare a new EIS to encompass the changes.
* '''Supplemental EIS (SEIS):''' Typically prepared after either a Final EIS or Record of Decision has been issued and new environmental impacts that were not considered in the original EIS are discovered, requiring the lead agency to re-evaluate its initial decision and consider new alternatives to avoid or mitigate the new impacts.  Supplemental EISs are also prepared when the size and scope of a federal action changes, when a significant period of time has lapsed since the FEIS was completed to account for changes in the surrounding environment during that time, or when all of the proposed alternatives in an EIS are deemed to have unacceptable environmental impacts and new alternatives are proposed.
* '''[[Record of Decision]] (ROD):''' Once all the protests are resolved the agency issues a Record of Decision which is its final action prior to implementation.  If members of the public are still dissatisfied with the outcome, they may sue the agency in Federal court.

Often, the agencies responsible for preparing an EA or EIS do not compile the document directly, but outsource this work to private-sector consulting firms with expertise in the proposed action and its anticipated effects on the environment.  Because of the intense level of detail required in analyzing the alternatives presented in an EIS or EA, such documents may take years or even decades to compile, and often compose of multiple volumes that can be thousands to tens of thousands of pages in length.

To avoid potential conflicts in securing required permits and approvals after the ROD is issued, the lead agency will often coordinate with stakeholders at all levels, and resolve any conflicts to the greatest extent possible during the EIS process.  Proceeding in this fashion helps avoid interagency conflicts and potential lawsuits after the lead agency reaches its decision.

===Tiering===
On exceptionally large projects, especially proposed highway and railroad corridors that cross long distances, the lead agency may use a two-tiered process prior to implementing the proposed action.  In such cases, the Tier I EIS would analyze the potential socio-environmental impacts along a general corridor, but would not identify the exact location of where the action would occur.  A Tier I ROD would be issued approving the general area where the action would be implemented.  Following the Tier I ROD, the approved Tier I area is further broken down into subareas, and a Tier II EIS is then prepared for each subarea, that identifies the exact location of where the proposed action will take place.  The preparation of Tier II EISs for each subarea proceeds at its own pace, independent from the other subareas within the Tier I area. For example, parts of the proposed [[Interstate 69]] extension in [[Indiana]] and [[Texas]] are being studied through a two-tiered process

==Strengths==
By requiring agencies to complete an EIS, the act encourages them to consider the environmental costs of a project and introduces new information into the decision-making process.  The NEPA has increased the influence of environmental analysts and agencies in the federal government by increasing their involvement in the development process.  Because an EIS requires expert skill and knowledge, agencies must hire environmental analysts.  Unlike agencies who may have other priorities, analysts are often sympathetic to environmental issues.  In addition, this feature introduces scientific procedures into the political process.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1984"&gt;Taylor, Serge. 1984. "Making Bureaucracies Think: The Environmental Impact Statement Strategy of Administrative Reform". Stanford University Press: Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The differences that exist between science and politics limit the accuracy of an EIS.  Although analysts are members of the scientific community, they are affected by the political atmosphere.  Analysts do not have the luxury of an unlimited time for research.  They are also affected by the different motives behind the research of the EIS and by different perspectives of what constitutes a good analysis.  In addition, government officials do not want to reveal an environmental problem from within their own agency.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1984"/&gt;

Citizens often misunderstand the environmental assessment process.  The public does not realize that the process is only meant to gather information relevant to the decision.  Even if the statement predicts negative impacts of the project, decision makers can still proceed with the proposal.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

Environmental impact statements presented to citizens and government officials frequently include very precise data.  However, the quality and context of the data, such as the margin of error and the range, is omitted.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">{{Antennas|components}}

In a radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], the '''feed line''' ('''feedline'''), or '''feeder''', is the cable or other [[transmission line]] that connects the antenna with the radio [[transmitter]] or [[Radio receiver|receiver]].   In a transmitting antenna, it feeds the [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electric current|current]] from the transmitter to the antenna, where it is radiated as [[radio wave]]s.  In a receiving antenna it transfers the tiny RF voltage induced in the antenna by the radio wave to the receiver.  In order to carry RF current efficiently, feed lines are made of specialized types of cable called [[transmission line]].    The most widely used types of feed line are [[coaxial cable]], [[twin-lead]], [[ladder line]], and at [[microwave]] frequencies, [[waveguide]].

Particularly with a transmitting antenna, the feed line is a critical component that must be adjusted to work correctly with the antenna and transmitter.  Each type of transmission line has a specific [[characteristic impedance]].  This must be matched to the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the antenna and the transmitter, to transfer power efficiently to the antenna.  If these impedances are not matched it can cause a condition called [[standing wave]]s on the feed line, in which the RF energy is reflected back toward the transmitter, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter.  This adjustment is done with a device called an [[antenna tuner]] in the transmitter, and sometimes a [[matching network]] at the antenna.  The degree of mismatch between the feedline and the antenna is measured by an instrument called an [[SWR meter]] (standing wave ratio meter), which measures the ''[[standing wave ratio]]'' (SWR) on the line.  

==Twin-lead==
{{Main|Twin-lead}}
Twin lead is used to connect [[FM radio]]s and [[television receiver]]s with their antennas, although it has been largely replaced in the latter application by coaxial cable, and as a feedline for low power transmitters such as [[amateur radio]] transmitters.  It consists of two wire [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] running parallel to each other with a precisely constant spacing, molded in [[polyethylene]] [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] material in a flat ribbon-like cable.  The distance between the two wires is small relative to the [[wavelength]] of the RF signal carried on the wire.  Furthermore, the RF [[Electric current|current]] in one wire is equal in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and opposite in [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted).  Thus, if both wires [[Radiation|radiate]] energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies.  Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires at the same time and equally in magnitude and direction.  At the end of the transmission line the inverted signal wire is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted signal wire by the receiving circuitry.  Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out.  

Twin lead is considered a [[Balanced line]].

==Coaxial cable==
[[File:Antenne gp vhf 2.jpg|thumb|Coaxial cable feedline emerging from a VHF [[ground plane antenna]]. ]]
{{Main|Coaxial cable}}

Coaxial cable is probably the most widely used type of feedline, used for frequencies below the [[microwave]] ([[Superhigh frequency|SHF]]) range.    It consists of a wire center conductor and a braided or solid metallic "shield" conductor, usually [[copper]] or [[aluminum]] surrounding it.    The center conductor is separated from the  outer shield by a [[dielectric]], usually plastic foam, to keep the separation between the two conductors precisely constant.  The shield is covered with an outer plastic insulation jacket.  In ''hard coax'' cable, used for high power transmitting applications like [[television transmitter]]s, the shield is a rigid or flexible metal pipe containing a compressed gas such as [[nitrogen]], and the internal conductor is held centered with periodic plastic spacers.  It is a type of [[unbalanced line]], the shield conductor is usually connected to electrical [[ground (electricity)|ground]].  Coaxial cable's advantage is that the enclosing shield conductor isolates the cable from external electromagnetic fields, so it is very immune to interference.

==Waveguide==
[[File:Radar antenna feed waveguide.png|thumb|Complicated waveguide feed of a military radar]]
{{Main|Waveguide}}

[[Waveguide]] is used at [[microwave]] ([[Superhigh frequency|SHF]]) frequencies, at which other types of feedline have excessive power losses.  A waveguide is a hollow metallic conductor or pipe.  It can have a circular or square cross-section.  Waveguide runs are often pressurized with nitrogen gas to keep moisure out. The [[RF signal]] travels through the pipe similarly to the way sound travels in a tube. The metal walls keep it from radiating energy outwards and also prevent interference from entering the waveguide.  Because of the cost and maintenance waveguide entails, microwave antennas often have the output stage of the transmitter or the [[RF front end]] of the receiver located at the antenna, and the signal is fed to or from the rest of the transmitter or receiver at a lower frequency, using coaxial cable. 

A waveguide is considered an unbalanced [[transmission line]].

[[File:Helmand leaflets350.jpg|thumb|[[Airborne leaflet propaganda|Distribution of leaflets]] over [[Afghanistan]] by the U.S. military in 2010]]
[[File:Flyers in China 02.jpg|thumb|Flyers pasted to a wall in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]]]

A '''flyer''' is a form of [[paper]] [[advertisement]] intended for wide distribution and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail. In the 2010s, flyers range from inexpensively [[photocopier|photocopied]] leaflets to expensive, glossy, full-color circulars.

==Terminology==
A flyer is also called a "flier", "circular", "handbill", "[[pamphlet]]", "poster", "lit'" (literature), "weekly ad", "catalogue" or "leaflet".{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Flyers may be used by individuals, [[business]]es, not-for-profit organizations or governments to:
* Advertise an event such as a music [[concert]], [[nightclub]] appearance, [[festival]], or political [[Demonstration (people)|rally]]
* Promote a [[Good (economics)|good]]s-selling businesses such as a [[used car]] lot [[discount store]] or a [[Service (economics)|service]] business such as a [[restaurant]] or [[massage parlour]].
* Persuade people about a social, religious, or political message, as in [[evangelism]] or [[political campaign]] activities on behalf of a [[political party]] or candidate during an election. Flyers have been used in armed conflict: for example, [[airborne leaflet propaganda]] has been a tactic of [[psychological warfare]].
* Recruit members for organizations or companies.

Like [[postcard]]s, [[pamphlet]]s and small [[poster]]s, flyers are a low-cost form of [[mass marketing]] or [[communication]]. There are many different flyer formats. Some examples include:
* [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] (roughly [[letterhead]] size)
* A5 (roughly half letterhead size)
* DL ([[compliments slip]] size)
* A6 ([[postcard]] size)

[[File:Commonsense.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] was a pamphlet that was distributed preceding the American Revolution]]
Flyers are inexpensive to produce and they required only a basic [[printing press]] from the 18th century to the 20th century. Their widespread use intensified in the 1990s with the spread of less expensive [[desktop publishing]] systems. In the 2010s, inexpensive black and white flyers can be produced with just a [[personal computer]] and a [[computer printer]]. In the 2010s, the ordering of flyers through traditional printing services has been supplanted by [[Internet]] services. Customers send designs, review proofs online or via e-mail and receive the final products by mail.

Flyers are not a new medium: prior to the [[War of American Independence]] some colonists were outraged with the [[Stamp Act (1765)]] and gathered together in anti-stamp act congresses and meetings. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued handbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other written paraphernalia, to do so.

In the 2000s, some jurisdictions have laws or [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] banning or restricting leafleting or flyering in certain locations. Owners of private property may put up signs saying "Post No Bills"; this occurs particularly on wooden fences surrounding building sites or vacant lots.

==Distribution and use==
Flyers are handed out on the [[street]] (a practice known as "flyering" or "leafleting"), distributed door-to-door through the mail, posted on [[bulletin board]]s, put under windshield wipers of cars, given away at events or on the street, or affixed to telephone poles, walls, or other surfaces. Bulletin boards are found on [[college campus]]es, in [[café]]s, community meeting houses, [[laundromat]]s and small markets. Cheap to produce, contemporary flyers are frequently produced in 300&amp;nbsp;[[paper density|g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] glossy card, whereas a leaflet might be produced on a 130&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–170&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weight paper and can be a very effective form of [[direct marketing]].

In the 2010s, some individuals and organizations send flyers through [[e-mail]], a tactic that avoids spending money on paper, printing and mailing or hiring people to post the flyers on telephone poles or hand them out. The electronic [http://www.chapmatin.com/%da%86%d8%a7%d9%be-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%aa/ flyer] may be embedded into the body of the e-mail or added as an attachment to be opened.

The '''German Aerospace Center''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.}}), abbreviated '''DLR''', is the national center for aerospace, energy and transportation research of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Cologne]] and it has multiple other locations throughout Germany. The DLR is engaged in a wide range of [[research and development]] projects in national and international partnerships. In addition to conducting its own research projects, DLR also acts as the German [[space agency]]. As such, it is responsible for planning and implementing the German space programme on behalf of the [[Cabinet of Germany|German federal government]]. As a project management agency, DLR also coordinates and answers the technical and organisational implementation of projects funded by a number of German federal ministries.

== Overview ==
[[File:Raumfahrt-Kontrollzentrum 9900.jpg|thumb|German Space Operations Center (GSOC) in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] near [[Munich]].]]
DLR has approximately 8000 employees at 20 locations in Germany. Its institutes and facilities are spread over 13 sites, as well as offices in [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] DLR has a budget of about 670 million euro to cover its own research, development and operations. Approximately one third of this sum comes from competitively allocated [[Research funding|third-party funds]] (German: ''Drittmittel''). In addition to this, DLR administers around 500 million euro in German funds for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). In its capacity as project management agency, it manages over 650 million euro in research on behalf of German federal ministries. DLR is a full member of the [[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems]] (CCSDS) and a member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]].

In the context of DLR's initiatives to promote young research talent, ten [[DLR School Lab]]s were set up in Berlin-Adlershof, [[Braunschweig]], [[Bremen]], Cologne-Porz, [[Dortmund]], [[Göttingen]], Hamburg-Harburg, Lampoldshausen/Stuttgart, [[Neustrelitz]], and [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] over the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/schoollab/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1722/3663_read-18208/ | title = DLR_School_Lab - The DLR_School_Labsn | accessdate = 2013-01-15 | work = DLR Portal | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DLR School Labs, school pupils can become acquainted with the practical aspects of natural and engineering sciences by conducting interesting experiments.

The modern DLR was created in 1997, but was the culmination of over half a dozen space, aerospace, and research institutes from across the 20th century.

The oldest predecessor organization of DLR was established by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in Göttingen in 1907. This ''Modellversuchsanstalt der Motorluftschiff-Studiengesellschaft'' (MLStG; German for "Institute for Testing of Aerodynamic Models of the Powered Airship Society") later became the ''[[Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt]]'' ("Aerodynamics Laboratory" or "Aerodynamic Experimental Station"). In the 1940s the DVL (an AVA sister organization) funded [[Konrad Zuse]]'s work on the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] and [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] computers. Another German aviation technology research facility, the 1935-founded, top-secret ''[[Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt]]'' at [[Völkenrode]] which conducted research — much of it for military aviation to suit the Luftwaffe's needs — in parallel to the then-existing forerunners of the DLR of today, would not be discovered by the Allies until after the war's end.

In 1947 the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Weltraumfahrt'' ("Consortium on Space Flight") was formed, leading to the ''Gesellschaft für Weltraumforschung'' (GfW;  "Society for Space Research") being formed in 1948.&lt;ref name=de100&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/100Jahre/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2581/4435_read-7391/ | title = Space flight in Germany – timeline including important events | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2007-02-04 | work = 100 Years | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the Research Institute of Jet Propulsion Physics (FPS) was established at the Stuttgart airport.&lt;ref name="DLR Stuttgart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-344/999_read-1358/ |title=DLR site Stuttgart |work=DRL Portal |publisher=German Aerospace Center |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was later called the DLR was formed in 1969 as the ''Deutsche Forschungs- und Versuchsanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrt'' (DFVLR;  "German Test and Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight") through the merger of several institutions. These were the ''[[Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt]]'' (AVA), the ''[[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (DVL; "German Laboratory for Aviation"), the ''[[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (DFL; "German Research Institute for Aviation") and (in 1972) the ''Gesellschaft für Weltraumforschung'' (GfW; "Society for Space Research").

In 1989, the DFVLR was renamed ''Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrt'' (DLR;  "German Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight").  Also in 1989, the ''[[Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten]]'' (DARA;  "German Agency for Space Flight Affairs") was created.&lt;ref name=de100/&gt;

Following the merger with the ''Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten'' (DARA; German for "German Agency for Space Flight Affairs") on 1 October 1997, the name was changed to "Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt" (DLR), literally "German Center for Aviation and Space Flight". The shorter translation "German Aerospace Center" is used in English-language publications.

Other German space organizations include the ''Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme'' (IRS; [[Institute for Space Systems]]), founded in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Space-Systems-and-Industry/Institut-Fur-Raumfahrtsysteme-Germany.html|title=Defense &amp; Security Intelligence &amp; Analysis: IHS Jane's - IHS|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with DLR's ''Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme'' located in Bremen.&lt;ref name='DLR Bremen'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3523/7991_read-12992/ | title = DLR’s Bremen Site | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2010-01-28 | work = DLR Portal | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, significant contributions are made to the [[European Space Organization]].

== Research ==
[[File:DLR Helikopter.JPG|thumb|The DLR Institute of Flight Systems operates this helicopter as part of the [[Flying Helicopter Simulator]] (FHS)]]

DLR’s mission comprises the exploration of the Earth and the solar system, as well as research aimed at protecting the environment and developing environmentally compatible technologies, and at promoting mobility, communication and security. DLR’s research portfolio, which covers the four focus areas [[Aviation|Aeronautics]], [[Spaceflight|Space]], [[Transport]]ation and [[Energy]], ranges from [[basic research]] to innovative applications. DLR operates large-scale research centres, both for the benefit of its own projects and as a service for its clients and partners from the worlds of business and science.

The objective of DLR’s [[aeronautics]] research is to strengthen the competitive advantage of the national and European aeronautical industry and aviation sector, and to meet political and social demands – for instance with regard to climate-friendly aviation. German [[space exploration|space research]] activities range from experiments under conditions of weightlessness to the exploration of other planets and environmental monitoring from space. In addition to these activities, DLR performs tasks of public authority pertaining to the planning and implementation of the German space programme, in its capacity as the official space agency of the Federal Republic of Germany. DLR’s Project Management Agency (German: ''Projektträger im DLR'') has also been entrusted with tasks of public authority pertaining to the administration of subsidies. In the field of [[energy development|energy research]], DLR is working on highly efficient, low-{{CO2}} power generation technologies based on gas turbines and fuel cells, on solar thermal power generation, and on the efficient use of heat, including [[cogeneration]] based on fossil and renewable energy sources. The topics covered by DLR’s [[Transport engineering|transportation research]] are maintaining mobility, protecting the environment and saving resources, and improving transportation safety.

In addition to the already existing projects [[Mars Express]], [[global navigation satellite system]] [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], and [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]], the Institute of Space Systems (German: ''Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme'') was founded in Bremen on 26 January 2007. In the future, 80 scientists and engineers will be doing research into topics such as space mission concepts, satellite development and propulsion technology.

=== Planetary research ===

==== Mars Express ====
[[File:Ceraunius Tholus in perspective by Mars Express.jpg|thumb|Martian volcano Ceraunius Tholus in perspective by the HRSC aboard Mars Express]]
The High Resolution Stereo Camera [[High Resolution Stereo Camera|HRSC]] is the most important German contribution to the European Space Agency’s [[Mars Express]] mission. It is the first digital stereo camera that also generates multispectral data and that has a very high resolution lens. The camera records images of the Martian surface which formed the basis for a large number of scientific studies. With the HRSC, which was developed at the German Aerospace Center’s Institute of Planetary Research (German: ''Institut für Planetenforschung''), it is possible to analyse details no larger than 10 to 30 meters in three dimensions.

==== Rosetta and Philae ====
[[File:Rosetta's Philae on Comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ''Philae'' on [[Churyumov-Gerasimenko]]]]
The [[comet]] orbiter [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'']] is controlled from the [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC), in [[Darmstadt]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/20/world/europe/rosetta-comet-probe/index.html |title=Comet-chasing probe wakes up, calls home |publisher=CNN |first1=Michael |last1=Pearson |first2=Matt |last2=Smith |date=21 January 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLR has provided the structure, thermal subsystem, flywheel, the Active Descent System (procured by DLR but made in Switzerland),&lt;ref name="moog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moog.com/literature/Space_Defense/Spacecraft/Propulsion/active_descent_system.pdf |title=Active Descent System |publisher=[[Moog Inc.]] |accessdate=11 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112012855/http://www.moog.com/literature/Space_Defense/Spacecraft/Propulsion/active_descent_system.pdf |archive-date=12 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ROLIS, downward-looking camera, SESAME, acoustic sounding and seismic instrument for [[Philae (spacecraft)|''Philae'']], the orbiter's landing unit. It has also managed the project and did the level product assurance.

The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] made the payload engineering, eject mechanism, landing gear, anchoring harpoon, central computer, COSAC, APXS and other subsystems.

==== Dawn ====
The framing cameras, provided by the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] and the DLR, are the main imaging instruments of Dawn, a multi-destination space probe to the [[protoplanet]]s [[4 Vesta]] and [[1 Ceres]] launched in 2007.&lt;ref name="Rayman 2006 605–616"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rayman |first=Marc |author2=Fraschetti, Thomas C. |author3=Raymond, Carol A. |author4=Russell, Christopher T. |title=Dawn: A mission in development for exploration of main belt asteroids Vesta and Ceres |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=April 5, 2006 |volume=58 |pages=605–616 |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/Dawn_overview.pdf |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.01.014 |issue=11 |bibcode=2006AcAau..58..605R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cameras offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres.&lt;ref name=sierks&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11214-011-9745-4 | title = The Dawn Framing Camera | year = 2011 | last1 = Sierks | first1 = H. | last2 = Keller | first2 = H.

=== Manned spaceflight ===

==== Columbus ====
[[Image:S122e008264.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus Module]] on the [[International Space Station]] orbiting the Earth in 2008]]

DLR operates the [[Columbus Control Center]] in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]], [[Germany]]. It is responsible for the coordination of scientific activities as well as for systems operations and life support on board the orbiting Columbus laboratory.

In February 2008, the [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus laboratory]], Europe’s core contribution to the International Space Station [[International Space Station|ISS]], was brought into space by the Space Shuttle and docked to the ISS. The cylindrical module, which has a diameter of {{convert|4.5|m|ftin}}, contains state-of-the-art scientific equipment. It is planned to enable researchers on Earth to conduct thousands of experiments in biology, materials science, fluid physics and many other fields under conditions of weightlessness in space.

[[Image:STS-61-a-patch.png|thumb|right|The ''Deutschland-1'' orbital space plane flight, funded by West Germany, included over {{convert|7|short ton|t|order=flip}} of German science research equipment]]

==== Spacelab, Shuttle, Mir, Soyuz ====
Germany has near ten astronauts and participates in ESA manned space programs including flights of German astronauts aboard US [[Space Shuttle]]s and Russian spacecraft. Besides missions under ESA and flights on [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] and [[Mir]], two Space Shuttle missions with the European built [[Spacelab]] were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by Germany (like a separate few by [[ESA]] and one by [[Japan]]) with German astronauts on board as hosts and not guests. The first West German mission ''[[Deutschland 1]]'' (Spacelab-D1, DLR-1, NASA designation [[STS-61-A]]) took place in 1985. 

The second similar mission, ''[[Deutschland 2]]'' (Spacelab-D2, DLR-2, NASA designation [[STS-55]]), was first planned for 1988, but then due to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] was delayed until 1993 when it became the first German manned space mission after [[German reunification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124617/http://fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth-bound research and aeronautics ===

==== Remote sensing of the Earth ====
In [[remote sensing]] of the Earth, [[satellite]]s provide comprehensive and continually updated information on "System Earth". This remote sensing data is used to investigate the Earth’s atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces, and ice sheets. Practical applications of this technology include environmental monitoring and disaster relief.

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004]], for instance, up-to-date maps could be compiled very quickly using Earth observation satellites. These maps could then be used for orientation during relief missions. DLR conducts these research activities at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) (German: ''Deutsches Fernerkundungsdatenzentrum''), a DLR institute based in Oberpfaffenhofen. Nowadays, satellite data is also important for [[Climatology|climate research]]: it is used to measure temperatures, {{CO2}} levels, [[Particulate|particulate matter]] levels, rainforest deforestation and the [[Albedo|radiation conditions]] of the Earth’s surface (land, oceans, polar ice).

==== TerraSAR-X ====
The new German Earth observation satellite [[TerraSAR-X]] was launched in June 2007. The objective of this five-year mission is to provide radar remote sensing data to scientific and commercial users. The satellite’s design is based on the technology and expertise developed in the X-SAR and SRTM SAR missions ([[Synthetic aperture radar|Synthetic Aperture Radar]]). The sensor has a number of different modes of operation, with a maximum resolution of one meter, and is capable of generating elevation profiles.

TerraSAR-X is the first satellite that was jointly paid for by government and industry. DLR contributed about 80 percent of the total expenses, with the remainder being covered by [[EADS Astrium]]. The satellite's core component is a radar sensor operating in the X band and capable of recording the Earth’s surface using a range of different modes of operation, capturing an area of 10 to 100 kilometers in size with  a resolution of 1 to 16 meters.

====Astronomical surveys====
The [[Uppsala-DLR Trojan Survey]] (UDTS) was a search for asteroids near [[Jupiter]] in the 1990s, in collaboration with the Swedish [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]]. When it concluded there was another survey, the [[UAO-DLR Asteroid Survey]], this time with a focus on [[Near Earth asteroids]] and both surveys discovered numerous objects.

==== Suborbital Spaceplane ====
Studying a [[suborbital spaceplane]], DLR conducted [[Falke (spacecraft)|Falke]] prototype for [[Hermes (spaceplane)|Hermes]] spaceplane program, participates in non-realized [[Sanger II]] project and since 2005 work under the concept making fast intercontinental passenger transport possible. The [[SpaceLiner]] is a reusable vehicle lifting-off vertically and landing like a glider.

==== Research aircraft ====
[[File:ILA 2008 PD 423.JPG|thumb|ATTAS]]
[[File:SOFIA in air.jpg|thumb|SOFIA's maiden flight on 26 April 2007]]
DLR operates Europe’s largest fleet of research aircraft. The aircraft are used both as research objects and as research tools. DLR’s research aircraft provide platforms for all kinds of research missions. Scientists and engineers can use them for practical, application-oriented purposes: Earth observation, atmospheric research or testing new aircraft components. DLR is for instance investigating wing [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]] and possible ways of eliminating it, which would also help to reduce aircraft noise. So-called "flying simulators" can be used to simulate the flight performance of aircraft that have not been built yet. This method was for instance used to test the [[Airbus A380]] in the early stages of its development. The [[VFW-Fokker 614|VFW 614]] '''ATTAS''' was used to test several systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fuel-cell-mv2.dlr.de/fl/produkte/dl/experimental2.htm | title = Experimental Cockpit}}{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-altitude research aircraft HALO ([[High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft]]) will be used for atmospheric research and Earth observation from 2009. With a cruising altitude of more than 15 kilometers and a range of over 8,000 kilometers, HALO will provide for the first time the capability to gather data on a continental scale, at all latitudes, from the tropics to the poles, and at altitudes as high as the lower stratosphere.

The Airbus A320-232 ''D-ATRA'', the latest and largest addition to the fleet, has been in use by the German Aerospace Center since late 2008. ATRA ([[Advanced Technology Research Aircraft]]) is a modern and flexible flight test platform which sets a new benchmark for flying test beds in European aerospace research – and not just because of its size.

DLR and [[NASA]] jointly operate the flying infrared telescope SOFIA ([[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]]). A [[Boeing 747SP]] with a modified fuselage enabling it to carry a reflecting telescope developed in Germany is used as an airborne research platform. The aircraft is operated by the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] at Site 9 (USAF Plant 42) in Palmdale, California. Observation flights will be flown 3 or 4 nights a week, for up to eight hours at a time and at an altitude of 12 to 14 kilometers. SOFIA has been designed to remain operational for a period of 20 years. It is the successor to the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]] (KAO), which was deployed from 1974 to 1995.

==== Emissions research ====
DLR conducts research into {{CO2}} and noise emissions caused by air transport. In order to ensure that increasing traffic volumes do not lead to an increase in the noise pollution caused by air transport, DLR is investigating options for noise reduction. The "Low-noise Approach and Departure Procedures" research project (German: ''Lärmoptimierte An- und Abflugverfahren''), for instance, forms part of the national research project "Quiet Traffic" (German: ''Leiser Verkehr''). The objective of this project is to find flight procedures that can reduce the amount of noise generated during takeoff and landing. One approach is to analyse noise propagation at ground level during takeoff using a large number of microphones. Researchers are also trying to reduce the noise at source, focusing for instance on airframe and engine noise. They hope to minimise noise generated in the engines using so-called "[[Active noise control|antinoise]]".

The German Aerospace Center's research work on {{CO2}} emissions caused by air transport focuses for instance on model calculations concerning the effects of converting the global aircraft fleet to [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen propulsion]]. The growth rates of aviation are above average. This raises the question if {{CO2}} emission-free hydrogen propulsion could perhaps limit the effects of growing air traffic volumes on the environment and the climate.

==== Hydrogen as an energy carrier ====
The [[Hydrosol]] and [[Hydrosol-2]] is one of the energy research projects in which DLR scientists are engaged. For the first time, scientists have achieved thermal water splitting using solar energy, generating hydrogen and oxygen without {{CO2}} emissions. For this achievement, the DLR team and several other research groups received the [[Descartes Prize]], a research award created by the European Commission.  The FP6 Hydrosol II pilot reactor (around 100&amp;nbsp;kW) for solar [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] [[hydrogen production]] at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]] started in November 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP6_PROJ&amp;ACTION=D&amp;RCN=75098&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=1161712766968 | title = HYDROSOL II | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2009-11-03 | work = Sixth Framework Programme | publisher = [[CORDIS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is in operation since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/ | title = DLR scientists achieve solar hydrogen production in a 100-kilowatt pilot plant | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2008-11-25 | work = DLR Portal | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traffic Congestion====
[[File:Zeppelin nt dlr.jpg|thumb|[[Zeppelin NT]] carrying the DLR logo]]
During the 2006 FIFA World Cup football championship, DLR implemented the Soccer project aimed at preventing traffic congestion. In this transportation research project, traffic data was obtained from the air in Berlin, Stuttgart and Cologne and used as input for traffic forecasting. A sensor system combining a conventional and a thermographic camera was used to obtain the data. A zeppelin, an aeroplane and a helicopter served as flying research platforms. An image analysis software package generated aerial photos showing the current traffic parameters as well as traffic forecasts. In this way, traffic control centres could be provided with almost-real-time traffic information, and road users could be diverted whenever necessary.

==== Solar tower power plant ====
[[Image:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|thumb|The 11&amp;nbsp;MW [[PS10]] near Seville in Spain.]]
In 2007, the first commercially operated [[Solar power tower|solar tower power plant]], the [[PS10 solar power tower]], was commissioned. It has a capacity of eleven megawatt and it is located near Sevilla, in [[Sanlúcar la Mayor]] (Spain). DLR is prominently involved in developing the technology for this type of power plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/sectors/doc/csp/ps10_final_report.pdf Final technical progress report, for European Union officials (November 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811230017/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/sectors/doc/csp/ps10_final_report.pdf |date=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In solar tower power plants, sun-tracking mirrors (heliostats) redirect the solar radiation onto a central heat exchanger (receiver) on top of a tower. This generates high-temperature process heat, which can then be used in gas or steam turbine power plants to generate electrical power for the public electricity grid. In the future, solar thermal tower plant technology could also be used to generate solar fuels, such as hydrogen, without {{CO2}} emissions.

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden St Luke Some Chick MFA Boston.jpg|thumb|''Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin'', c. 1435–1440. 137.5 x 110.8cm. [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. This was the classic subject for paintings given to the guilds]]
The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

'''Homoeriodictyol''' is a [[bitter-masking]] [[flavanone]] extracted from Yerba Santa (''[[Eriodictyon californicum]]'') a plant growing in [[Americas|America]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Kaminski and Richard Katz.  [http://www.flowersociety.org/Yerba_About.htm Yerba Santa ''Eriodictyon californicum'']. Flower Essence Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homoeriodictyol (3`-methoxy-4`,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone) is one of the 4 flavanones identified by [[Symrise]] in this plant eliciting [[taste-modifying]] property: homoeriodictyol sodium salt, [[eriodictyol]] and [[sterubin]].  Homoeriodictyol Sodium salt elicited the most potent bitter-masking activity by reducing from 10 to 40% the bitterness of [[salicin]], [[amarogentin]], [[paracetamol]] and [[quinine]]. However no bitter-masking activity was detected with bitter [[linoleic acid]] emulsions. According to Symrise's scientists homoeriodictyol sodium salt seems to be a taste-modifier with large potential in [[food]] applications and [[pharmaceutical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ley JP, Krammer G, Reinders G, Gatfield IL, Bertram HJ |title=Evaluation of bitter masking flavanones from Herba Santa (''Eriodictyon californicum'' (H. and A.)

Structural relatives investigation based on eriodictyol and homoeriodictyol, found 2,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid vanillylamide to elicits bitter-masking activity. At 0.1g/L, this [[vanillin]] derivative, was able to reduce the bitterness of a 0.5g/L [[caffeine]] solution by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ley JP, Blings M, Paetz S, Krammer GE, Bertram HJ |title=New bitter-masking compounds: hydroxylated benzoic acid amides of aromatic amines as structural analogues of homoeriodictyol |journal=J.

'''''Human Traces''''' is a 2005 [[novel]] by [[Sebastian Faulks]], best known as the British author of ''[[Birdsong (novel)|Birdsong]]'' and ''[[Charlotte Gray (novel)|Charlotte Gray]]''. The novel took Faulks five years to write. It tells of two friends who set up a pioneering asylum in 19th-century Austria, in tandem with the evolution of psychiatry and the start of the [[First World War]].

==Plot overview==
Tracing the intertwined lives of Doctors Thomas Midwinter, who is English, and Jacques Rebière, from [[Brittany]], France, ''Human Traces'' explores the development of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] in the late 19th century, by way of excursions into first [[psychiatry|alienism]] then [[metaphysics]], [[human evolution]] and [[neuroscience]], before the search for what it means to be human takes us into a brief foray into the [[First World War]]. Central to the plot is the theory of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

Whilst some have criticised ''Human Traces'' as excessively [[expository]], detailed and [[didactic]], it has also been considered wide-ranging, ambitious and well written. It has enjoyed commercial success, having been a bestseller in the United Kingdom.

Faulks himself says of his novel:

'Human Traces was a [[Sisyphus|Sisyphean task]]. After spending five years in libraries reading up on madness, psychiatry and psychoanalysis (my office had charts and timelines and things plastered all over the walls), the act of finishing it felt like a bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21613136-5001986,00.html ''The Australian'', Books, 28 April 2007 'Parting with the art of war]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‘humanities’ as a  class or kind, distinct from the ’sciences’, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty’s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‘fuzziness’. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‘the humanities’ would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor’s degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24148">'''In-Situ Capping (ISC) of Subaqueous Waste''' is a non-removal [[environmental remediation|remediation]] technique for contaminated [[sediment]] that involves leaving the waste in place and isolating it from the environment by placing a layer of soil and/or material over the contaminated waste as to prevent further spread of the [[contaminant]]. In-situ capping provides a viable way to remediate an area that is contaminated. It is an option when [[Environmental remediation#Pump and treat|pump and treat]] becomes too expensive and the area surrounding the site is a low energy system. The design of the cap and the characterization of the surrounding areas are of equal importance and drive the feasibility of the entire project. Numerous successful cases exist and more will exist in the future as the technology expands and grows more popular.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt; In-situ capping uses techniques developed in [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[environmental geotechnical engineering]].
{{TOC right}}

==Introduction==
[[Contaminant]]s located in sediments still pose a risk to the environment and human health. Some of the direct effects on aquatic life that can be associated with contaminated sediment include “the development of cancerous tumors in fish exposed to [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s in sediments."&lt;ref name="Palermo"&gt;Palermo, M., Maynord, S., Miller, J., and Reible, D. 1998. "Guidance for [[In-Situ]] Subaqueous Capping of Contaminated Sediments," EPA 905-B96-004, Great Lakes National Program Office, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; These high-risk sediments need to be remediated. There are usually only four options for remediation:

#Nonremoval technologies&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
## Containment in-place (In-Situ Capping)
## Treatment in-place
#Removal technologies&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
## Removal and containment
## Removal and treatment

The cap can be made up of many different things, including but not limited to sand, gravel, [[geotextile]]s, and multiple layers of these options.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;

There are many ways that a contaminant inside sediment can become introduced to the environment. These ways include but are not limited to advection, diffusion, [[Benthos|benthic organisms]] mixing and reworking of the upper layer of the contaminated sediment, and sediment re-suspension by different subaquatic forces.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; In-situ capping (ISC) can fix all of these adverse effects with three primary functions:

# Isolation of the contaminated sediment from the benthic environment; this prevents the contaminant from spreading up the food chain.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt; This isolation of the contaminant is the most important factor in reducing exposure risks.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
# Prevention of resuspension and transport of the contaminant, referred to as stabilization of the sediments.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
# Reduction of the flux of dissolved contaminants into the water column, also known as chemical isolation.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"&gt;Reible, D. 2003. “In Situ Remediation Through Capping: Status and Research Needs,” Department of Civil Engineering, University of Texas. Austin, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth, although not necessary, function of an in-situ cap should be the "encouragement of habitat values." This should not be made a primary goal except in extreme circumstances. This can be achieved by altering the superficial characteristics of the cap to "encourage desirable species or discourage undesirable species."&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

The obvious advantage of using in-situ capping is that the waste will not be disturbed, and it prevents further contamination of the surrounding area from movement of the contaminant by removal. Sadly, the long-term effects of ISC have not been studied since it is an emerging technology.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

In-situ capping has been effective in numerous locations. For example, in several places in the interior of Japan “in-situ capping of nutrient-laden sediments with sand” has worked very well in preserving water quality by reducing “the release of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)” and oxygen depletion by bottom sediments.&lt;ref name="Zeman"&gt;Zeman, A. J., Sills, S., Graham, J. E., and Klein, K. A. 1992. Subaqueous Capping of Contaminated Sediments: Annotated Bibliography, NWRI Contribution No. 92-65, National Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site evaluation==

===Remedial objectives===
It is very important to evaluate the site and goals of a specific project to determine if ISC is the right technique to use. First, it is important to find out if ISC will satisfy all of the desired remedial objectives. To determine if ISC will satisfy the remedial objectives it is important to look at the three primary functions previously listed for ISC. For the first function it is important to realize that “the ability of an ISC to isolate aquatic organisms from the sediment contaminants is dependent upon” the deposition of new sediment contaminants being deposited on the cap. If contaminated sediment is deposited back on top of the cap then a cap was built to separate to contaminated layers. Thus, “ISC should only be considered if source control has been implemented."  Stabilization of the contaminated sediment could be a design function if the goal of remediation is to prevent negative environmental impacts due to “resuspension, transport and redeposition” of the contaminated sediments to other remote areas. Furthermore, if a remedial objective is desired, then the purpose of the ISC could be to isolate the contaminated soil from the surrounding environment, thus controlling the environment of the contaminated soil and causing possible degradation of the contaminate.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Criteria===
On site evaluation to see if ISC is a good remediation technique is based on several criteria: the surrounding physical environment, current and long-term hydrodynamic conditions, the geotechnical and geological conditions, hydrogeological conditions, on-site sediment characterization, and current and long-term waterway uses.&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;

Many of the physical properties of the surrounding area where the cap would be placed are important. Some things to consider when constructing a cap would be “waterway dimensions, water depths, tidal patterns, ice formations, aquatic vegetation, bridge crossings and proximity of lands or marine structures”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; It is best if the area surrounding the ISC is flat for ease of installation.

===Hydrodynamic conditions===
The hydrodynamic conditions are of equal importance. It is best if in-situ capping projects are performed in low-energy waterways such as harbors, low flow streams, or estuaries.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;Sharma, H., Reddy, K. 2004. ''Geo-Environmental Engineering'', Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies, pp 938–958.&lt;/ref&gt; High energy and high flow environments can affect the long-term stability of the cap and cause plausible erosion over time. Currents are also important. Currents vary along a water column and placement of the ISC can be negatively affected by changing currents. It is important to take into consideration the long-term impacts of episodic events such as tidal flow on bottom current velocities. Modeling must be done to determine if placement of the in-situ cap will alter existing hydrodynamic conditions.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Geotechnical and geological conditions===
A study of the geotechnical and geological conditions must be made before the placement of the in-situ cap because of potential settling underneath the cap. If settling is predicted to be significant, the cap design may have to be designed thicker than originally projected to allow the settling to not alter the integrity of the cap.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

Hydrogeological conditions are important to consider before placement. It is important to locate areas of discharge, which are areas where the groundwater flow path has an upward component.&lt;ref name="Freeze"&gt;Freeze, R.A. and Cherry, J.A. 1979; ''Groundwater''&lt;/ref&gt; This discharge can cause the in-situ cap to become displaced or cause containments to be transported to the surface water, thus causing decreased effectiveness of the in-situ cap.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Sediment characterization===
Typical sediment characterization is needed before construction and design of the ISC can be implemented. These tests on the sediments include: “visual classification, natural water content/solids concentrations, plasticity indices ([[Atterberg limits]]), [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) content, grain size distribution, [[specific gravity]], and Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Waterway uses===
It is important to realize what the current waterway uses are and how they may be affected with the placement of an in-situ cap. Some waterway uses that may be affected by the construction of an in-situ cap include but are not limited to “navigation, flood control, recreation, water supply, storm water or effluent discharge, waterfront development, and utility crossing." Since the construction of an in-situ cap may limit some of these activities due to the importance that the caps integrity be maintained over an extended period of time, any use that may cause displacement of the cap should be limited. Furthermore, the construction of an in-situ cap will cause a drop in water depth thus limiting the size of ships that may cross the area. These limitations on the waterway may also have social and economic impacts that must be considered.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Regulatory standards===
It is important to know all of the regulatory standards in place for the desired location of the ISC. All ISC must comply with the requirements in the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), although the ability of in-situ capping to meet those standards in the long term has not been successfully researched and studied enough due to lack of data.

==Cap design==
Cap design, which includes the composition and dimensions of the components, is probably the most important aspect of in-situ capping. The cap designs “must be compatible with available construction and placement techniques” along with meeting the three previously mentioned criteria above. The cap designs usually are over small areas with small volumes of contaminants. The cap is usually constructed with many layers of granular media, armor stone, and geotextiles. Presently, laboratory tests and models of the various processes involved (advection, diffusion, bioturbation, consolidation, erosion), limited field experience, and monitoring data drive cap design. Since data and field experience is limited a conservative approach is used when designing an in-situ cap. This approach uses the idea that the many different components are additive and no cap component provides a dual function, although a component may provide a dual function in actual practice.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===The six steps of cap design===
The six general steps for in-situ cap design, provided by Palermo et al. are listed below:&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

# Identify candidate capping materials and compatibility with contaminated sediment at the site.
# Assess the bioturbation potential of indigenous benthos and design a cap component to physically isolate sediment contaminants from the benthic environment.
# Evaluate potential erosion at the capping site due to currents, waves, propeller wash, and design a cap component to stabilize the contaminated sediments and other cap components.
# Evaluate the potential flux of sediment contaminants and design a cap component to reduce the flux of dissolved contaminants into the water column.
# Evaluate potential interactions and compatibility among cap components, including consolidation of compressible materials.
# Evaluate operational considerations and determine restrictions or additional protective measure needed to assure cap integrity.

===Selection of materials===
Identifying the materials should be assessed at the beginning of the project because they typically represent the largest cost to the project. Thus, if the materials needed cost too much the project may not be feasible at all.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;
Granular materials are used in most cases. These can include but are not limited to “quarry sand, naturally occurring sediments or soil materials”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Studies have shown that fine-grained materials and sandy materials can be effective in the construction of an in-situ cap.&lt;ref name=Brannon&gt;Brannon, J. M., Hoeppel, R. E., Sturgis, T. C., Smith, I., and Gunnison, D. 1985. “Effectiveness of Capping in Isolating Contaminated Dredged Material from Biota and the Overlying Water, “ Technical Report, D-85-10, US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, fine grain materials have been shown to act as better chemical barriers than sand caps.&lt;ref name="Suszkowski"&gt;Suszkowski, D. J. 1983. “Studies on Capping of Contaminated Dredged Material by the New York District Corps of Engineers.” In Proceedings of the 7th Annual US/Japan Experts Meeting, 134–145. US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station: Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a fine grain material is a better capping component than factory-washed sand.  It is important to have control the amount of organic material within the cap because the benthic organisms have shown interest in burrowing within any unconsolidated fine grained sediments containing organic matter.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Increased levels of organic matter in sands have shown an increase in the retardation of hydrophobic organic contaminants through the cap and encourage degradation of contaminant.&lt;ref name="Reible" /&gt; Thus a careful balance of organics is necessary.

===Geomembranes===
[[Geomembranes]] can serve numerous purposes in a cap design, including “provide a bioturbation barrier; stabilize the cap; reduce contaminant flux; prevent mixing of cap materials with underlying sediments; promote uniform consolidation, and; reduce erosion of capping materials”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Geomembranes have been used for stabilization in two projects along with granular media for the ISC constructed at [[Sheboygan River]] and in Eitrheim Bay, Norway.&lt;ref name="Instanes"&gt;Instanes. D. 1994. “Pollution Control of a Norwegian Fjord by Use of Geotextiles,” Fifth International Conference on Geotextiles, Geomembranes, and Related Products, Singapore, 5–9 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although geomembranes seem to have great benefits, the problem of uplift and ballooning has arisen and not much research has gone into assessing what causes the lift of the geomembranes off of the surface.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke et al 1993.'' Restoration and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs'', Second Edition, Lewis Publishers, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to determine the overall effectiveness of [[geosynthetics]] for chemical isolation.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Cap armoring===
[[Armoring stone]], which is any stone that is used to "shield" the rest of the in-situ cap, can be used for resistance to erosion and should be considered in cap design.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt; The long-term ability of the cap to perform depends primarily on its ability to withstand external forces, mostly hydraulic forces.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt; There are three basic approaches that may be used to have long-term cap stability:

#The cap layer needs to be armored sufficiently to hold up under the various hydraulic forces.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#Cap at a deeper layer since hydraulic forces typically decrease with decreasing depth.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#Try to control the hydraulic forces to limit their effect on the cap layer with breakwaters, dams, navigational controls, etc.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

===Bioturbation===
[[Bioturbation]] is defined as the disturbance and mixing of sediments by benthic organisms. Many aquatic organisms live on or in the bottom sediments and can greatly increase the “migration of sediment contaminants through the direct movement of sediment particles, increasing the surface area of sediments exposed to the water column, and as a food for [[epibenthic]] or [[pelagic]] organism grazing on the benthos." The depth of bioturbation in marine environments is greater than that in fresh water environments. To prevent and reduce the impact of bioturbation on the cap, the cap should be designed with a sacrificial layer, typically only a few centimeters thick (5–10&amp;nbsp;cm). This layer will be assumed to be completely mixed with the environment and should prevent benthic organism from descending further into the in-situ cap. The thickness of the sacrificial layer should be based on a study of the local organisms and their behavior in the surrounding sediment near the area of the cap construction, since some benthic organisms have been known to burrow at depths of 1m or more. The presence of armor stone has been known to limit the colonization by deep burrowing benthic creatures. Another method of preventing benthic organisms from destroying the integrity of the cap design is to pick a granular media that the local benthic organism find unattractive and are not known to readily colonize on that surface, thus limiting the chance a benthic organism will grown on the cap.

The consolidation of the in-situ cap must be considered, provided that the selected material for the cap “is fine-grained granular material." The consolidation of the underlying material should be taken into account due to “advection of pore water upward into the cap during consolidation."&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Erosional effects===
Erosion should be carefully considered. To determine the level of protection against erosion it is important to look at “the potential severity of the environmental impacts associated with cap erosion and potential dispersion of the sediment contaminants in an extreme event” (such as a 100-year event). An under-designed in-situ cap could be compromised by erosion resulting in the release of contaminants. An over-designed cap would result in extremely high costs.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

==Construction==
Since the construction of the cap will directly affect the ability of the in-situ cap to perform it is important to plan carefully. It is important to note that "many contaminated sediment sites exhibit exceedingly soft sediments that can be easily disturbed, may be dislocated or destabilized by uneven placement, and may have insufficient load bearing capacity to support some cap materials." &lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

There are two basic was to construct an in-situ cap:
#Land-based placement: this involves using equipment near the shore or working in narrow channels. The cap in constructed with standard construction equipment such as "backhoes, clamshells, dumped from trucks, and/or spread with bulldozers." The major limitation of this method is the reach of the equipment.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
#Pipeline or barge placement: this involves placing the in-situ cap with a barge or a pipeline. Using different types of equipment to place the cap components on the ocean bed or lake bed. This is typically the desired method when working in deep areas or offshore.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Monitoring==

===Five steps for a monitoring program===
Fredette et al. outlines five steps for the development of a physical/biological monitoring program for ISC projects:&lt;ref name="Fredette"&gt;Fredette, T.J., Nelson, D.A., Clausner, J.E., and Anders, F.J. 1990. “Guidelines for Physical and Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Dredged Material Disposal Sites,” Technical Report D-90-12, US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Designating site-specific monitoring objectives
# Identifying elements of the monitoring plan
# Predicting responses and developing testable hypotheses
# Designating sampling design and methods
# Designating management options

Thus it is important a monitoring program be put into place at the onset of construction. A short-term monitoring program should be used to monitor the in-situ cap during construction and immediately following construction. This monitoring program should include frequent testing so real-time data is provided to allow quick adjustments to the overall cap design. A long-term monitoring program should be established to provide data about the overall effectiveness of the cap design and to make sure the cap is meeting all of its required regulations and that the cap is not excessively eroded. This long-term monitoring need only be assessed on a yearly to bi-yearly basis unless a problem is discovered; then more frequent testing will be required.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

During monitoring, it is important to schedule routine maintenance. This may include placement of material equal to the predicted amount of material removed due to erosion.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

==Case studies==
Although ISC is a relatively new remediation procedure several groups have used it with great success.

===General Motors Superfund Site===
In [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]], at the [[General Motors]] [[Superfund site]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-contaminated soils were dredged repeatedly but some areas still had high levels of contaminant (&gt;10ppm). These areas were capped, an approximate area of {{convert|75000|sqft|m2}}, with a three-layer ISC composed of 6&amp;nbsp;inches of sand, 6&amp;nbsp;inches of gravel and 6&amp;nbsp;inches of armor stone.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Manistique River, Michigan===
In [[Manistique River]], [[Michigan]], PCB-contaminated sediments were capped with a 40mm thick plastic liner over an area of {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} with varying depths of up to 15&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Sheboygan River, Wisconsin===
In Sheboygan River, Wisconsin, PCB-contaminated sediments were capped with a sand layer and armor stone layer. This was done in shallow regions were direct placement was possible.&lt;ref name="Eleder"&gt;Eleder, B. 1992. Sheboygan River Capping/armoring Demonstration Project, Presented at a Workshop on Capping Contaminated Sediments, May 27–28, 1992, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marathon Battery Remediation Project===
In [[Cold Spring, New York]], in the [[Hudson River]], sediment was contaminated with cadmium and nickel from a battery manufacturing facility. A Geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and a 12-inch covering of sandy loam was planted on top of the contaminated area.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

In  [[Elkton, Maryland]], contaminated sediment was discovered with excess amounts of [[Volatile organic compound|volatile organic]] components and [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]]s, resulting is severe discharge. The cap system constructed over the contaminated waste involved a geotextile working mat, a GCL, a scrim-reinforced polypropylene liner, a geotextile cushion, and a gabion mat.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Future research==
There are four major areas of research that currently need to be assessed:

#"Research into the fate and transport behavior of specific contaminants that do not behave in the simple manner assumed in current cap evaluation approaches (e.g. mercury)" &lt;ref name ="Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into the fate processes associated with physical, chemical and biological gradients within a cap" &lt;ref name = "Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into the influence of transport processes facilitated by [[nonaqueous phase liquid]] ([[NAPL]]) or gas migration"&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into cap amendments that may encourage sequestration or degradation fate processes" &lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

{{Ivelchester and Langport Navigation map}}
The '''Ivelchester and Langport Navigation''' was a scheme to make the River Ivel (now called the [[River Yeo (South Somerset)|River Yeo]]) navigable from [[Langport]] to [[Ilchester]], in [[Somerset]], [[England]]. Work started in 1795, but the scheme was effectively bankrupt by 1797, and construction of the locks was never completed.

==History==
[[Ilchester]] was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Barracks|garrison town]], built at the point where the [[Fosse Way]] crossed the River Ivel, and there is evidence that the Romans built quays on the river. There are mentions of boats using the river in the 13th century, and in a survey carried out in 1632 by Gerard. However, the Ivel was never a large river, and when there was inadequate water to reach Ilchester, goods were unloaded at [[Pill Bridge]], which crossed the river {{convert|1.5|mi}} downstream from the town. All goods moving from that bridge to the town had to pay tolls to the Borough of Ilchester, which increased the price of coal to the inhabitants. Navigation was also hampered by the restrictive size of the medieval bridge arch at Langport. The Ivelchester and Langport Navigation was conceived as a way of ensuring that boats could always reach the Ilchester town wharfs, and therefore duty would not be paid on goods using Pill Bridge Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Following a meeting with representatives from the [[Dorset and Somerset Canal]], which was part of a grand scheme to link the Bristol Channel to the English Channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of local businessmen obtained an [[Act of Parliament]] on 22 June 1795, which made provision for improving the river between Ilchester and Bicknell Bridge, just to the south east of Langport, and then cutting through the town along the course of the Portlake Rhine, which was then a drain, and rejoining the River Parrett below Langport lock. The act allowed the proprietors to raise £6,000 by issuing shares, and a further £2,000 in loans, if required.&lt;ref name=priestley&gt;{{harvnb |Priestley |1831 |p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three quarters of the share capital had been promised before the act was obtained, and so work commenced immediately. The plans involved widening the Portlake Rhine, building a lock close to the Little Bow bridge, near the centre of the town, and making a cut to join the River Parrett again near Bicknell's Bridge, which would include two more locks. A further four locks were to be constructed between there and Ilchester. The engineer was a local man called Josiah Easton, and good progress was made in the first six months at the Langport end of the scheme, but costs were escalating, and by October 1796, the scheme was in difficulty. The £6,000 of share capital had all been spent, but little work had been done on removing shoals from the river towards Ilchester. In 1797, outstanding debts were cleared and the scheme was effectively abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Parrett Navigation Act===
Despite the scheme not being finished, some traffic continued to use the river. The Parrett Navigation Act, which was obtained in 1836, authorised improvements to the [[River Parrett]] below Langport, the construction of a [[Westport Canal|canal to Westport]], and the rebuilding of the Great Bow Bridge, to allow larger boats to travel beyond Langport. Normal canal tolls were charged for use of the canal, and there was a toll for trade passing under the rebuilt bridge,{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=13}} but some of the shareholders felt that boat users on the River Ivel should also be charged, since the water levels on the river had improved since the construction of the  Parrett Navigation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Nicholas Broadmead, who was a solicitor, and Philip Broadmead, both of whom were shareholders in the [[Parrett Navigation Company]], set about tracing and buying the 120 shares of the original Ivelchester and Langport Canal Company. Philip Broadmead obtained professional opinions on the legality of the proposed action, and produced a document outlining the expected returns on such a scheme. Some shares were obtained, and a meeting was held on 26 September 1843 at the Castle Inn in Ilchester, but the outcome is not known, as the plan faded away, and the planned resurrection of the company did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Little remains of the Navigation. The course of the Portlake Rhine and the channel from Bicknell's Bridge to Little Bow bridge can be made out in the landscape, but navigation on the Parrett as a whole has largely ceased because the locks have been replaced by sluices.

Research into the many possible relationships, intersections and tensions between language and gender is diverse. It crosses disciplinary boundaries, and, as a bare minimum, could be said to encompass work notionally housed within [[applied linguistics]], [[linguistic anthropology]], conversation analysis, cultural studies, feminist media studies, feminist psychology, gender studies, interactional sociolinguistics, linguistics, [[mediated stylistics]], [[sociolinguistics]] and media studies. In methodological terms, there is no single approach that could be said to 'hold the field'. Discursive, poststructural, ethnomethodological, ethnographic, phenomenological, positivist and experimental approaches can all be seen in action during the study of language and gender, producing and reproducing what [[Susan Speer]] has described as 'different, and often competing, theoretical and political assumptions about the way discourse, ideology and gender identity should be conceived and understood'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speer | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Speer | chapter = Introduction: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mp4oaHvYz74C&amp;pg=PA7 | editor-last1 = Speer | editor-first1 = Susan A. | editor-link1 = Susan Speer | title = Gender talk: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | pages = 7–8 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780415246446 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, research in this area can perhaps most usefully be divided into three main areas of study: first, there is a broad and sustained interest in the varieties of speech associated with a particular [[gender]]; second, there is a related interested in the social norms and conventions that (re)produce gendered language use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah |chapter= Language and culture | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC&amp;pg=PA350 | editor-last1 = Fasold | editor-first1 = Ralph W. | editor-last2 = Connor-Linton | editor-first2 = Jeff | title = An introduction to language and linguistics | pages = 343&amp;ndash;372 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780521612357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of speech]] (or [[sociolect]]) associated with a particular gender is sometimes called a '''genderlect'''); and third, there are studies that focus on the contextually specific and locally situated ways in which gender is constructed and operationalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attenborough | first = Frederick | author-link = Frederick T.

Prominent scholars include [[Deborah Tannen]], [[Penelope Eckert]], [[Janet Holmes (linguist)|Janet Holmes]], [[Mary Bucholtz]], [[Kira Hall]], [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]], and others. The 1995 edited volume ''Gender Articulated: Language and the Socially Constructed Self''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Hall | editor-first1 = Kira | editor-last2 = Bucholtz | editor-first2 = Mary | editor-link2 = Mary Bucholtz | title = Gender articulated: language and the socially constructed self | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781136045424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as a central text on language and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Holmes | editor-first1 = Janet | editor-last2 = Meyerhoff | editor-first2 = Miriam | editor-link1 = Janet Holmes | title = The handbook of language and gender | publisher = Blackwell Pub | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780631225027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
In 1975 [[Robin Lakoff]] identified a "women's register", which she argued served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = Robin | title = Language and woman's place: text and commentaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | origyear = 1975 | isbn = 9780195167573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakoff argued that women tend to use linguistic forms that reflect and reinforce a subordinate role. These include [[tag question]]s, [[High rising terminal|question intonation]], and "weak" [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|directives]], among others (see also [[#Speech practices associated with gender|Speech practices associated with gender]], below).&lt;ref name=Wolfram&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Wolfram | editor-first1 = Walt | editor-last2 = Schilling-Estes | editor-first2 = Natalie | title = American English: dialects and variation | publisher = Blackwell Pub. | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781405112666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies such as Lakoff's have been labeled the "deficit approach", since they posit that one gender is deficient in terms of the other. Descriptions of women's speech as deficient can actually be dated as far back as [[Otto Jespersen|Otto Jespersen's]] "The Woman", a chapter in his 1922 book ''Language: Its Nature and Development, and Origin.''&lt;ref name="Jespersen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jespersen | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Jespersen | chapter = The woman | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6jtXmwEACAAJ | title = Language: its nature, development, and origin | publisher = Hamlin Press | location = | origyear = 1922 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781473302310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jespersen's idea that women's speech is deficient relative to a male norm went largely unchallenged until Lakoff's work appeared fifty years later.&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt;  Nevertheless, despite the political incorrectness of the chapter's language from a modern perspective, Jespersen's contributions remain relevant.  These include the prospect of language change based on social and gendered opportunity, lexical and phonological differences, and the idea of genderlects and gender roles influence language.

Not long after the publication of ''Language and Woman's Place'', other scholars began to produce studies that both challenged Lakoff's arguments and expanded the field of language and gender studies.&lt;ref name=Bucholtz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt; One refinement of the deficit argument is the so-called "dominance approach", which posits that gender differences in language reflect power differences in society.&lt;ref name="OBarr"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William | last2 = Atkins | first2 = Bowman | chapter = 'Women's language' or 'powerless language' | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KpM_AAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Borker | editor-first1 = Ruth | editor-last2 = Furman | editor-first2 = Nelly | editor-last3 = MacConnel-Ginet | editor-first3 = Sally | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = 93&amp;ndash;110 | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780030578939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Coates outlines the historical range of approaches to gendered speech in her book ''Women, Men and Language''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language: a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZU1ACwAAQBAJ  | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781317292531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She contrasts the four approaches known as the deficit, dominance, difference, and dynamic approaches.

''Deficit'' is an approach attributed to Jespersen that defines adult male language as the standard, and women's language as deficient.&lt;ref name="Jespersen" /&gt;  This approach created a dichotomy between women's language and men's language.  This triggered criticism to the approach in that highlighting issues in women's language by using men's as a benchmark.  As such, women's language was considered to have something inherently 'wrong' with it.

''Dominance'' is an approach whereby the female sex is seen as the subordinate group whose difference in style of speech results from male supremacy and also possibly an effect of patriarchy. This results in a primarily male-centered language. Scholars such as Dale Spender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spender | first = Dale | title = Man made language | publisher = New York University Press | location = London New York New York | year = 1998 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780863584015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Don Zimmerman and Candace West&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Small insults: a study of interruptions in conversations between unacquainted persons | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xiliAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = Kramarae | editor-first2 = Cheris | editor-last3 = Main Henley | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Language, gender, and society | pages = 102&amp;ndash;117 | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780883772683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subscribe to this view.

''Difference'' is an approach of equality, differentiating men and women as belonging to different 'sub-cultures' as they have been socialised to do so since childhood. This then results in the varying communicative styles of men and women. Deborah Tannen is a major advocate of this position.&lt;ref name=YJDU&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = You just don't understand: women and men in conversation | publisher = Morrow | location = New York, NY | year = 1990 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evwRw4SkF8MC | isbn = 9780060959623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tannen compares gender differences in language to cultural differences. Comparing conversational goals, she argues that men tend to use a "report style", aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women more often use a "rapport style", which is more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

The "dynamic" or "[[social constructionist]]" approach is, as Coates describes, the most current approach to language and gender.  Instead of speech falling into a natural gendered category, the dynamic nature and multiple factors of an interaction help a socially appropriate gendered construct.  As such, West and Zimmerman describe these constructs as "[[doing gender]]" instead of the speech itself necessarily being classified in a particular category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that these social constructs, while affiliated with particular genders, can be utilized by speakers as they see fit.

Scholars including Tannen and others argue that differences are pervasive across media, including face-to-face conversation,&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitzpatrick | first1 = Mary Anne | last2 = Mulac | first2 = Anthony | last3 = Dindia | first3 = Kathryn | title = Gender-preferential language use in spouse and stranger interaction | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927x95141002 | date = March 1995 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x95141002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HannahMurachver&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hannah | first1 = Annette | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Gender and conversational style as predictors of conversational behavior | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153&amp;ndash;174 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | date = June 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; written essays of primary school children,&lt;ref name="Mulac"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Studley | first2 = Lisa B.  | last3 = Blau | first3 = Sheridan | title = The gender-linked language effect in primary and secondary students' impromptu essays | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 23 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 439&amp;ndash;470 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/bf00289762 | date = November 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00289762 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; email,&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Predicting gender from electronic discourse | journal = [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 193&amp;ndash;208 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1348/014466601164812 | date = June 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1348/014466601164812 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even toilet graffiti.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Green | first = James A. | title = The writing on the stall: gender and graffiti | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 282&amp;ndash;296 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927X03255380 | date = September 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X03255380 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Cameron, among other scholars, argues that there are problems with both the dominance and the difference approach. Cameron notes that throughout the history of scholarship on language and gender male-associated forms have been seen as the [[Markedness|unmarked norm]] from which the female deviates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Verbal hygiene | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9786613954404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the norm 'manager' becomes the marked form 'manageress' when referring to a female counterpart. On the other hand, Cameron argues that what the difference approach labels as different ways of using or understanding language are actually displays of differential power. Cameron suggests, "It is comforting to be told that nobody needs to 'feel awful': that there are no real conflicts, only misunderstandings. ... But the research evidence does not support the claims made by Tannen and others about the nature, the causes, and the prevalence of male-female miscommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = The myth of Mars and Venus: do men and women really speak different languages | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780199214471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that social differences between men's and women's roles are not clearly reflected in language use. One additional example is a study she has done on call center operators in the UK, where these operators are trained to be scripted in what they say and to perform the necessary '[[emotional labor]]' (smiling, expressive intonation, showing rapport/empathy and giving minimal responses) for their customer-callers. This emotional labor is commonly associated with the feminine domain, and the call center service workers are also typically females. However, the male workers in this call center do not orient to the covertly gendered meanings when they are tasked to perform this emotional labor. While this does not mean that the 'woman's language' is revalued, nor does this necessarily call for a feminist celebration, Cameron highlights that it is possible that with time, more men may work in this service industry, and this may lead to a subsequent "de-gendering" of this linguistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Styling the worker: gender and the commodification of language in the globalized service economy | journal = [[Journal of Sociolinguistics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | date = August 2000 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/CAMERON_Styling_the_Worker.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication styles are always a product of context, and as such, gender differences tend to be most pronounced in single-gender groups. One explanation for this, is that people [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person. That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | last3 = Green | first3 = James | title = Where Is the gender in gendered language?  | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;175 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | date = March 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ochs argues that gender can be indexed directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ochs | first = Elinor | chapter = Indexing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jh59S6WIS98C&amp;pg=PA338 | editor-last1 = Duranti | editor-first1 = Alessandro | editor-last2 = Goodwin | editor-first2 = Charles | title = Rethinking context : language as an interactive phenomenon | pages = 335&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780521422888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct indexicality is the primary relationship between linguistics resources (such as lexicon, morphology, syntax, phonology, dialect and language) and gender. For example, the pronouns "he" and "she" directly indexes "male" and "female". However, there can be a secondary relationship between linguistic resources and gender where the linguistic resources can index certain acts, activities or stances which then indirectly index gender. In other words, these linguistic resources help constitute gender. Examples include the Japanese particles "wa" and "ze". The former directly index delicate intensity, which then indirectly indexes the female "voice" while the latter directly indexes coarse intensity, which then indirectly indexes the male "voice".

Women are generally believed to speak a better "language" than men do. This is a constant misconception, but scholars believe that no gender speaks a better language, but that each gender instead speaks its own unique language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Azizi | first = Masoud | chapter = Language and gender: Do women speak a better language? | chapterurl = https://www.academia.edu/4007491/Azizi_M._2011_._Language_and_gender_Do_women_speak_a_better_language_In_A._Shafaei_Ed._Frontiers_of_Language_and_Teaching_Vol._2_Proceedings_of_the_2011_International_Online_Language_Conference_pp._90-93_._Boca_Raton_Universal-Publishers | editor-last = Shafaei | editor-first = A. | title = Frontiers of language and teaching (Vol. 2): Proceedings of the 2011 International Online Language Conference (IOLC 2011) | pages = 90&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = Universal Publishers, BrownWalker Press | location = Boca Raton, Florida | year = 2011 | oclc = 794001605}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has sparked further research into the study of the differences between the way men and women communicate.

=== Children's television ===
A specific area of study within the field of language and gender is the way in which it affects [[Children's television series|''children's television'']]. Mulac et al.'s "''Male/Female Language Differences and Attributional Consequences in Children's Television''" focuses on identifying differing speech patterns of male versus female characters in popular children's television programs at the time (the 1980s).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Bradac | first2 = James J. | last3 = Karol Mann | first3 = Susan | title = Male/female language differences and attributional consequences in children's television | journal = [[Human Communication Research]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 481&amp;ndash;506 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00057.x | date = June 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00057.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data gathered by Mulac et al. comes from a two-week period in 1982 from three [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] daytime programs and three categories from [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial network programs]] (action, comedy/adventure, and commercials) that aired on Saturdays. They analyzed randomly selected interactive dialogue taken once from every ten minutes of their tapes. Mulac et al. collected data for 37 language variables, from which they determined the thirteen that showed significant differences between usage by male and female characters. Mulac et al.'s definitions of these thirteen features are as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Vocalized Pauses
|Utterance without semantic meaning (uh, um, etc.)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

|}

The following tended to be higher in frequency for males: vocalized pauses, action verbs, present tense verbs, justifiers, subordinating conjunctions, and grammatical "errors". On the other hand, the following were found to occur more for females: total verbs, uncertainty verbs, adverbials beginning sentences, judgmental adjectives, concrete nouns, and polite forms. In addition, female characters had longer sentences on average.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another facet of Mulac et al.'s research was to gather participants' subjective ratings on characters' socio-intellectual status (high/low social status, white/blue collar, literate/illiterate, rich/poor), dynamism (aggressive/unaggressive, strong/weak, loud/soft, active/passive), and aesthetic quality (pleasing/displeasing, sweet/sour, nice/awful, beautiful/ugly), based on the transcripts from the shows' dialogue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aubrey's 2004 study "''The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions''" identifies gender stereotypes in children’s television programs and evaluates the effects of these stereotypes on children’s personal [[Gender role|gender-role]] values and interpersonal attraction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aubrey | first1 = Jennifer Stevens | last2 = Harrison | first2 = Kristen | title = The gender-role content of children's favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions | journal = Media Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 111&amp;ndash;146 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey chose shows for the study based on children’s responses when asked to name their favorite television program (the top-named show was [[Rugrats]], followed by [[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]). Some of the stereotypes found in the study pertain to language/communication, but most are stereotypes or attributes of the characters such as assertiveness, aggression, emotionality, and cattiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In regards to language, the study found that male characters were more likely to ask questions, assert opinions, and direct others than female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female characters, on the other hand, were more likely to "receive or make comments about body or beauty" than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In general, Aubrey found less stereotypical content for female characters than for male, which they recognize to be a possible effect of either the higher presence of male characters or the difficulty of measuring [[Passivity (behavior)|passivity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Speech practices associated with gender ==
Not all members of a particular sex may follow the specific gender roles that are prescribed by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = Gender and discourse | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780195101249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns in gender and communication that follow are only the norms for each gender, and not every member of the corresponding sex may fit into those patterns.

===Minimal responses===
One of the ways in which the communicative behaviors of men and women differ is in their use of minimal responses, i.e., [[paralinguistic]] features such as 'mm' and 'yeah', which is behaviour associated with collaborative language use.&lt;ref name="Carli"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carli | first = Linda L. | title = Gender, language, and influence | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 941&amp;ndash;951 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941 | date = November 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men generally use them less frequently than women, and when they do, it is usually to show agreement, as Don Zimmerman and Candace West's study of [[turn-taking]] in conversation indicates.&lt;ref name="ZimmWest"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = Don H. | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Sex roles, interruptions and silences in conversation | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VgjUyTDftkwC | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = West | editor-first2 = Candace | title = Language and sex: difference and dominance | pages = 105&amp;ndash;129 | publisher = Newbury House Publishers | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780883770436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above can be true in some contexts and situations, studies that dichotomize the communicative behavior of men and women may run the risk of over-generalization. For example, "minimal responses appearing "throughout streams of talk", such as "mm" or "yeah", may only function to display active listening and interest and are not always signs of "support work", as Fishman claims. They can—as more detailed analysis of minimal responses show—signal understanding, demonstrate agreement, indicate scepticism or a critical attitude, demand clarification or show surprise.&lt;ref name="Fishman, Pamela 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interaction: The work women do | journal = [[Social Problems]] | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 387&amp;ndash;400 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/800091 | jstor = 800091 | date = February 1977 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/800091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, both male and female participants in a conversation can employ these minimal responses for interactive functions, rather than gender-specific functions.

===Questions===
Men and women differ in their use of questions in conversations. For men, a question is usually a genuine request for information whereas with women it can often be a rhetorical means of engaging the other's conversational contribution or of acquiring attention from others conversationally involved, techniques associated with a collaborative approach to language use.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barnes | first = Douglas | title = Language and learning in the classroom | journal = Journal of Curriculum Studies | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 27&amp;ndash;38 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0022027710030104  | date = 1971 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0022027710030104  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women use questions more frequently.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Alexandra Dundas | chapter = A diagnosis of doctor-patient discourse in the prescription of contraception | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qt4oBnGYmNcC&amp;pg=PA183 | editor-last1 = Fisher | editor-first1 = Sue | editor-last2 = Todd | editor-first2 = Alexandra Dundas | title = The social organization of doctor-patient communication | pages = 183&amp;ndash;212 | publisher = Ablex Pub. Corp | location = Norwood, New Jersey | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780893916992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study carried out by Alice Freed and Alice Greenwood in 1996 showed that there was no significant difference in the use of questions between genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freed | first1 = Alice F. | last2 = Greenwood | first2 = Alice | title = Women, men, and type of talk: What makes the difference? | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500020418 | date = March 1996 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500020418 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing, however, both genders use rhetorical questions as literary devices. For example, Mark Twain used them in "[[The War Prayer]]" to provoke the reader to question his actions and beliefs. Tag questions are frequently used to verify or confirm information, though in women's language they may also be used to avoid making strong statements.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"/&gt;

===Turn-taking===
As the work of Victoria DeFrancisco shows, female linguistic behaviour characteristically encompasses a desire to take turns in conversation with others, which is opposed to men's tendency towards centering on their own point or remaining silent when presented with such implicit offers of conversational turn-taking as are provided by [[hedge (linguistics)|hedge]]s such as "y' know" and "isn't it".&lt;ref name="DeFrancisco"&gt;{{cite journal | last = DeFrancisco | first = Victoria Leto | title = The sounds of silence: how men silence women in marital relations | journal = [[Discourse &amp; Society]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 413&amp;ndash;423 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0957926591002004003 | date = October 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0957926591002004003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire for turn-taking gives rise to complex forms of interaction in relation to the more regimented form of turn-taking commonly exhibited by men.&lt;ref name="SSJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sacks | first1 = Harvey | last2 = Schegloff | first2 = Emanuel A. | last3 = Jefferson | first3 = Gail | title = A simple systematics for the organization of turn-taking for conversation | journal = [[Language (journal)|Language]] | volume = 50 | issue = 4 (part 1) | pages = 696&amp;ndash;735 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/lan.1974.0010 | jstor = 412243 | date = December 1974 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.1974.0010 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing the topic of conversation===
According to Bruce Dorval in his study of same-sex friend interaction, males tend to change subject more frequently than females.&lt;ref name="Dorval"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Dorval | editor-first = Bruce | title = Conversational organization and its development | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZYsoAAAAYAAJ | volume = Volume XXXVIII | publisher = Ablex | location = Norwood, New Jersey | year = 1990 | series = Advances in Discourse Processes | isbn = 9780893916633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference may well be at the root of the conception that women chatter and talk too much. Goodwin observes that girls and women link their utterances to previous speakers and develop each other's topics, rather than introducing new topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goodwin | first = Majorie Harness | title = He-said-she-said: talk as social organization among Black children | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ESDkGWmjNiIC | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780253206183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study of young American couples and their interactions reveal that while women raise twice as many topics as men, it is the men's topics that are usually taken up and subsequently elaborated in the conversation.&lt;ref name="Fishman, Pamela 1978"/&gt;

===Self-disclosure===
{{Refimprove section |date=November 2011}}
Female tendencies toward [[self-disclosure]], i.e., sharing their problems and experiences with others, often to offer sympathy,&lt;ref name="Dindia"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dindia | first1 = Kathryn | last2 = Allen | first2 = Mike | title = Sex differences in disclosure: A meta-analysis | journal = [[Psychological Bulletin]] | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 106&amp;ndash;124 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.106 | date = July 1992 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.106 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts with male tendencies to non-self disclosure and professing advice or offering a solution when confronted with another's problems.&lt;ref name=YJDU/&gt;

Self-disclosure is not simply providing information to another person. Instead, scholars define self-disclosure as sharing information with others that they would not normally know or discover. Self-disclosure involves risk and vulnerability on the part of the person sharing the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Borchers |first=Tim |title=Interpersonal communication: self-disclosure | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=1999 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120720092451/http://www.abacon.com/commstudies/interpersonal/indisclosure.html | archive-date = 20 July 2012 |url=http://www.abacon.com/commstudies/interpersonal/indisclosure.html |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to genderlect, self-disclosure is important because genderlect is defined as the differences in male and female communication. Men and women have completely different views of self-disclosure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Developing a close relationship with another person requires a certain level of intimacy, or self-disclosure. It typically is much easier to get to know a woman than it is to get to know a man.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It has been proven{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that women get to know someone on a more personal level and they are more likely to desire to share their feelings.

It has also been said{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that people share more via technology. The phenomenon is known as [[Computer-mediated communication|Computer Mediated Communication]], also known as CMC.  This form of communication typically involves text only messages that tend to lose their nonverbal cues.  Men and women are both more likely to self-disclose on the computer than they would be face to face.  People are more confident when using Computer Mediated Communication because communication is faceless, which makes it easier to divulge information.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Research has been conducted to examine whether self-disclosure in adult friendship differs according to gender and marital status. Sixty-seven women and fifty-three men were asked about intimate and non-intimate self-disclosure to closest same-sex friends. Disclosure to spouse among married respondents was also assessed. The intimate disclosure of married men to friends was lower than that of unmarried men, married women and unmarried women; the intimate disclosure of these last three groups was similar. Married people's non-intimate disclosure to friends was lower than that of unmarried people, regardless of gender. Married people's intimate disclosure to their spouses was high regardless of gender; in comparison, married men's intimate disclosure to their friends was low, while married women's disclosure to their friends was moderate or even as high as disclosure to their spouses. The results suggest that sex roles are not the only determinant of gender differences in disclosure to friends. Marital status appears to have an important influence on disclosure in friendship for men but not for women. It was concluded that research on gender differences in self-disclosure and friendship has neglected an important variable, that of marital status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Derlega | first1 = Valerian J. | last2 = Metts | first2 = Sandra | last3 = Petronio | first3 = Sandra  | last4 = Margulis | first4 = Stephen T.  | title = Self-disclosure | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Newbury Park | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7m6QgAACAAJ | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780803939554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research goes to show that when a man is married he is less likely to have intimate self-disclosure. This could be because a man may feel he is betraying his wife's confidence by disclosing information that might be considered private. However, the research also showed that the married women didn't change much in either situation, because women tend to self disclose more than men.

Men tend to communicate differently with other men than they do with other women, while women tend to communicate the same with both men and women. "Male and female American students who differed in masculinity and in femininity self-disclosed to a same-sex stranger in contexts that made either social/expressive motives or instrumental motives salient. The results were consistent with the primary assertion that measures of sex role identity are better predictors of contextual variations in self-disclosure than is sex per se. Sex consistently failed to predict subjects' willingness to self-disclose, both within and across contexts, whereas femininity promoted self-disclosure in the context that was clearly social and expressive in character. Although masculinity failed to exert the expected facilitative impact on self-disclosure within the instrumental context, it nonetheless influenced the results; androgynous subjects, who scored high in both masculinity and femininity, were more self-revealing across contexts than was any other group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashida | first1 = Sato | last2 = Koehly | first2 = Laura M. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = J.

Displaying strictly feminine or masculine traits will not be to one's advantage in communication, because it is important to be able to recognize and utilize these traits to be an effective communicator.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From a social skills perspective, gender, tunic, and cultural differences in relationships may stem, in part, from differences in communication. The influence of biological sex on communication values has received scholarly attention. In general, women value affectively oriented communication skills more than men, and men value instrumentally oriented communication skills more than women, although the effect size for these differences are generally small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Anuradha | first = M. | title = Gender stereotyping in television commercials aimed at children in India | journal = Media Asia | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 209&amp;ndash;215 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | date = 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-disclosure is also very important when it comes to a close dating relationship between men and women. Successful communication in relationships is one of the greatest difficulties most couples are forced to overcome. Men in relationships with women may practice self-disclosure more often than their female partner. Self-disclosure is considered to be a key factor in facilitating intimacy. For example, American heterosexual couples were studied using various measures twice a year. By using the average scores of both partners, they found that self-disclosure was higher in those couples who remained together at the second administration of the surveys than in those who broke up between two administrations. Similarly, researchers asked heterosexual couples who had just begun dating to complete a self-disclosure measure and to answer the same questionnaire four months later. They found that couples who were still dating four months later reported greater self-disclosure at the initial contact than did those who later broke up. This test shows self-disclosure can be beneficial to facilitating a positive relationship. Self-disclosure is a process which typically begins rapidly, but then plateaus as the couple gains more information.  The initial self-disclosure is extremely important when first meeting someone. The first interactions between a potential couple could be deciding factors in the success or failure of the relationship.

Self-disclosure is difficult because not all women and men communicate the same.

===Verbal aggression===
Aggression can be defined by its three intersecting counterparts: indirect, relational and social. Indirect aggression occurs when the victim is attacked through covert and concealed attempts to cause social suffering. Examples are gossiping, exclusion or ignoring of the victim. Relational aggression, while similar to indirect, is more resolute in its attentions. It can be a threat to terminate a friendship or spreading false rumors. The third type of aggression, social aggression, "is directed toward damaging another's self-esteem, social status, or both, and may take direct forms such as verbal rejection, negative facial expressions or body movements, or more indirect forms such as slanderous rumors or social exclusion."&lt;ref name="Blake, J.

Dr. M.K. Underwood, leading researcher in child clinical psychology and developmental psychology, began using the term social aggression in several of her experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Underwood | first = M.K. | title = Speech {{!}} Keynote Speaker | url = http://www.collin.edu/conference/studentresearch/keynote.html | publisher = Collin College Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Student Research Conference  | date = 2011 | access-date = 1 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, Underwood followed 250 third-graders and their families in order to understand how anger is communicated in relationships, especially in face-to-face and behind-the-back situations. It was found that technology and electronic communication has become a key factor in social aggression. This discovery has been termed [[cyber-bullying]]. In another experiment, social aggression was used to see if verbal and nonverbal behaviors contributed to a person's social value.&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"/&gt; It was found that those who communicated nonverbal signals were seen as angry and annoyed by their peers. In a third study, the experimenters determined that while socially aggressive students were vastly disliked, they were alleged to be the popular kids and had the highest marked social status. Most research has been based on teacher assessments, case studies and surveys.

For years, all research on aggression focused primarily on males because it was believed females were non-confrontational. Recently however, people have realized that while "boys tend to be more overtly and physically aggressive, girls are more indirectly, socially, and relationally aggressive."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; In a study done measuring cartoon character's aggressive acts on television, these statistics were found:&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luther | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Legg Jr. | first2 = J.

* 76.9% of physical aggression was committed by male characters
* 23.1% of physical aggression was committed by female characters
* 37.2% of social aggression was committed by male characters
* 62.8% of social aggression was committed by female characters

Physical and social aggression emerge at different points in life. Physical aggression occurs in a person's second year and continues till preschool. Toddlers use this aggression to obtain something they want that is otherwise denied or another has. In preschool, children become more socially aggressive and this progresses through adolescence and adulthood. Social aggression is not used to acquire materialistic things but to accomplish social goals.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = Lisa H. | last2 = Underwood | first2 = Marion K. | last3 = Beron | first3 = Kurt J. | title = Peer victimization as a mediator of the relation between facial attractiveness and internalizing problems | journal = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 319&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[Wayne State University Press]] | jstor = 23098049 | doi = 10.1353/mpq.2011.0016 | date = July 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/mpq.2011.0016 | ref = harv | postscript = .| pmc = 3186210 }} [https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol57/iss3/6/ Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in first grade, research has shown that young females are more disliked when they are socially aggressive than when young males are physically aggressive. However, until the fourth grade there is an overall negative correlation between aggression and popularity.&lt;ref name="Garandeau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garandeau | first1 = Claire F. | last2 = Ahn | first2 = Hai-Jeong | last3 = Rodkin | first3 = Philip C. | title = The social status of aggressive students across contexts: The role of classroom status hierarchy, academicachievement, and grade | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1699&amp;ndash;1710 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0025271 | date = November 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025271 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of fifth grade, aggressive children, both male and female, are more popular than their non-aggressive counterparts.  This popularity does not insinuate likeability.

In the seventh grade, social aggression seems to be at its peak. When eight-, eleven- and fifteen-year-olds were compared, there were high reports of social aggression but no apparent statistical differences between the age groups.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt;

Several studies have shown that social aggression and high academic performance are incompatible. In classrooms with a high achievement record, researchers were less likely to find social aggression. Vice versa can be found for classrooms with a low achievement record.&lt;ref name="Garandeau" /&gt;

In adolescence, social aggression boosts female's popularity by maintaining and controlling the social hierarchy. Furthermore, males are also ranked higher in popularity if they are physically aggressive. But, if males practice relational or social aggression then they are seen as unpopular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"/&gt; When it comes to different forms social aggression, males are more prone to use direct measures and females indirect.

In addition to gender, the conditions in which a child grows up in also affects the likelihood of aggression.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt; Children raised in a divorced, never married or low-income family are more likely to show social aggression. This is speculated because of the higher rates of conflict and fighting already in the household. Parents who use an aversive style of parenting can also contribute to the social aggression in their children.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt; Researchers venture that "perhaps children who are treated harshly by parents have a higher baseline level of anger…and may lack the opportunities to practice more direct, assertive strategies for conflict resolution so may be prone to maligning others or lashing out when they are angry."&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt;

Through the last couple decades, the media has increased its influence over America's youth. In a study done measuring the aggressive acts committed by cartoon characters on television, out of 8927 minutes of programming time 7856 aggressive acts took place. This is roughly .88 aggressive acts per minute.&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; Because television and cartoons are one of the main mediums for entertainment, these statistics can be troubling. If children relate to the characters, then they are more likely to commit similar acts of aggression. For teenagers, popular films and series such as ''[[Mean Girls]]'' (2004), ''[[Easy A]]'' (2010) and ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' (2007) have shown an exaggerated, damaging view of how society works. Already, latest studies have shown an increase of social aggression in girls. Other experiments, such as one done by  [[Albert Bandura]], the [[Bobo doll experiment]], have shown similar results of society shaping your behavior because of the impact of a model.

The development of social aggression can be explained by the social identity theory and evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

The social identity theory categorizes people into two groups, in-groups and out-groups. You see yourself as part of the in-group and people who are dissimilar to you as part of the out-group. In middle and high school these groups are known as cliques and can have several names. In the popular 2004 teen drama ''Mean Girls'', "varsity jocks", "desperate wannabes", "over-sexed band geeks", "girls who eat their feelings", "cool Asians" and "the Plastics" were several cliques from the movie.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Two common middle and high school cliques seen in everyday life are the popular crowd, in-group, and everyone else, out-group. The out-group has several other divisions but for the most part the in-group will categorize the out-groups all as one.

Around this time, it becomes important for a females social identity to be associated with the in-group. When a girl possess qualities that are valued in the in-group, then her social identity will increase. However, if her characteristics resemble those of the out-group, then she will be attack the out-group in order to keep her social standing within the in-group. This intergroup struggle, also known as social competition, mostly comes the in-group condemning the out-group, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

Moreover, social aggression can lead to intragroup competition. Inside the social groups there is also a hierarchal ranking, there are followers and there are leaders. When one's position in the group does not lead to positive self-identity, then the group members will feud with one another to increase status and power within the clique. Studies show that the closer a female is to her attacker, the less likely she is to forgive.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

Where the social identity theory explains direct social aggression, research done in the evolutionary perspective explains indirect social aggression. This aggression stemmed from "successful competition for scarce resources… and enables optimal growth and development."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Two tactics used are the coercive and prosocial strategies. The coercive strategies involve controlling and regulating all resources of the out-group through a monopoly. For this scheme, one must rely heavily on threats and aggression. The other strategy, prosocial, involves helping and sharing resources. This method shows complete dominance for the in-group, because in order for others to survive they must subordinate themselves to receive resources. Ability to control resources effectively results in higher-ranking in the in-group, popular crowd.

Social aggression can be detrimental for both ends of the spectrum, the out-group and in-group members. Longitudinal studies prove that aggression can lead to victims feeling lonely and socially isolated. In addition, targets report feeling depressed and affected by other health risks such as headaches, sleepiness, abdominal pain and bedwetting.&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; The aggressors on the other hand, were suggested to "encounter future problems in social relationships or emotional difficulties during early childhood."&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; In academics, victims were reported to having below average test scores and low achievement.

Studies that measure cross-gender differences show that females find social aggression to be more hurtful than males do. The results of the hurt and pain felt by female victims can be seen in all ages.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Pre-school teachers have reported several cases of female students feeling depressed. In high school, the female victims begin to slowly isolate themselves. A year later, this seclusion has led to social phobia. Furthermore, in college, pressure and aggression from Greek life has lowered life satisfaction and increased antisocial behavior in several female students.

While social aggression has several downfalls, it has also led to a mature social competence of males and females. Being part of an in-group can increase a person's self-worth and contribute to his or her personal identity. In terms of the evolutionary perspective, being able to control definite and indefinite resources can increase a person's social competence.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Some research argues that reports of social aggression and bullying can teach students in school what is considered unacceptable behavior. In a 1998 survey, 60% of students found that bullying "makes kids tougher."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; However, there is additional need for support on this claim.

Since 1992, there have been nine school intervention and prevention programs, which have met the rigorous criteria of efficacy, to avert social aggression.&lt;ref name="Leff, S. R. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leff | first1 = Stephen S. | last2 = Waasdorp | first2 = Tracy Evian | last3 = Crick | first3 = Nicki R. | title = A review of existing relational aggression programs: strengths, limitations, and future directions | journal = [[School Psychology Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 508&amp;ndash;535 | publisher = [[National Association of School Psychologists|NASP]] | pmc = 3111222 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/spr/volume-39/volume-39-issue-4/a-review-of-existing-relational-aggression-programs-strengths-limitations-and-future-directions | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=21666876}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs include Early Childhood Friendship Project (2009), You Can't Say You Can't Play (1992), I Can Problem Solve (2008), Walk Away, Ignore, Talk, Seek Help (2003), Making Choices: Social Problem Skills for Children (2005), Friend to Friend (2009), Second Step (2002), Social Aggression Prevention Program (2006), Sisters of Nia (2004).

When designing a prevention program, it is important to remember to keep the program age and gender appropriate.&lt;ref name="Leff, S. R. 2010"/&gt; For example, Early Childhood Friendship Project and You Can't Say You Can't Play have visual activities for the preschoolers and integrate puppet shows into the lesson plan. In addition, because males and females approach aggression differently there must be personalized plans to fit both genders.

However, intervention programs even with the best intentions can be harmful.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; For one, the progress of the intervention can be short lived. Studies have measured the effectiveness of intervention programs three separate times during the course of one year and no improvements were shown. Secondly, because social aggression is said to increase social identity and belonging to a group, many students have tried to disrupt the programs. A third implication is that the interventions need to study how adverse behaviors develop. Otherwise the solution might not fit the problem. Lastly, the programs must be designed to fit the needs of girls and boys and not the ones of the researchers. If the intervention program is designed to give insight for research rather than reducing and bettering aggression, then it can be detrimental to society.

Although a few forms of behavior may be sex-specific, in general they reflect patterns of power and control between the sexes, which are found in all human groups, regardless of sex composition. These modes of behaviors are perhaps more appropriately labeled 'powerlects' instead of 'genderlects'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lamb | first = Theodore A. | title = Nonverbal and paraverbal control in Dyads and Triads: sex or power differences? | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;53 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.2307/3033863 | date = March 1981 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3033863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listening and attentiveness===
In a conversation, meaning does not reside in the words spoken, but it filled in by the person listening.  Each person decides if they think others are speaking in the spirit of differing status or symmetrical connection. The likelihood that individuals will tend to interpret someone else's words as one or the other depends more on the hearer's own focus, concerns, and habits than on the spirit in which the words were intended.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

It appears that women attach more weight than men to the importance of [[Empathy|listening]] in conversation, with its connotations of power to the listener as confidant of the speaker. This attachment of import by women to listening is inferred by women's normally lower rate of interruption &amp;mdash; i.e., disrupting the flow of conversation with a topic unrelated to the previous one&lt;ref name="PFishman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interactional shitwork | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170321032801/http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | archive-date = 21 March 2017 | url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | work = [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]], special issue: Patterns of Communication and Space Among Women | pages = 99&amp;ndash;101 | date = May 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; and by their largely increased use of minimal responses in relation to men.&lt;ref name="ZimmWest"/&gt; Men, however, interrupt far more frequently with non-related topics, especially in the mixed sex setting and, far from rendering a female speaker's responses minimal, are apt to greet her conversational spotlights with silence, as the work of Victoria DeFrancisco demonstrates.&lt;ref name="DeFrancisco"/&gt;

When men talk, women listen and agree.  However men tend to misinterpret this agreement, which was intended in a spirit of connection, as a reflection of status and power.  A man might conclude that a woman is indecisive or insecure as a result of her listening and attempts of acknowledgment.  When in all actuality, a woman's reasons for behaving this way have nothing to do with her attitudes toward her knowledge, but are a result of her attitudes toward her relationships. The act of giving information frames the speaker with a higher status, while the act of listening frames the listener as lower.  However, when women listen to men, they are not necessarily thinking in terms of status, but in terms of connection and support.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

===Marriages===

Individual roles are gendered by social interaction, the media, and language. There are certain stereotypes society places on the way men and women communicate. Women are often believed to talk too much while men talk too little. Men are stereotyped to be more of a public speaker and leader, while women are stereotyped to talk more in private among their family and friends. For women, society views their use of communication as a way to express feelings and emotions. For men, society views their use of communication as a way to express power and negotiate status among other individuals.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt; There are also certain societal stereotypes about how men and women communicate within a heterosexual marriage or relationship. When a man and a women are communicating within their relationship, the traditional language roles are altered. The man becomes more passive and the woman becomes more active. A man's stereotypical silent communication style is often disappointing for women, while a woman's emotionally articulate communication style is often seen as aggravating for a man.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt; This creates the assumption that women and men have opposing communication styles, therefore creating society's cliche that men and women don't understand each other. This leads to many inter-relational quarrels because of one individual blaming the other for communicating inefficiently due to using the communication style that society has constructed according to their biological sex.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;{{Failed verification|talk=I just don't understand|date=May 2016}}

===Dominance versus subjection===
This, in turn, suggests a dichotomy between a male desire for conversational dominance – noted by Helena Leet-Pellegrini with reference to male experts speaking more verbosely than their female counterparts – and a female aspiration to group conversational participation.&lt;ref name="Leet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Leet-Pellegrini | first = Helena M. | chapter = Conversational dominance as a function of gender and expertise | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8w1iAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Giles | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Robinson | editor-first2 = W. Peters | editor-last3 = Smith | editor-first3 = Philip M. | title = Language: social psychological perspectives: selected papers from the first International Conference on Social Psychology and Language held at the University of Bristol, England, July 1979 | pages = 97&amp;ndash;104 | publisher = Pergamon Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780080246963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One corollary of this is, according to Jennifer Coates, that males are afforded more attention in the context of the classroom and that this can lead to their gaining more attention in scientific and technical subjects, which in turn can lead to their achieving better success in those areas, ultimately leading to their having more power in a technocratic society.&lt;ref name="Coates93"&gt;{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language : a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781315645612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversation is not the only area where power is an important aspect of the male/female dynamic. Power is reflected in every aspect of communication from what the actual topic of the communication, to the ways in which it is communicated.  Women are typically less concerned with power more concerned with forming and maintaining relationships, whereas men are more concerned with their status. Girls and women feel it is crucial that they be liked by their peers, a form of involvement that focuses on symmetrical connection.  Boys and men feel it is crucial that they be respected by their peers, as form of involvement that focuses on asymmetrical status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = I only say this because I love you | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781860499814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in priorities are reflected in the ways in which men and women communicate.  A woman's communication will tend to be more focused on building and maintaining relationships.  Men on the other hand, will place a higher priority on power, their communication styles will reflect their desire to maintain their status in the relationship.

According to Tannen's research, men tend to tell stories as another way to maintain their status.  Primarily, men tell jokes, or stories that focus on themselves.  Women on the other hand, are less concerned with their own power, and therefore their stories revolve not around themselves, but around others. By putting themselves on the same level as those around them, women attempt to downplay their part in their own stories, which strengthens their connections to those around them.

===Politeness===
Lakoff identified three forms of politeness: formal, deference, and camaraderie. Women's language is characterized by formal and deference politeness, whereas men's language is exemplified by camaraderie.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"/&gt;

Politeness in speech is described in terms of positive and negative face.&lt;ref name="Brown+Levinson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = Penelope |last2 = Levinson | first2 = Stephen | chapter = Universals in language usage: politeness phenomena | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvFsAAAAIAAJ | editor-last = Goody | editor-first = Esther | title = Questions and politeness: strategies in social interaction | pages = 56&amp;ndash;289 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780521292504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Positive face'' refers to one's desire to be liked and admired, while ''negative face'' refers to one's wish to remain autonomous and not to suffer imposition. Both forms, according to Penelope Brown's study of the Tzeltal language, are used more frequently by women whether in mixed or single-sex pairs, suggesting for Brown a greater sensitivity in women than have men to face the needs of others.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Penelope | chapter = How and why are women more polite: some evidence from a Mayan community | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=10NbPwAACAAJ | editor-last1 = McConnell-Ginet | editor-first1 = Sally | editor-last2 = Borker | editor-first2 = Ruth | editor-last3 = Furman | editor-first3 = Nelly | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = 111&amp;ndash;136 | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780275905200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, women are to all intents and purposes largely more polite than men. However, negative face politeness can be potentially viewed as weak language because of its associated [[hedge (linguistics)|hedge]]s and tag questions, a view propounded by O'Barr and Atkins (1980) in their work on courtroom interaction.&lt;ref name="OBarr"/&gt;

==Gender-specific vocabulary==
Some natural languages have intricate systems of gender-specific [[vocabulary]].

* [[Irish Sign Language]], due to single sex Deaf schools, developed separate male and female vocabularies which can still be seen today.
*  It is speculated that [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] women had a special language called ''Emesal'', distinct from the main language, ''Emegir'', which was spoken by both genders. The women's language had a distinct vocabulary, found in the records of religious rituals to be performed by women, also in the speech of goddesses in mythological texts. There has been some dispute about the role of Emesal, with suggestions by some scholars that Emegir was a dialect used by the public and more informally while Emesal was a literary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Whittaker | first = Gordon | chapter = Linguistic anthropology and the study of Emesal as (a) women's language | chapter-url = https://www.scribd.com/document/45691958/Whittaker-Linguistic-Anthropology-and-Emesal | editor-last1 = Parpola | editor-first1 = Simo | editor-last2 = Whiting | editor-first2 = Robert M. | title = Sex and gender in the ancient Near East: proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki, July 2-6, 2001 | pages = 633&amp;ndash;644 | publisher = Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project | location = Helsinki | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789514590542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a significant period of time in the history of the ancient [[languages of India]], after the formal language [[Sanskrit]] diverged from the popular [[Prakrit]] languages, some Sanskrit plays recorded the speech of women in Prakrit, distinct from the Sanskrit of male speakers.  This convention was also used for illiterate and low-caste male speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halder | first = Shashwati | chapter = Prakrit |chapter-url = http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Prakrit | editor-last1 = Islam | editor-first1 = Sirajul | editor-last2 = Jamal | editor-first2 = Shashwati | title = Banglapedia: national encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = [[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] | location = Dhaka | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9789845120364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]] has a vocabulary split between terms used only by men and terms used only by women. This does not however affect the entire vocabulary but when it does, the terms used by men generally come from [[Cariban languages|Carib]] and those used by women come from [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* The indigenous Australian language [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]] has separate dialects for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kirton | first = Jean F. | chapter = Yanyuwa, a dying language | chapter-url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=21977 | editor-last = Ray | editor-first = Michael J. | title = Aboriginal language use in the Northern Territory: 5 reports: Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics | pages = 1&amp;ndash;18 | publisher = Summer Institute of Linguistics | location = Darwin | year =  1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Ancient Greek]], there is evidence for some difference between the speech of men and women, as evidenced for example in the comedies of [[Aristophanes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*In the [[Lakota language]], a small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. While many native speakers and linguists agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular genders, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Trechter | first = Sarah | chapter =  Contextualizing the exotic few: gender dichotomies in Lakhota | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O5rmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101 | editor-last1 = Bucholtz | editor-first1 = Mary | editor-last2 = Liang | editor-first2 = A.C. | editor-last3 = Sutton | editor-first3 = Laurel A. | title = Reinventing identities: the gendered self in discourse | pages = 101&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York London | year = 1999 | isbn = 0195126297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">[[Image:PancakeCutThrice.agr.jpg|thumb|Pancake cut into seven pieces with three straight cuts.]]
The '''lazy caterer's sequence,''' more formally known as the '''central polygonal numbers''', describes the maximum number of pieces of a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] (a [[pancake]] or [[pizza]] is usually used to describe the situation) that can be made with a given number of straight cuts. For example, three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a common point inside the circle, but up to seven if they do not. This problem can be formalized mathematically as one of counting the cells in an [[arrangement of lines]]; for generalizations to higher dimensions, ''see'' [[arrangement of hyperplanes]].

The analogue of this sequence in three dimensions is the [[cake number]].

==Formula and sequence==
The maximum number ''p'' of pieces that can be created with a given number of cuts ''n'', where ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{n^2+n+2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[binomial coefficient]]s, the formula can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;p = 1 + {\tbinom {n + 1} 2} = {\tbinom n 0}+{\tbinom n 1}+{\tbinom n 2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This [[sequence]] {{OEIS|id=A000124}}, starting with &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, results in

:[[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[16 (number)|16]], [[22 (number)|22]], [[29 (number)|29]], [[37 (number)|37]], [[46 (number)|46]], [[56 (number)|56]], [[67 (number)|67]], [[79 (number)|79]], [[92 (number)|92]], [[106 (number)|106]], [[121 (number)|121]], [[137 (number)|137]], [[154 (number)|154]], [[172 (number)|172]], [[191 (number)|191]], [[211 (number)|211]], ...

Each number equals 1 plus a [[triangular number]].

==Proof==
[[File:Lazy Caterer's Sequence (Cuts).gif|thumb|The maximum number of pieces from consecutive cuts are the numbers in the Lazy Caterer's Sequence.]]
When a circle is cut ''n'' times to produce the maximum number of pieces, represented as ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;fnof;''(''n''), the ''n''th cut must be considered; the number of pieces before the last cut is ''&amp;fnof;''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1), while the number of pieces added by the last cut is ''n''.

To obtain the maximum number of pieces, the ''n''th cut line should cross all the other previous cut lines inside the circle, but not cross any intersection of previous cut lines. Thus, the ''n''th line itself is cut in ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 places, and into ''n'' line segments.  Each segment divides one piece of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-cut pancake into 2 parts, adding exactly ''n'' to the number of pieces. The new line can't have any more segments since it can only cross each previous line once.  A cut line can always cross over all previous cut lines, as rotating the knife at a small angle around a point that is not an existing intersection will, if the angle is small enough, intersect all the previous lines including the last one added.

Thus, the total number of pieces after ''n'' cuts is

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+f(n-1).&lt;/math&gt;

This [[recurrence relation]] can be solved.  If ''&amp;fnof;''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) is expanded one term the relation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+(n-1)+f(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Expansion of the term ''&amp;fnof;''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) can continue until the last term is reduced to ''&amp;fnof;''(0), thus,

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+(n-1)+(n-2)+\cdots+1+f(0).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;, because there is one piece before any cuts are made, this can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=1+(1+2+3+\cdots + n).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified, using the formula for the sum of an [[arithmetic progression]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=1+\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Marcel Linsman Prize''' (or '''Linsman Prize''') is a Belgian prize awarded every 3 years by the influential AILg (Association des Ingenieurs Diplomés de la Université de Liège), a Belgian academic association of engineers, to living scientists for excellence in the biomedical sciences. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.ailg.be/index.php?page=prix-marcel-linsman|title= Prix Marcel Linsman|publisher=Association des Ingenieurs Diplomés de la Université de Liège|accessdate = 26 November 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is restricted to researchers with a medical or engineering degree having performed research in Belgium. The age limit is 45 years but there is no restriction on the citizenship. For many years, the preference has been given to researchers in the field of neuroscience. This prize is awarded in memory of Marcel Linsman (1912-1989), distinguished University Professor.

The prize is usually awarded during an official ceremony taking place in one Belgian university during which two other prestigious prizes in different fields are awarded. Similar to other prestigious prize ceremonies, the recipients deliver a scientific presentation of their research.

The reputation achieved by this prize is ubiquitously recognized amongst academics in Europe.

== Marcel Linsman ==
Born in Liège on 22 June 1912, he studied mathematical sciences at the University of Liège, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1934. In 1937, he received his doctorate, with the highest distinction" He was appointed assistant professor at Liège in 1938, and in 1964, full professor.  In 1943, he became interested in numerical calculation and recognized immediately the electronic possibilities.  He moved to Harvard University in 1947. From 1951 to 1955, he managed the development of one of the earliest European electronic computers, known as Machine I.R.S.I.A. His interest then took him into non-numerical applications of the computer. Starting with automatic translation, he initiated many projects, including teaching informatics and medical applications. Throughout his career, he was the recipient of many awards.

In IFIP, he was present from the first Council meeting in Rome until 1971, representing the Belgian member society. He was also active in the Technical Committee on Education (TC3). During the time IFIP was registered in Belgium, 1962 through 1967, he served as IFIP Assistant Secretary and handled all legal matters for IFIP.  In 1974, he was in the first group to receive the IFIP Silver Core Award.

Marcel Linsman died during the night from 18 to 19 April 1989.  A foundation in his name has been established to promote scientific excellence in the field of biomedical sciences.

The '''Maritime Archaeology Trust''' (formerly the '''Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology''') is a [[charitable trust]] that researches and excavates maritime archaeology and heritage in [[Great Britain]]. Historically, their core activities were focused around [[Hampshire]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Solent]], but now they work in other parts of the country and on international projects.

==History==
The discovery of the wreck of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']] at [[The Needles]] in 1969 led the [[Isle of Wight Council]] to fund and organise a team to research and excavate the site.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Medland, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; As more wrecks were discovered in the following decades, the '''Isle of Wight Maritime Heritage Project''' was formed. The project originally focused on the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck|Yarmouth Roads Protected Wreck Site]] but also began to identify [[Mesolithic]] sites on the seabed of the [[Solent]].&lt;ref name=Sparks3&gt;Sparks, Momber &amp; Satchell, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BA32&gt;British Archaeology, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  When central government funds were withdrawn, the project was re-organised as the '''Isle of Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology''' in 1990. The Trust managed the excavation of several sites and became the [[licensee]] for many of them.&lt;ref name=M52/&gt;  In 1991, with support from [[Hampshire County Council]], the Trust's scope expanded and it became the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology.&lt;ref name=Sparks3/&gt;&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt; In 2013, it became the Maritime Archaeology Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/mat|title=HWTMA is MAT|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The charity has since investigated a great deal of maritime archaeology around the Solent, including shipwrecks, submerged landscapes and inter-tidal foreshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/research|title=Archaeological Research|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also conducted projects as far away as [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Farasan Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/sublocation|title=Submerged prehistory|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bouldnor Cliff===
In 1999 divers from the Trust discovered the Mesolithic settlement site of [[Bouldnor Cliff]]. The site is offshore of [[Bouldnor]] on the Isle of Wight and about 11 metres below the surface of the Solent.&lt;ref&gt;British Archaeology, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Attention was first drawn to the site when divers observed a lobster discarding worked flint tools from its burrow.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC|date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, regular fieldwork has revealed that Bouldnor was almost certainly a settlement site approximately 8,000 years ago (6,000 BC), at a time when lower sea levels meant that the Solent was an extensive river valley. Work done so far has revealed that the technology of Mesolithic settlers was probably 2,000 years ahead of what had previously been believed.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Diving into the Past| newspaper =Isle of Wight County Press | pages =14 | date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forton Lake===
Between 2006 and 2009, the Trust ran a joint community archaeology project at [[Forton Lake]], with the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]], cataloguing the wide range of [[hulk (medieval ship type)|hulk]]s there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/forton.php|title=Forton Lake|publisher=Nautical Archaeology Society|date=|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425123831/http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/forton.php|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was designed to raise local awareness and foster a sense of local pride and ownership amongst nearby residents in [[Gosport]].&lt;ref&gt;Forton Lake, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centaur Tanks===
In a joint project with [[Southsea Sub Aqua Club]], the Trust has investigated two [[Centaur tank]]s from a capsized [[Landing Craft Tank]] in the Solent, as part of a case study to see if land based legislation can be used to protect maritime archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isle of Wight's sunken World War II tanks studied |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-14322864 |publisher=BBC |date= 28 July 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mystery Wreck===
The Trust investigated a 'mystery wreck' on [[Horse Tail Sands]] in the Solent between 2003 and 2011. It was not until 2011 that the Trust was able to confirm the vessel's identity as the ''Flower of Ugie'', a 19th-century [[barque]]. As well as fully recording the vessel's remains, the Trust replicated the process of wreck research and identification in a teaching pack for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.solentforum.org/resources/pdf/solnews/S%20News%20issue%2030%20web.pdf|title=Mystery Shipwreck Solved|publisher=Solent Forum|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissemination and education==
The Trust runs an active outreach and schools programme and operates a "Maritime Bus" to make maritime archaeology more accessible to the general public. The bus attends regular events in the south coast, including school, community and other public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schools.hwtma.org.uk/maritimebus|title= The Maritime Bus|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamblevalley.com/home/great-outdoors/heritage.php|title=Hamble Valley; History and Heritage|publisher=The Marketing Collective|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218165816/http://www.hamblevalley.com/home/great-outdoors/heritage.php|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust also runs the [[Sunken Secrets]] exhibition at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Burdett &amp; Insole, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Trust was awarded a [[Europa Nostra]] award for [[Europa Nostra#Categories|Category 4: Education, Training and Awareness Raising]], for "raising the profile of maritime heritage and archaeology", recognising the numerous ways in which the Trust teaches audiences of all types about maritime heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.europanostra.org/projects/64/|title=Raising Awareness of Maritime Cultural Heritage - Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology|publisher=Europa Nostra|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime Archaeology Limited==
In 2004, the Trust formed '''Maritime Archaeology Ltd''' as a commercial trading arm in order to provide archaeological contractual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeology.co.uk/about-maritime-archaeology/|title=About Maritime Archaeology Ltd.|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Limited|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical jurisprudence''' or '''legal medicine''' is the branch of [[science]] and [[medicine]] involving the study and application of scientific and medical knowledge to legal problems, such as [[inquest]]s, and in the field of [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodric Romeyn Beck and William Dunloop. (1825.) ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'', 2 ed., Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[modern medicine]] is a legal creation, regulated by the state, and medicolegal cases involving [[death]], [[rape]], [[Parent|paternity]], etc. require a medical practitioner to produce evidence and appear as an [[expert witness]], these two fields have traditionally been interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Mohr. (1993.) ''Doctors and the Law: Medical Jurisprudence in Nineteenth-Century America'', Oxford University Press, New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic medicine, which includes [[forensic pathology]], is a narrower field that involves collection and analysis of medical evidence (samples) to produce objective information for use in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Swaine Taylor and Frederick John Smith (ed.). (1920.) ''Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence'', 7 ed., Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Paul Zacchias]] is one of the earliest figures of medical jurisprudence, with association with the [[Papal States]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title='On the Beliefs of the Greeks': Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy|last=Hartnup|first=Karen|date=2004-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004131809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias was the personal physician to [[Pope Innocentius X]] and [[Pope Alexander VII]], as well as legal adviser to the [[Rota Romana]].&lt;ref name="medico"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7RXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA532&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=The Medico-legal journal, Volume 2|publisher=Medico-Legal Journal Association|year=1885|author=Medico-Legal Society of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most well known book, ''Quaestiones medico-legales'' (1621-1651) established [[legal medicine]] as a topic of study.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFTlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1572&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=JAMA.: The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 38|last=|first=|publisher=American Medical Association, HighWire Press|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias work contains [[Superstition|superstitious]] views on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], and [[demon]]s which were widely held at the time.&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=Northwestern lancet, Volume 18|year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical jurisprudence had a chair founded at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1807, first occupied by [[Andrew Duncan, the younger]]. It was imposed on the university by the administration of [[Charles James Fox]], and in particular [[Henry Erskine (lawyer)|Henry Erskine]] working with [[Andrew Duncan, the elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8213|title=Duncan, Andrew (1773–1832)|first=Brenda M.|last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Medical jurisprudence is concerned with a broad range of medical, legal, and ethical issues, as well as [[human right]]s and [[Individual and group rights|rights of individuals]].

Physicians have a duty to act in their patients best interest and can be charged in a court of law if they fail to do so. On the other hand, a physician may be required to act in the interest of third parties if his patient is a danger to others. Failure to do so may lead to legal action against the physician.

Medical jurisprudence includes:
*questions of the legal and [[medical ethics|ethical duties]] of physicians;
*questions affecting the civil

Under the second heading, there are many aspects, including:
*questions of [[competence (law)|competence]] or [[sanity]] in civil or criminal proceedings;
*questions of competence of [[Minor (law)|minors]] in matters affecting their own health; and,
*questions of lawful fitness or safety to drive a motor vehicle, pilot an aeroplane, use [[scuba gear]], play certain sports, or to join certain occupations.

Under the third heading, there are also many aspects, including:
*assessment of illness or injuries that may be work-related (see [[workers' compensation]] or [[occupational safety and health]]) or otherwise compensable;
*assessment of injuries of minors that may relate to [[Neglect (English law)|neglect]] or [[Child abuse|abuse]]; and,
*[[death certificate|certification of death]] or else the [[Coroner|assessment of possible causes of death]]. This, however, is the more commonly understood, albeit narrow, meaning of forensic medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11280">'''Microspherulites''' are microscopic spherical particles with diameter less than two&amp;nbsp;mm, usually in the 100 micrometre range, mainly consisting of mineral material (the Greek ''litos'' means "stone"). Only bodies created by natural physico-chemical processes, with no contribution of either biological (in [[aqueous]] [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] this contribution is possible) or human activity, are considered to be microspherulites.
Generally speaking, the common feature ([[sphericity]]) indicates that each sphere represents an internal equilibrium of forces within a fluid medium (water, air).

==Classification==

Several types of these forms are found in nature. Depending on the formational environment, microspherulites can be classed as [[oolite]]s, [[micrometeorite]]s, impact spherulites, [[iberulite]]s, [[pisolite]]s, [[Meteorite|aerolites]], [[chondrule]]s, [[biolite]]s, pellets, bubbles, or carbonaceous microspherules.

===Aqueous environment===
[[File:Detailed group of oolites.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 1: Oolites observed with a transmitted light microscope.]]

* Oolites are internally structured spheres, composed mainly by [[calcium carbonate]] (Figure 1).  They are a type of constituent in [[limestone]]. The size of these [[ooid]]s ranges between 0.25 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm. The name derives from the Greek ''ooion'' (egg). They are formed by growing larger and accreting material as they move around. They accomplish this either (a) by physical attachment of [[Granularity|fine-grained]] material as they roll around, much in the manner of a snowball, and (b) by the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of material in solution, much as salt crystallizes from water during evaporation. In the former case they have thin concentric layers, and in the latter they have radiating sprays of crystals. However, a combination of both processes can be found. Microbes could contribute to their development.

===Aerial environment===

* Micrometeorites are typically metallic microspherules (iron or iron and nickel) but can also be formed by [[silicate minerals]], whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial [[meteoroids]], resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth’s atmosphere]]. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface. The degree of heating and their original composition determine that only a few minerals have been founded in micrometeorites. They have not yet been properly classified.
* Impact spherulites occur when a large extraterrestrial object strikes Earth at cosmic velocity, melts and vaporizes, silicate materials can condense into high spheroidal, sand-sized particles deposited around the point of impact. Unaltered impact spherulites consist entirely of glass ([[Tektite|microtektites]]) or a combination of glass and crystals grown in flight (microkrystites). Primary crystals are only common in microspherulites from two [[Phanerozoic]] impact layers: the Upper Eocene microkrystite or [[clinopyroxene]] spherule layer &lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Glass, B.P., Burns, C.A., Crosbie, J.R., DuBois, D.L., 1985. Late Eocene North American Microtektites and Clinopyroxene-Bearing Spherules, Proceedings of the Sixteenth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Part 1. [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] 90, D 175-D 196.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary]] (K/T boundary) layer.&lt;ref name="vr2"&gt;Smit, J., 1999: The global stratigraphy of the. Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact ejecta. Annu. Rev. Earth Planetary Science, 27: 75-113. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/action/doSearch?action=runSearch&amp;type=advanced&amp;result=true&amp;prevSearch=%2Bauthorsfield%3A(Smit%2C+J.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other crystalline phases may be [[olivine]], ''Fe-rich pyroxene'', [[spinel]]s and [[feldspar]]s. Frequently the crystals are replaced by [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phases such as [[goethite]], [[pyrite]], [[glauconite]], ''[[K-feldspar]]s'', [[quartz]], [[sericite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and ''carbonates''.

[[File:Group of iberulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 2: Group of iberulites observed under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The arrows show vortex position.]]
* [[Iberulite]]s are ''co-associations'' of well-defined minerals, together with non-crystalline compounds, with axial geometry and a characteristic depression (vortex), structured around a coarse-grained core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]]  rind, and pinkish colour (Figure 2). They are formed at present in the [[troposphere]] by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions. The modal size is in the 60-90 micrometre range, and the shapes are almost perfect spheres. Their name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], indicating the place where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr3"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., 2000. Aportaciones sólidas a la atmósfera originadas por un incendio forestal en el ámbito mediterráneo. Estudios Geológicos 56, 153–161. [http://estudiosgeol.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgeol/article/viewFile/147/146]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are related to intrusions of aerosol plumes from the [[Sahara desert]]. The mineralogy of the core (tens of micrometres thick) is commonly formed by [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]]  and [[feldspar]]s, while the most frequent minerals of the rind (a few micrometres thick) are [[clay minerals]], mainly smectites (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]  and impregnation of [[sulfate minerals]]   (mainly [[gypsum]], [[alunite]] and [[jarosite]]) and [[halide minerals|chlorides]].&lt;ref name="vr4"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., Párraga, 2008.

==Other related terms==

* Pisolites are spheroidal particles, larger in size and commonly more distorted than ooids. The name derives from the Greek ''pisos'' (pea). Mineral concentrations ([[bauxite]]s, [[limonite]]s, [[siderite]]s) and the pedogenic [[Caliche (mineral)|caliches]] (subaerial environment) can have pisolitic structure. They usually reach 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and for this reason they can not strictly be considered microspherulites. Dunham (1969) &lt;ref name="vr5"&gt;Dunham, R.J., 1969. Vadose pisolites in the Capitan Reefs (Permian) New Mexico and Texas, in Depositional Environments in carbonate rocks: Soc. Econ. Palaeontologists and Mineralogists Spec. Publ. 14, 182-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  considered them associated to caliches, while Pray and Esteban (1977) &lt;ref name="vr6"&gt;Esteban, M., Pray, L.C., 1977. Origin of the pisolite facies of the shelf crest. In: Upper Guadalupian facies Permian Reef complex, Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico and West Texas. 1977 Field Conference Guidebook. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Permian Basin Section, Publication 77-16: 479-483.
[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/gumo/1993_26/bibliography.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested they were formed by inorganic precipitation from [[brine]]s.

* Aerolite is a generic term indicating lithogenic elements gathered from the atmosphere. This term does not imply sphericity or microscopic size.
* Chondrules are the microscopic constituents of [[chondrite]]s that represent 80% of the [[meteorite]]s that fall to the Earth per the   [[Meteoritical Society]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Chondrules range in diameter from a few micrometres to over 1&amp;nbsp;cm. They are formed by rapid heating of solid precursor material and subsequent melting, followed by slow cooling. Their main composition is silicate minerals such as olivine and [[pyroxene]], surrounded by feldspars (crystalline or glassy); minor minerals are ''Fe-sulfide'', metallic Fe-Ni and [[oxide]]s.
* Biolites are biologically produced, many organisms can produce mineral particles dubbed in general biolites. Their shape, size and composition may be very varied. As examples we can cite [[otolith|otolites]] (compounds of the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]]) and the calculi resulting from various [[histopathology|histopathologies]]. Studies have confirmed that microorganisms are able to precipitate minerals.&lt;ref name="vr7"&gt;Verrecchia, E.P., Freytet, P., Verrecchia, K.E., Dumont, J.L., 1995. Spherulites in calcrete laminar crusts: biogenic CaCO3, precipitation as a major contributor to crust formation. J. Sed. Research A65, 690–700.

* Pellets are those homogeneous aggregates with no internal structure, consisting of [[Micrite|micritic calcite]], spherical to ellipsoidal in shape and with sizes between 0.03 and 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm. They are thought to be faecal particles from aquatic organisms.

[[File:Glass microspherulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 3: Solid glass microspheres used like ingredients in road and street signaling paintings.]]
* Bubbles include frequently unstable spherules which may be produced by the dispersion of two immiscible fluids forming an emulsion. Usually this term is applied to air-water [[emulsion]]s, but it is also valid for water-air (hazes, drops) or other liquid fluids (oil-water).
* Carbonaceous microspherules are a type of [[soot]] particle floating in the atmosphere, produced by [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] combustion processes of fuels, and may be coated with a layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulfates or both. These particles are hollow microspherules that are black in colour, and made up of carbon or [[graphite]]. The size ranges from tens to a hundred micrometres.
* Artefacts are spherules intentionally produced spherical particles for use in industry or medicine. The shape is often perfectly spherical, truly uniform and size ranging ~ 50&amp;nbsp;nm to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Nanoparticle|nanospheres]]), or 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 1000&amp;nbsp;µm ([[microsphere]]s). They may be made up of organic-inorganic compounds and provided with different properties. In fact, commercially, microspheres can be found manufactured from materials such as glass, polymers (polyethylene, polystyrene) or ceramic. Microspheres can be solid or hollow, and so their density will be very different as well as their applications. Hollow microspheres usually are added to reduce the density of a material. Solid microspheres have numerous applications depending on their size and their manufacture material. Solid glass microspheres are used in fields such as roads and streets signaling (Figure 3). They are added to paintings used for traffic signs and roadway surface signaling to incorporate the retroreflective effect. So they improve the night visibility of the way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7529">In [[theoretical computer science]], '''multiparty communication complexity''' is the study of [[communication complexity]] in the setting where there are more than 2 players.

In the traditional two–party [[communication complexity|communication game]], introduced by {{harvtxt|Yao|1979}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2):\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\},\  x_1,x_2\in\{0,1\}^{n'},\  2n'=n&lt;/math&gt;

Player ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knows the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knows the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; does not know the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2. 

In other words, the players know the other's variables, but not their own. The minimum number of bits that must be communicated by the players to compute ''f'' is the [[communication complexity]] of ''f'', denoted by&amp;nbsp;''κ''(''f'').

The multiparty communication game, defined in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a powerful generalization of the 2–party case: Here the players know all the others' input, except their own. Because of this property, sometimes this model is called "numbers on the forehead" model, since if the players were seated around a round table, each wearing their own input on the forehead, then every player would see all the others' input, except their own.

The formal definition is as follows: ''k'' players: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; intend to compute a Boolean function 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n):\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;

On set ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} of variables there is a fixed partition ''A'' of ''k'' classes ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and player ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knows every variable, ''except'' those in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,2,...,''k''. The players have unlimited computational power, and they  communicate with the help of a blackboard, viewed by all players.

The aim is to compute ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), such  that at the end of the computation, every player knows this value. The cost of the computation is the number of bits written onto the blackboard for the given input ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and partition ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The cost of a multiparty protocol is the maximum number of bits communicated for any ''x'' from the set {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the given partition ''A''. The ''k''-party communication complexity, ''C''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''), of a
function ''f'', with respect to partition ''A'', is the minimum of costs of those ''k''-party protocols which compute ''f''. The ''k''-party symmetric communication complexity of ''f'' is defined as 

: &lt;math&gt;C^{(k)}(f)=\max_AC^{(k)}_A(f) &lt;/math&gt;

where the maximum is taken over all ''k''-partitions of set ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Upper and lower bounds ==

For a general upper bound both for two and more players, let us suppose that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the smallest classes  of the partition ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can compute any Boolean function of ''S'' with |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 bits of communication: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; writes down the |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| bits of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the blackboard, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; reads it, and computes and announces the value ''f''(''x''). So, we can write:

: &lt;math&gt;C^{(k)}(f)\leq\bigg\lfloor{n\over k}\bigg\rfloor+1.&lt;/math&gt;

'''NEST''' is a [[simulation software]] for spiking neural network models, including large-scale neuronal networks. NEST was initially developed by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig and is now developed and maintained by the NEST Initiative.

== Modeling philosophy ==

A NEST [[simulation]] tries to follow the logic of an [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the [[Biological neural network|neural system]] to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter.

The neural system is defined by a possibly large number of [[Biological neuron model|neurons]] and their [[Synapse|connections]]. In a NEST network, different neuron and synapse models can coexist. Any two neurons can have multiple connections with different properties. Thus, the connectivity can in general not be described by a weight or [[Adjacency matrix|connectivity matrix]] but rather as an [[adjacency list]].

To manipulate or observe the network dynamics, the experimenter can define so-called devices which represent the various instruments (for measuring and stimulation) found in an experiment. These devices write their data either to [[Computer memory|memory]] or to file.

NEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be added.

==Example==
[[File:NEST raster.png|thumb|NEST raster]]

The following example simulates spiking activity in a sparse random network with recurrent excitation and inhibition&lt;ref&gt;Brunel, N. (2000). Dynamics of sparsely connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. [http://www.springerlink.com/index/U446L5722LP03677.pdf Journal of computational neuroscience, 8(3), 183–208.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure shows the [[Action potential|spiking activity]] of 50 neurons as a [[raster plot]]. Time increases along the horizontal axis, neuron id increases along the vertical axis.  Each dot corresponds to a [[Action potential|spike]] of the respective neuron at a given time. The lower part of the figure shows a [[histogram]] with the mean firing-rate of the neurons.

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import nest
import nest.raster_plot

J_ex  = 0.1 # excitatory weight
J_in  = -0.5 # inhibitory weight
p_rate = 20000. # external Poisson rate

neuron_params= {"C_m": 1.0, "tau_m": 20.0, "t_ref": 2.0,
                "E_L": 0.0, "V_reset": 0.0, "V_m": 0.0, "V_th": 20.0}

# Set parameters of neurons and devices
nest.SetDefaults("iaf_psc_delta", neuron_params)
nest.SetDefaults("poisson_generator",{"rate": p_rate})
nest.SetDefaults("spike_detector",{"withtime": True, "withgid": True})

# Create neurons and devices

# Configure synapse models
nest.CopyModel("static_synapse","excitatory",{"weight":J_ex, "delay":1.5})
nest.CopyModel("static_synapse","inhibitory",{"weight":J_in, "delay":1.5})

# Connect the random net and instrument it with the devices
nest.Connect(nodes_ex, nodes_ex+nodes_in,  {"rule": 'fixed_indegree', "indegree": 1000}, "excitatory")
nest.Connect(nodes_in, nodes_ex+nodes_in,  {"rule": 'fixed_indegree', "indegree": 250}, "inhibitory")
nest.Connect(noise, nodes_ex+nodes_in, syn_spec="excitatory")
nest.Connect(nodes_ex[1:51], espikes)

# Simulate for 100. ms

==History==

NEST development was started in 1993 by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig at the [[Ruhr University| Ruhr University Bochum]], [[Bochum]], Germany and the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]]. At this time, the simulator was called SYNOD and simulations were defined in a stack based simulation language, called SLI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7KXmIv6ROY Video documentary on NEST] by the German [[Bernstein Network]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the software changed its name from SYNOD to NEST. Until 2004, NEST was exclusively developed and used by the founding members of the NEST Initiative. The first public release appeared in summer 2004. Since then, NEST was released regularly, about once or twice per year.

Since 2007, NEST supports hybrid parallelism, using [[POSIX threads]] and [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]].&lt;ref name="dx" /&gt;

In 2008, the stack-based simulation language SLI was superseded by a modern [[Python (programming language)|Python]] interface, however, the old simulation language is still used internally.&lt;ref&gt;Eppler, J. M., Helias, M., Diesmann, M., Muller, E., &amp; Gewaltig, M.-O. (2008). PyNEST: a convenient interface to the NEST simulator. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 2(January), 1–12. doi:10.3389/neuro.11.012.2008&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, the simulator independent specification language [[PyNN (software)|PyNN]] was developed with support for NEST.&lt;ref&gt;A. Davison, D. Brüderle, J. Eppler, J. Kremkow, E. Muller, D. Pecevski, L. Perrinet and P. Yger, PyNN: a common interface for neuronal network simulators, Front. Neuroinf. 2:11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, the NEST Initiative changed the license from the proprietary NEST License to [[GPL|GNU GPL]] V2 or later.

== User interfaces ==
* NEST primary user interface is PyNEST, a  [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package that controls the NEST simulation kernel. PyNEST aims at easy usability and seamless interaction with  [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and its libraries.
* [[PyNN (software)|PyNN]] is a simulator independent language for neural simulations, which supports NEST as well as [[Brian (software)|BRIAN]], [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]], as well as neuromorphic hardware.
* NEST also maintains its own simulation language [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] (SLI), which understands a simple [[Stack-oriented programming language]] that is influenced by [[PostScript]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A '''narrative thread''', or '''plot thread''' (or, more ambiguously, a '''storyline'''), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element or [[subplot]] in the [[Fiction|work of fiction]]. In this sense, each narrative thread is the [[narrative]] portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

By utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters  or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the [[suspension of disbelief]] and engages the reader into the story as it develops.

A classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the [[monomyth]], or [[hero's journey]], with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.

The '''National Institute for Biological Standards and Control''' ('''NIBSC''') is a global leader in the field of biological standardisation. It is a centre of the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]]. It is responsible for developing and producing over 90% of the biological international standards in use around the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Institute is the UK's [[Official Medicines Control Laboratory]] (OMCL), responsible for independent regulatory testing of biological medicines within the framework of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nibsc.org/about_us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is also host to the UK Stem Cell Bank and a key UK research centre in the field of pandemic flu. It is situated just west of junction 23 of the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. Half of the building is in Ridge and the eastern half is in the parish of [[South Mimms]].

==History==
The NIBSC began work in May 1972. The National Biological Standards Board was formed in 1975 at the NIMR in [[Mill Hill]]. A site was selected and the new £25m building opened in 1987, although it was officially opened in 1988. It has 4,500 square metres of laboratories. NIBSC employs around 300 staff, 200 of whom are scientists.

In February 2008, it featured in a thirty-minute programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] in the ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/secretscience/ Secret Science]'' two-part series (the other programme was about the [[Health Protection Agency]]'s [[Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response]] at [[Porton Down]]).

In April 2009, NIBSC became centre of the UK [[Health Protection Agency|Health Protection Agency (HPA)]]. In April 2013, the NIBSC left the HPA and was merged with the UK’s [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]].

==Function==
It produces over 90% of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s International Standards for substances such as antibiotics, enzymes, [[Antibody|antibodies]] and hormones, and methods such as [[blood transfusion]]s. These standards form a vital part of global health efforts and pharmaceutical research, and over 10,000 standards a month are shipped worldwide. 
It is the UK's Official Medicines Control Laboratory.

==Facilities==
New buildings for the [http://www.ukstemcellbank.org.uk UK Stem Cell Bank] (which has been on the site [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=188865&amp;sectioncode=26 since] May 19, 2004 and was Europe's first stem cell bank) and [http://www.nibsc.org/flu_site/index.html Influenza Resource Centre] were built on the site in a £12m development by [[Morgan Sindall Group|Morgan Ashurst]] and opened in December 2009.

[[Image:eCover of History-Fiction or Science? Chronology 1,2,3 .jpg|thumb|''History: Fiction or Science? Chronology'' volumes 1–7]]

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

Nosovskiy and Bulgarian mathematician Iordan Tabov who expanded the theory in regards to the Balkans, the theory is mostly discussed in reference to Fomenko's writings.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt;

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], examining the current chronology of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Near East]], expressed discontent with prevailing theories and in ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' proposed one of his own, which, basing its study on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', changed the traditional dating of the Argonautic Expedition, the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank
 | title = Der Mythos von der Geburt des Helden | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | accessdate = 2006-09-09| language = Russian
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г. Каспарова по проблеме «Новой Хронологии»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html "Garry Kasparov and New Chronology"] ''Chess Notes''&lt;/ref&gt; Billington writes that the theory "might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia" if not for Kasparov's writing in support of it in the magazine ''[[Ogoniok]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko's conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that [[Dark Ages (historiography)#Modern popular use|art and culture died during the Dark Ages]] and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A.

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, Küppers M (2004).

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
{{Biological classification}}
In [[biological classification]], the '''order''' ({{lang-la|ordo}}) is
# a [[taxonomic rank]] used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the [[nomenclature codes]]. Other well-known ranks are [[life]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]], with order fitting in between class and family. An immediately higher rank, '''superorder''', may be added directly above order, while '''suborder''' would be a lower rank.
# a taxonomic unit, a [[taxon]], in that rank. In that case the [[plural]] is orders (Latin ''ordines'').

::''Example'': All [[owls]] belong to the order Strigiformes.

What does and does not belong to each order is determined by a [[taxonomist]], as is whether a particular order should be recognized at all. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a different position. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing or recognizing an order. Some taxa are accepted almost universally, while others are recognised only rarely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Tobin | first1=Allan J. |last2=Dusheck | first2=Jennie | title=Asking About Life | year=2005 | publisher=Cengage Learning | place=Boston | isbn=978-0-030-27044-4 | pp=403–408 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cjgdW4SjoJcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some groups of organisms, consistent suffixes are used to denote that the rank is an order. The Latin [[suffix]] ''-(i)formes'' meaning "having the form of" is used for the [[scientific name]] of orders of [[birds]] and [[fishes]], but not for those of [[mammal]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. The suffix ''-ales'' is for the name of orders of plants, fungi, and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|Article 17.1|ref= McNeill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchy of ranks==

===Zoology===
For some [[clade]]s covered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], a number of additional classifications are sometimes used, although not all of these are officially recognised.

{| class="wikitable sortable"

In their 1997 classification of mammals, McKenna and Bell used two extra levels between superorder and order: "grandorder" and "mirorder".&lt;ref name="McKennaBell1997"&gt;{{Citation |last=McKenna |first=M.C. |last2=Bell |first2=S.G. |year=1997 |title=Classification of Mammals |publication-place=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-11013-6 |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Novacek (1986) inserted them at the same position. [[Michael Benton]] (2005) inserted them between superorder and magnorder instead.&lt;ref name="MichaelJBenton2005_VPalaentology_3rd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Michael J. | year=2005 | title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | edition=3rd | place=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | ISBN=978-0-63205-637-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was adopted by Systema Naturae 2000 and others&lt;!-- example: http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/TaxonTree.aspx?id=67730 (Hexaprotodon liberiensis); example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank --&gt;.

===Botany===
In botany, the ranks of subclass and suborder are secondary ranks pre-defined as respectively above and below the rank of order.&lt;ref name=botarticle4&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|Article 4|ref= McNeill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any number of further ranks can be used as long as they are clearly defined.&lt;ref name=botarticle4/&gt;

The superorder rank is commonly used, with the ending -anae that was initiated by [[Armen Takhtajan]]'s publications from 1966 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Naik, V.N. |year=1984  |title=Taxonomy of Angiosperms |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill  |isbn=9780074517888 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=GanmtXAyU0gC |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The order as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a ''higher [[genus]]'' ''(genus summum))'' was first introduced by the German [[botanist]] [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]] in his classification of plants that appeared in a series of treatises in the 1690s. [[Carl Linnaeus]] was the first to apply it consistently to the division of all three [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of nature ([[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s) in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735, 1st. Ed.).

===Botany===
[[File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the 1758 edition of Linnaeus's ''Systema Naturæ''.&lt;ref name=Linn1758&gt;{{cite book |last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |location=Stockholm |year=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |language=Latin |edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For plants, Linnaeus' orders in the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' were strictly artificial, introduced to subdivide the artificial [[Class (biology)|classes]] into more comprehensible smaller groups.  When the word ''ordo'' was first consistently used for natural units of plants, in 19th century works such as the ''[[de Candolle system|Prodromus]]'' of de Candolle and the ''[[Bentham &amp; Hooker system|Genera Plantarum]]'' of Bentham &amp; Hooker, it indicated [[taxa]] that are now given the rank of family (see ''[[ordo naturalis]]'', ''natural order'').

In French botanical publications, from [[Michel Adanson]]'s ''Familles naturelles des plantes'' (1763) and until the end of the 19th century, the word ''famille'' ([[plural]]: ''familles'') was used as a French equivalent for this Latin ''ordo''. This equivalence was explicitly stated in the [[Alphonse Louis Pierre Pyrame de Candolle|Alphonse De Candolle's]] ''Lois de la nomenclature botanique'' (1868), the precursor of the currently used ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]''.

In the first international ''Rules'' of [[botanical nomenclature]] from the [[International Botanical Congress]] of 1905, the word family (''familia'') was assigned to the rank indicated by the French "famille", while order (''ordo'') was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the 19th century had often been named a ''cohors''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Briquet, J. |year=1912  |title=Règles internationales de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le congrès international de botanique de Vienne 1905, deuxième edition mise au point d'après les décisions du congrès international de botanique de Bruxelles 1910; International rules of botanical nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congresses of Vienna 1905 and Brussels 1910; Internationale Regeln der botanischen Nomenclatur angenommen von den Internationalen Botanischen Kongressen zu Wien 1905 und Brüssel 1910 |publisher=Gustav Fischer |location=Jena |url=https://archive.org/details/rglesinternati00inteuoft}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (plural ''cohortes'').

Some of the plant families still retain the names of Linnaean "natural orders" or even the names of pre-Linnaean natural groups recognised by Linnaeus as orders in his natural classification (e.g. ''Palmae'' or ''Labiatae''). Such names are known as [[Descriptive botanical names|descriptive]] family names.

===Zoology===
In [[zoology]], the Linnaean orders were used more consistently. That is, the orders in the zoology part of the ''Systema Naturae'' refer to natural groups. Some of his ordinal names are still in use (e.g. [[Lepidoptera]] for the order of [[moth]]s and [[Butterfly|butterflies]], or [[Diptera]] for the order of [[Fly|flies]], [[mosquito]]es, [[midge]]s, and [[gnat]]s). {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Virology===
In [[virology]], the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'s [[virus classification]] includes fifteen taxa: realm, subrealm, kingdom, subkingdom, phylum, subphylum, class, subclass, order, suborder, family, subfamily, genus, subgenus, and species, to be applied for viruses, viroids and  satellite nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=ICTV_2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/information/w/ictv-information/383/ictv-code|title=ICTV Code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4577">The '''Petkau effect''' is an early counterexample to linear-effect assumptions usually made about [[radiation]] exposure. It was found by Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Abram Petkau]] at the [[Atomic Energy of Canada]] [[Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment]], [[Manitoba]] and published in Health Physics March 1972.&lt;ref name=Petkau&gt;{{Cite journal

| doi=10.1097/00004032-197203000-00004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Petkau effect was coined by Swiss nuclear hazards commentator Ralph Graeub in 1985 in this book ''Der Petkau-Effekt und unsere strahlende Zukunft'' (The Petkau effect and our Radiating Future).&lt;ref name=Graeub&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petkau had been measuring, in the usual way, the radiation dose that would rupture a simulated artificial [[cell membrane]]. He found that 3500&amp;nbsp;[[rad (unit)|rad]]s delivered in {{frac|2|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;hours (26&amp;nbsp;rad/min  =  15.5&amp;nbsp;Sv/h) would do it.&lt;ref name=Petkau2&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 49

| pages = 1187
| last = Petkau
| first = A.
| title = Radiation Effect with a Model Lipid Membrane
| journal = Canadian Journal of Chemistry
| year = 1971
| doi=10.1139/v71-196
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, almost by chance, Petkau repeated the experiment with much weaker radiation and found that 0.7&amp;nbsp;rad delivered in {{frac|11|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;hours (1&amp;nbsp;millirad/min = 0.61&amp;nbsp;mSv/h) also ruptured the membrane. This was counter to the prevailing assumption of a linear relationship between total dose or dose rate and the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Djurovic, Branka, MD, PhD, "Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation", Slide 15, [[Military Medical Academy (Serbia)|Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The radiation was of ionizing nature, and produced negative [[oxygen]] [[ion]]s (free radicals). Those ions were more damaging to the simulated membrane in lower [[concentration]]s than higher (a somewhat counter-intuitive result in itself) because in the latter, they more readily recombine with each other instead of interfering with the membrane. The ion concentration directly correlated with the radiation dose rate and the composition had [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] consequences.

==Radio-protective effects of superoxide dismutase==

Petkau conducted further experiments with simulated cells in 1976 and found that the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] protected the cells from free radicals generated by ionizing radiation, obviating the effects seen in his earlier experiment.&lt;ref name=Petkau4&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''politico-media complex''' ( '''PMC''', also referred to as the '''political-media complex''' ) is a name that has been given to the close, systematized, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]-like network&lt;ref name="network"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hacking reveals power network|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14846456 |publisher=[[The BBC]]|date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2011|quote=The story of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal has revealed a web of links between senior figures within politics, the police and the media.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of relationships between a [[Sovereign state|state's]] [[politics|political]] and [[ruling class]]es, its [[media industry]], and any interactions with or dependencies upon [[interest group]]s with other domains and agencies, such as [[law]] (and its enforcement through the [[police]]&lt;ref name="filkin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Filkin report: Police warned over press links|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16411329 |publisher=[[The BBC]] |date=January 4, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2012|quote=The "close relationship" between parts of Scotland Yard and the media has caused "serious harm", a report says.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[corporation]]s and the [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]].

There is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of "traditional" [[mainstream media]] [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="lse0"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early media institutions==
Before [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. [[Town criers]] spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Media History |last=Fellow |first=Anthony |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Rosenberg |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-495-56775-2 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7THGKyvBXScC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=%22town+criers%22+polical+media&amp;ei=3IgcS67kN57IzAT2k5iEDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. [[Corantos]], which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Catherine.

==Print==

===Global print media===
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights". United Nations. 2009. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ UN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the international papers present in the world today are national papers re-edited for a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Because of this, there can be biases based on nationality.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In any publication there is some sort of bias just from what news is covered and what stories are shown at the forefront of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Tunstall, Jeremy. pg 12.

Although print media in the West has suffered from declining advertising trends,&lt;ref name="printdecline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fontevecchia | first=Agustino | title=New York Times Agonizes As Print Media Ad Revenues Continue To Slide | website=Forbes | date=12 September 2011 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2011/09/12/new-york-times-agonizes-as-print-media-ad-revenues-continue-to-slide/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; many newspapers and magazines in the [[Middle East]] continue to do well.&lt;ref&gt;"Middle East Newspapers Struggle in New Age".

Routledge. New York. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the independence from political influence, and dependability of newsprint is questionable in many countries. The [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="press freedom index"&gt;"Press Freedom Index 2009".

====The West====
[[File:Newspapers-20080928.jpg|thumb|[[Newspapers]], as seen here, are easily available in many parts of the world.]]

Newspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Caroline. Ross, Karen. “Women and media: international perspectives”. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters Without Borders, an international [[non-governmental organization]] that promotes [[freedom of the press]], produces an annual [[Press Freedom Index]] assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, "It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us."&lt;ref name="press freedom index"/&gt;

====Asia====
The press is censored in the People's Republic of China by the [[Golden Shield Project]], known colloquially as the [[Great Firewall of China]].&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Sentinel: News Media and Governance Reform |last=Norris |first=Pippa |authorlink=Pippa Norris |author2=World Bank Staff |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Bank Publications]] |location= |isbn=978-0-8213-8200-4 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzFVxDDhfnkC&amp;pg=PA360 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reporters Without Borders'' ranks [[Media of the People's Republic of China|China's press situation]] as "very serious," the worst possible ranking on their five-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;"The News by Country".

====The Middle East and North Africa====
Middle Eastern print media is mainly paid for by private funders, either a specific family or specific government party.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines have been accused of having obvious political ties.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. pg 11. The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years. Britain.

===Struggles===
Where newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan, Robert. The Krugman Paradox: newspaper websites' inability to generate economically sustainable advertising revenue. New York University. Fall 2008. pg. 18.[http://metaprinter.com/Projects/Robert_Ivan_MAthesis_2008NYU.pdf MA Thesis PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, [[print press]] has been described as declining.&lt;ref name="printdecline" /&gt; Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|title=Conservative Koch Brothers Turning Focus to Newspapers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/business/media/koch-brothers-making-play-for-tribunes-newspapers.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are "isolated and out of touch" and motivated by commercial interests.&lt;ref name="2004att"&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/public-attitudes/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt;

Some{{who|date=June 2013}} have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. [[Harvard]] Professor Thomas Patterson has said: "What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both. My sense is that, like it or not, the future of news is going to be in the electronic media, but we don't really know what that form is going to look like."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Juston. "Young Adults Are Giving Newspapers Scant Notice". July 16, 2007. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/business/media/16habits.html?_r=0 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==

===History of political radio===
[[File:RCA Radiola 25 - raw.jpg|thumb|An [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] Radiola, manufactured 1925.]]

The early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Douglas B. Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States. pg 26. The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the [[Radio Act of 1912]], which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Regulate Radio Communication, August 13, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation,{{OR|date=June 2013}} including the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which established the [[Federal Radio Commission]] and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 632, February 23, 1927, 69th Congress. An Act for the regulation of radio communications, and for other purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. [[Jonathan Reed Winkler]], a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.”&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Jonathan Reed. Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I. pg. 2. [[Harvard University Press]]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pgs. 10, 13-16. [[Columbia University Press]]. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924{{OR|date=June 2013}} when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pg. 18. Columbia University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of radio users exploded, by 1935 about 2 in 3 American homes owned a radio.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, Steven E. "Golden Age of Radio,1935-1950" [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/radio2.html Sandiego.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians quickly learned to reach these huge audiences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [[Fireside Chats]] are an example of the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In his series of informal broadcasts from 1933 to 1944, Roosevelt developed a comforting rapport with the American public.&lt;ref&gt;"Treasures of American History: The Great Depression and World War II."

[http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?key=1267&amp;exkey=143&amp;pagekey=246 SI.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The Fireside Chats enabled the President to communicate directly to the public through one of the most popular media outlets of the time. Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of [[propaganda]]. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as [[Tokyo Rose]]. These women hosted anti-American programming intended to lower American soldiers' morale and illustrate the use of governments' use of the media to influence the public, or their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;"Famous Cases: Iva Toguri d'Aquino and 'Tokyo Rose.'" The Federal Bureau of Investigation. [https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/rose/rose.htm FBI.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people, such as [[Iva Toguri D'Aquino]] and Allied prisoners of war, were forced against their will to participate in these programs and worked hard to help Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iva Toguri|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article652271.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Willis Conover 1969.jpg|thumb|left|[[Willis Conover]], host of the [[Voice of America|VOA's]] Music USA program, 1969.]]
After WWII and throughout the [[Cold War]] era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the [[Voice of America]], founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era "public diplomacy," which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon Robert. "Channeling the Cold War: U.S. Overseas Broadcasting". The Foreign Service Journal. pg. 58. October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, President Harry S. Truman described the Cold War conflict as a "struggle, above all else, for the minds of men," which the American people would win by getting "the real story across to people in other countries." in other words, embracing the politico-media complex and using it to influence foreign listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Lyn. McLean, David. Media and Society in the Twentieth Century: a historical introduction. pg. 107. Wiley Blackwell. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice of America, operating under the authority of the [[United States Information Agency]], supported programming in forty five languages, broadcasting over 400 hours of programming a week. Programming included unbiased news coverage, musical programs, and [[Special English]] broadcasts, which intended to help listeners master American English.&lt;ref&gt;Voice of America in the Postwar Years. About VOA. [http://www.voanews.com/english/About/2007-Post-WWII-history.cfm Voanews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The VOA was not alone in its international broadcasting efforts, the United States Central Intelligence Agency supported [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty]], both propagandist radio networks intended to incite dissent against Communism.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Arch. Broadcasting Freedom: The Cold War Triumph of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. pg. ix. [[University Press of Kentucky]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations also used international radio as propaganda, for example, [[Deutsche Welle]], the German international radio program was a major broadcaster during the Cold War. By 1965 DW was airing 848 hours of programming to the Soviet Union and abroad and reached 5% of the USSR population weekly by 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James.

===Modern political radio===
The Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the [[Rush Limbaugh Show]], which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as "America's Truth Detector," the "Doctor of Democracy," and the "Most Dangerous Man in America."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rush Limbaugh Show." Premier Radio Networks. [http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/about_the_show.guest.html RushLimbaugh.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rush Limbaugh Show has hosted numerous politicians, illustrating that politicians still use the radio to affect public opinion and the political process.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} The [[Air America Media]] company, provides progressive political commentary and news coverage and has described itself as the "most recognized progressive talk radio network, providing an independent and unfiltered voice to a grateful listening nation."&lt;ref&gt;"About Air America." [http://AirAmerica.com/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Air America programs such as [[The Rachel Maddow Show (radio)|The Rachel Maddow Show]], The Lionel Show, and Live in Washington with Jack Rice discuss recordings of politicians, host politicians as live guests, and act as a connection between the political classes and the media.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rachel Maddow Show", [http://airamerica.com/therachelmaddowshow/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"About the Lionel Show" [http://airamerica.com/lionel/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"About Live in Washington with Jack Rice" [http://airamerica.com/liveinmwashingtonwithjackrice/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==

===National cinema===
One of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is '''[[national cinema]]''', for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, Mette, and Scott MacKenzie, eds. Introduction. ''Cinema and Nation''. By Hjort and MacKenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jimmy. "Is National Cinema Mr. MacGuffin?" International Films The Institute of Communications Studies, [[University of Leeds]], UK. Available at [http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22 Leeds.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, Charles and John A. Hall. "The Sociological Scope of National Cinema." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p.22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural politics===
Ulf Hedetoft has observed, "In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"&gt;Hedetoft, Ulf. "Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its "national-cultural currency" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a "positive admixture" to other countries' cultures and identities or a "model for emulation."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt; He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt;

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"&gt;Furhammar, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

Such British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the "masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from "[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]
When sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{OR|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"&gt;Furhammar, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the "reality" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The Führer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.&lt;ref&gt;Furhammar, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in "Breaking into the Movies," is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"&gt;Giroux, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, "We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values."&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"/&gt;

Though feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"/&gt;

===Anti-politics in film===
Despite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to "develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's "[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]" 1939.]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; After the hero of ''[[John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Lindholm and Hall observe that "the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"&gt;Lindholm, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt; Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt;

===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===
While films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

===Role of television in United States presidential elections===
The [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"&gt;Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;

Rick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that "politicians have repeatedly misled voters" by "[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation."&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;
[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]

Through setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.&lt;ref name="agenda" /&gt; When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence on religion via television===
In his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in "shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present" in India.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;Rajagopal, Arvind. "Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India." Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that "television profoundly changes the context of politics".&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;24)&lt;/sup&gt;

The epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/sup&gt; This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.

Central to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt; This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.

===Television and politics around the world===
In the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"&gt;Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"/&gt;

Another group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are "conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information."&lt;ref&gt;Neuman et al., 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;60&lt;/ref&gt; They set the parameters "in which citizens discuss public events."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;IV&lt;/ref&gt; They are "persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Framing is selecting "some aspects of a perceived reality" to enhance their salience "in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt; Frames are to help audiences "locate, perceive, identify, and label" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;21 and to "narrow the available political alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Semetko"&gt;Semetko, Holli A. and Valenburg, Patti M. “Framing European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.” Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

News frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&amp;nbsp;– such as its organization, content, or structure&amp;nbsp;– make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Price et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;486&lt;/ref&gt; Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;

Like agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis "expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news."&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan &amp; Kosicki, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;70; emphasis in the original&lt;/ref&gt; The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt; After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.

==Internet==

===Impact on political media===
The Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&amp;pg=PT350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).

The impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton (square).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bill Clinton]] was the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] to utilize the [[Internet]] in a national campaign and to appoint a Director of Email and Electronic Publishing.]]
[[E-mail]] has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Media and American Politics |last=Davis |first=Richard |author2=Owen, Diana |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-512060-4 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-Ka0nSKaFoC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=New+Media+and+American+Politics#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
The United States [[President of the United States|Presidential]] [[United States presidential election, 1996|campaign]] in 1996 between sitting-President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

With so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] United States [[Presidential election]] between [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]], the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. [[Facebook]], an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Discussion forums===
[[Blogs]] are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many [[political campaign]]s use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.&lt;ref name=Tremayne &gt;{{cite book |title=Blogging, Citizenship, and the future of media |last=Tremayne |first=Mark |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group, LLC |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-97940-4 |page=266 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a6zPnOn9i9oC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.&lt;ref name=Tremayne/&gt;

===Electronic government===
An [[e-Government]] is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netzhausen.de/internet/indage_bureaucracy_final.pdf |title= The Digital Economy: Promise &amp; Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence

==UK media phone hacking scandal==
{{Main article|News International phone hacking scandal}}
In perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1534 Column 1534]. ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We politicians have colluded for far too long with the media: we rely on them, we seek their favour, and we live and we die politically because of what they write and what they show, and sometimes that means we lack the courage or the spine to stand up when wrong has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Chris Bryant]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1540 Column 1540] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*As MPs, we depend on the media. We like to be liked by them; we need to be liked by them. We depend on the media, and that applies still more to Governments. It is an unavoidable observation that Parliament has behaved with extraordinary cowardice for many years...&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Zac Goldsmith]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1569 Column 1569] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We are faced with a scandal of expanding proportions, including hacking, allegations of interference in police investigations, and claims that payments have been made to officers. To restore faith and trust in the police and the media, we must lock up the guilty, establish a statutory inquiry, shine a cleansing light on the culture of the media and, if necessary, of the police, and implement the reforms necessary to ensure that the privacy of victims and citizens is never intruded on again. It is clear from today’s debate that this is the will of the House, and we are committed to making it happen.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Tom Brake]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0003.htm/#column_1580 Column 1580] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of  (the UK) parliament and those that form the [[UK Government]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and [[News International]] (NI [UK subsidiary of [[News Corporation]] ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.

The debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the ''[[News of the World]]'' (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘[[News of the World phone hacking affair|phone hacking affair]]’, the consequences&lt;ref&gt;The first major consequence being the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14070856 closure] of the 168 year old title of the ''News of the World'' from Sunday 10 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after [[The Walt Disney Company]]) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.&lt;ref name="lse1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson Round-Up: Over Cosy?

==Noam Chomsky reaction==
Naming (as a 'complex')  points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident [[Noam Chomsky]]. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the "two sectors" represent an "innocent fraud")&lt;ref name="galbraith"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May–June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget. That's a very fairly central theme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has blamed its existence on the [[corporate welfare|"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits"]].

Chomsky discusses the ''[[military-industrial complex]]'' (MIC)&lt;ref name="chomsky1"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Barsamian|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|work=International Socialist Review|issue=37|date=September–October 2004|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=...the military-industrial complex, as he (Eisenhower) called it, is actually the core of the modern economy. It’s not specifically military.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the "military" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.

Using the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.

Observing the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).

Chomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.

Chomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.

[[Edward S. Herman]] and Chomsky, together, advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' to accomplish this '[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|manufacturing consent]]', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news."&lt;ref name="orwell"&gt;{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.

Herman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.

Thus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.&lt;ref name="chomsky2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

The shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the ''News of the World'', when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.&lt;ref name="nowad"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon|last=Rogers|title=Top 50 News of the World advertisers - and what they spend|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/06/news-of-the-world-top-50-advertisers-spend |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Mason|title=Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14093772|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011|quote=The ''News of the World'' is closing - at least partly due to a strong campaign to make advertisers drop the title, following the latest phone hacking revelations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">In mathematics,  '''primitive recursive set functions''' or  '''primitive recursive ordinal functions''' are analogs of [[primitive recursive function]]s, defined for sets or ordinals rather than natural numbers. They were introduced by {{harvtxt|Jensen|Karp|1971}}.

==Definition==

A primitive recursive set function is a function from sets to sets that can be obtained from the following basic functions by repeatedly applying the following rules of substitution and recursion:

The basic functions are:
*Projection: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;
*Zero: ''F''(''x'') = 0
*[[Axiom of adjunction|Adjoining an element to a set]]: ''F''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' ∪ {''y''}
*Testing membership: ''C''(''x'',''y'',''u'',''v'') = ''x'' if ''u'' ∈ ''v'', ''y'' otherwise.

The rules for generating new functions by substitution are
*''F''('''x''','''y''') = ''G''('''x''',''H''('''x'''),'''y''')
*''F''('''x''','''y''') = ''G''(''H''('''x'''),'''y''')
where '''x''' and '''y''' are finite sequences of variables.

The rule for generating new functions by recursion is
*''F''(''z'','''x''') = ''G''(∪&lt;sub&gt;''u''∈''z''&lt;/sub&gt;''F''(''u'','''x'''),''z'','''x''')

A primitive recursive ordinal function is defined in the same way, except that the initial function ''F''(''x'',''y'') = ''x''∪{''y''} is replaced by ''F''(''x'') = ''x''∪{''x''} (the successor of ''x''). The primitive recursive ordinal functions are the same as the primitive recursive set functions that map ordinals to ordinals.

One can also add more initial functions to obtain a larger class of functions. For example, the ordinal function ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is not primitive recursive, because the constant function with value ω (or any other infinite set) is not primitive recursive, so one might want to add this constant function to the initial functions.

In [[botany|plant biology]], [[protease inhibitor (biology)|proteinase inhibitors]] are a family of small [[protein]]s that serve an integral role in the plant’s defense mechanisms against [[Herbivore#Definition and related terms|herbivory]] from [[insect]]s or [[microorganism]]s that may compromise the integrity of the plant. Proteinase inhibitors are present in all plants and are highly concentrated in the storage tissues of the plant as well as portions of the plant that have suffered damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habib|first=Huma|last2=Fazili|first2=Khalid|date=August 2007|title=Plant protease inhibitors: a defense strategy in plants|url=https://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380100578_Habeeb%20and%20Khalid.pdf|journal=Biotechnology and Molecular Biology Review|volume=2|issue=3|pages=68–85|via=Academic Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work to disrupt the enzymatic ability of the [[digestive enzyme|digestive]] or microbial [[enzymes]] that are present in the [[stomach]] of the attacker resulting in the inability to properly [[digestion|digest]] the plant material. This causes an interference of proper growth and discourages further wounding of the plant by the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Shu-Guo|last2=Wu|first2=Guo-Jiang|date=2005|title=Characteristics of plant proteinase inhibitors and their applications in combating phytophagous insects|url=https://ejournal.sinica.edu.tw/bbas/content/2005/4/Bot464-01.html|journal=Botanical Bulletin of Academia Sinica|volume=46|pages=273–292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also recently{{when|date=June 2018}} revealed that some proteinase inhibitors also provide defense for the plant through the possession of [[antimicrobial]] properties providing for the inhibition of [[pathogen]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim JY, Park SC, Hwang I, Cheong H, Nah JW, Hahm KS, Park Y | title = Protease inhibitors from plants with antimicrobial activity | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 2860–72 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19582234 | pmc = 2705521 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10062860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While proteinase inhibitors are present in plants naturally, production of these proteins for defense is often induced by either wounding of the plant or by chemical signaling through molecules such as [[methyl jasmonate]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=E. E.|last2=Ryan|first2=C. A.|date=1990-10-01|title=Interplant communication: airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves.|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.87.19.7713|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=87|issue=19|pages=7713–7716|doi=10.1073/pnas.87.19.7713|pmc=54818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both wounding of the plant as well as signaling molecules result in the formation of [[jasmonic acid]], which then induces the [[gene expression]] of proteinase inhibitors. Many other signal cascades as well as the [[Translocation (botany)|translocation]] of signal molecules through the [[phloem]] and [[xylem]] of the plant are also necessary for the production of these inhibitors. Once the proteinase inhibitor has been ingested by the insect, it presents itself as a normal [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] for the digestive enzymes binding to the active site on the enzyme. This binding of the inhibitor to the proteinase creates a new complex that is very unlikely to dissociate. Once bound, the active site can no longer be accessed by any other substrate and the enzyme can no longer digest the [[amino acid]]s of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Paulraj|last2=Koundal|first2=Kripa|date=April 15, 2002|title=Plant protease inhibitors in control of phytophagous insects|url=http://www.ejbiotechnology.info/index.php/ejbiotechnology/article/view/v5n1-3/947|journal=Plant Biotechnology|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.2225/vol5-issue1-fulltext-3|via=Electronic Journal of Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without proper digestion, the insect is unable to grow, and may starve if it chooses to remain at the wounded plant. Similar inhibition of growth can be seen in pathogens that interact with these inhibitors.

In order to discover how the production of the inhibitors was induced, scientists exposed [[tomato]] plants to different forms of methyl jasmonate and then [[assay]]ed using [[radial immunodiffusion]] for proteinase inhibitors in leaf juices. A group of tomato plants was sprayed with a solution containing methyl jasmonate, while another group of tomato plants was exposed to methyl jasmonate vapor in air-tight glass chambers. [[Treatment and control groups|Control groups]] were sprayed with a solution or exposed to a vapor that did not contain methyl jasmonate. Both [[Treatment and control groups|experimental groups]] revealed increased proteinase inhibitor production as a result of exposure to [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] methyl jasmonate in comparison to control groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The production of proteinase inhibitors reveals that plants have the ability to alter their defense behavior in response to a threat or direct attack on plant integrity. This complex defense mechanism serves to not only protect the plant from being eaten, but also from pathogen infection requiring both coordination and communication.

[[Radium]] and [[radon]] are important contributors to [[environmental radioactivity]]. Radon occurs naturally in the environment as a result of decay of [[radioactive]] elements in the soil and it can accumulate in houses built on areas where such decay occurs. This radon is among major causes of cancer, estimated to contribute to about 2% of all cancer related deaths in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Radon in homes and risk of lung cancer: collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 European case-control studies|last = Darby|date = January 29, 2005|journal = British Medical Journal|volume = 330|issue = 7485|page = 223|doi = 10.1136/bmj.38308.477650.63|pmid = 15613366|pmc=546066|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radium, like radon, is a radioactive element and it is found in small quantities in nature and may thus be hazardous to life if concentrated. Radium has its origins as a decay product of certain isotopes of uranium and [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby et al. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Radium may also be released to the environment as a result of human activity, for example, in inproperly discarded products painted with radioluminescent paint.

== Radium ==

===In the oil and gas industries ===

Residues from the [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] industry often contain [[radium]] and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich. It is the case that the water inside an oil field is often very rich in [[strontium]], [[barium]] and [[radium]] while seawater is very rich in [[sulfate]] so if water from an oil well is discharged into the sea or mixed with seawater the radium is likely to be brought out of solution by the barium/strontium sulfate which acts as a [[Catalyst|carrier]] precipitate.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Toxicological Profile for Radon|last = Keith|first =S|publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (US)|date=May 2012|isbn = |location = Atlanta (GA) |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radioluminescent products, ie glow in the dark ===

Local contamination from radium-based [[Radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] paints having been improperly disposed of is not unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Radium Corp. |location=New Jersey |id=EPA ID#: NJD980654172 |title=EPA REGION 2, Congressional District(s): 10, Essex, City of Orange |date=February 5, 2010 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714234109/http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/0200772c.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In radioactive quackery ===

[[Eben Byers]] was a wealthy American socialite whose death in 1932 as a result of using an [[radioactive quackery]] product called [[Radithor]] is a prominent example of a death caused by radium. Radithor contained approximately 1 μCi (40 MBq) of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra and 1 μCi of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra per bottle. Radithor was taken by mouth and radium, being a [[calcium]] mimic, has a very long [[biological halflife]] in [[bone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/82/21/1667.extract#|title = Radiation Therapy Pursuit Leads to Unearthing of "Hot Bones"|last = Vanchieri|first = Cori|date = November 7, 1990|journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute|doi = 10.1093/jnci/82.21.1667|pmid = |access-date = January 31, 2015|volume=82|issue=21|page=1667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radon ==

[[File:Radon decay in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|[[Radon]] in air forms a part of the [[background radiation]], which can be observed in a [[cloud chamber]]]]
The majority of the dose is caused by the decay of the [[polonium]] (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po) and [[lead]] (&lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) daughters of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn.  By controlling exposure to the daughters the radioactive dose to the [[skin]] and [[lung]]s can be reduced by at least 90%. This can be done by wearing a dust mask, and wearing a suit to cover the entire body. Note that exposure to [[smoke]] at the same time as [[radon]] and radon daughters will increase the harmful effect of the radon. In [[uranium mining|uranium miner]]s radon has been found to be more [[carcinogenic]] in [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] than in non-smokers.&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;

=== Occurrence===

Radon concentration in the open air varies between 1 and 100 Bq per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Daily variation of the radon concentration indoors and outdoors and the influence of meteorological parameters.|last = Porstendörfer|first =J.|date = September 1994|journal = Health physics|doi = 10.1097/00004032-199409000-00011|pmid = 8056597|volume=67|issue=3|pages=283–287|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon can be found in some [[spring (water)|spring water]]s and [[hot spring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of the exposure levels to radioactivity in the hot-spring environment of the Island of Ischia during a year|last = Bartoli|first = G.|date = 1989|journal = Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunità|doi = |pmid = 2484503|volume=1|issue=6|pages=1781–1823|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towns of [[Misasa, Tottori|Misasa]], [[Japan]], and [[Bad Kreuznach]], [[Germany]] boast radium-rich springs which emit radon, as does [[Radium Springs, New Mexico]].

Radon exhausts naturally from the ground, particularly in certain regions, especially but not only regions with [[granite|granitic]] soils. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon, for instance while the rock which [[Aberdeen]] is on is very radium rich the rock lacks the cracks required for the radon to migrate. In other nearby areas of Scotland (to the north of Aberdeen) and in [[Cornwall]]/[[Devon]] the radon is very much able to leave the rock.

Radon is a decay product of [[radium]] which in turn is a decay product of uranium. It is possible to acquire maps of average radon levels in houses to assist in the planning of radon mitigation measures for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/IEP/high-radon/USgm.htm |title=Predicted median annual-average living-area concentration, by county |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231195400/http://eetd.lbl.gov/IEP/high-radon/USgm.htm |archivedate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while high uranium in the [[soil]]/[[Rock (geology)|rock]] under a house does not always lead to a high radon level in air, a positive correlation between the uranium content of the soil and the radon level in air can be seen.

===In air ===

Radon is related to [[indoor air quality]] as it blights many homes. (See "Radon in Houses" below.)

The radon (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn) released into the air decays to [[lead|&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]] and other radioisotopes and the levels of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb can be measured. It is important to note that the rate of deposition of this radioisotope is very dependent on the season. Here is a graph of the deposition rate observed in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X05002432 |title= Seasonal and spatial variation of atmospheric 210Pb and 7Be deposition: features of the Japan Sea side of Japan |last= Yamamoto |first= Masayoshi |date= September 21, 2005 |journal= Journal of Environmental Radioactivity |doi= 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.08.001 |pmid= 16181712 |access-date= January 31, 2015 |issue=1 |pages=110–131 |volume=86 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lead210inairatjapan.png|upright=2|thumb|Lead-210 deposition rate as a function of time as observed in Japan]]

===In groundwater===

Well water can be very rich in radon; the use of this water inside a house is an additional route allowing radon to enter the house. The radon can enter the air and then be a source of exposure to the humans, or the water can be consumed by humans which is a different exposure route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |title= Basic Information about Radon in Drinking Water |date= June 30, 2014 |accessdate= January 31, 2015 |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214054459/http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radon in rainwater===
Rainwater can be intensely radioactive due to high levels of radon and its decay progenies &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Bi and &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb; the concentrations of these [[radioisotope]]s can be high enough to seriously disrupt radiation monitoring at nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=Yamazawa&gt;{{Cite conference

===In the oil and gas industries ===

The water, oil and gas from a well often contains [[radon]]. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where [[propane]] is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Survey &amp; Identification of NORM Contaminated Equipment |url=http://www.enprotec-inc.com/Presentations/NORM.pdf |publisher=Enprotec / Hibbs &amp; Todd |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mines ===

Because uranium minerals emit [[radon]] gas, and their harmful and highly radioactive [[decay product|daughter products]], uranium mining is considerably more dangerous than other (already dangerous) [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]], requiring adequate ventilation systems if the mines are not [[open-pit mining|open pit]]. During the 1950s, a significant number of American uranium miners were [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] Indians, as many uranium deposits were discovered on Navajo [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. A statistically significant subset of these miners later developed [[small-cell lung cancer]], a type of cancer usually not associated with smoking, after exposure to uranium ore and [[radon]]-222, a natural decay product of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gottlieb |first=Leon S. |last2=Husen |first2=Luverne A. |title=Lung Cancer Among Navajo Uranium Miners |date=April 1982 |journal=Chest |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=449–452 |doi=10.1378/chest.81.4.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radon, which is produced by the uranium, and not the uranium itself has been shown to be the cancer causing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Harley |first=Naomi |date=1999 |last2=Foulkes |first2=Ernest |last3=Hilborne |first3=Lee H. |last4=Hudson |first4=Arlene |last5=Anthony |first5=C.

Currently the level of radon in the air of mines is normally controlled by [[law]]. In a working mine, the radon level can be controlled by [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], sealing off old workings and controlling the water in the mine. The level in a mine can go up when a mine is abandoned, it can reach a level which is able to cause the [[skin]] to become [[red]] (a mild [[radiation burn]]). The radon levels in some of the mines can reach 400 to 700 kBq m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of health risks to skin and lung of elevated radon levels in abandoned mines.|last = Denman|first = A.R.|date = December 2003|journal = Health Physics|doi = 10.1097/00004032-200312000-00018|pmid = 14626324|last2 = Eatough|first2 = J.P.|first3 = G.|first4 = P.S.|last3 = Gillmore|last4 = Phillips|issue = 6|pages = 733–739|volume=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common unit of exposure of lung tissue to [[alpha emitter]]s is the [[Working level|working level month]] ('''WLM'''), this is where the human [[lung]]s have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products). This is air which has the alpha dose rate of 1 [[working level]] ('''WL'''). It is estimated that the average person (''[[general public]]'') is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]]), while the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 μSv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation, and Nuclear Energy|last = Hala|first = Jiri|publisher = Konvoj|year = 2003|isbn = 9788073020538|location = |pages = |last2 = Navratil|first2 = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans a relationship between [[lung cancer]] and radon has been shown to exist (beyond all reasonable doubt) for exposures of 100 WLM and above. By using the data from several studies it has been possible to show that an increased risk can be caused by a dose as low as 15 to 20 WLM. Sadly these studies have been difficult as the random errors in the data are very large. It is likely that the miners are also subject to other effects which can harm their lungs while at work (for example dust and [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] fumes).

===In houses ===

The fact that radon is present in indoor air has been known at least since 1950s and research on its effects on human health started on early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol43/|title = Man-made Mineral Fibres and Radon|date = 1988|journal = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 31, 2015|issue = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of radon exposure in [[dwellings]] received more widespread public awareness after 1984, as a result of a case of [[Health effects of radon#Stanley Watras|Stanley Watras]], an employee at the [[Limerick nuclear power plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Indoor radon and lung cancer. Estimating the risks.|last = Samet|first = J. M.|date = January 1992|journal = Western Journal of Medicine|doi = |pmid = 1734594|pmc=1003141|volume=156|issue=1|pages=25–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Watras set off the [[radiation]] alarms (see [[Geiger counter]]) on his way ''into'' work for two weeks straight while authorities searched for the source of the [[contamination]]. They were shocked to find that the source was astonishingly high levels of radon in his [[basement]] and it was not related to the nuclear plant.

Depending on how houses are built and ventilated, radon may accumulate in basements and dwellings. The [[European Union]] recommends that [[Radon mitigation|mitigation]] should be taken starting from concentrations of 400&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for old houses, and 200&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for new ones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.polisproject.org/PDFs/Radon%20report%20DSF.doc|title = Radon The Unfamiliar Killer|last = Boyd|first = David R.|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = February 1, 2015|publisher = David Suzuki Foundation|year = 2006|series = Healthy Environment, Healthy Canadians Series, Report No.1|location = Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 8&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|pCi]]/L (300 Bq/m³).

The [[United States]] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 148&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (given as 4&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|pCi]]/L). Nearly one in 15 homes in the U.S. has a high level of indoor radon according to their statistics. The U.S. Surgeon General and EPA recommend all homes be tested for radon. Since 1985, millions of homes have been tested for radon in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By adding a crawl space under the ground floor, which is subject to forced ventilation the radon level in the house can be lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Design and Testing of Sub-Slab Depressurization for Radon Mitigation in North Florida Houses: Part I - Performance and Durability|last = Roessler|first = C.

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3438">'''Sinop D''' is an ancient [[Ancient Black Sea shipwrecks|Black Sea shipwreck]] located to the east of [[Sinop, Turkey]]. The ship was discovered by a team led by [[Robert Ballard]] in 2000. The team discovered the well-preserved wreck at a 320m depth, in the [[Black Sea]]'s deep [[anoxic waters]]. The vessel's entire [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and cargo are intact, buried in sediments. Its deck structures are also intact, including a [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] rising some 11 m into the water column. Radiocarbon dating of wood from the wreck provides a date of  410-520 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/07blacksea/background/plan/plan.html NOAA Aegean and Black Sea Expedition 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
In 2000, Ballard and his team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15-30km west of Sinop, and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula. Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, they examined the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the [[Crimea]] indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains.

The wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the Black Sea during a period of political, social and economic transition through their study of the ship’s construction techniques. Studies show that long-distance trading had developed in Sinop as early as 4500 BC. Sea-trading on the Black Sea was most intense during the period of [[late antiquity]], between the 2nd and 7th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., 2001, Black Sea coastal cultures: trade and interaction, Expedition 43: 11-20&lt;/ref&gt; Sinop D provides direct evidence for Black Sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land.

Sinop D provided Ballard and his team with an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction during a time of transition. When observing the sonar signature of Sinop D, a long, slender upright feature on the sea-bed transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200m below the surface. There are currently few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together, as the bulk of the ship remains buried in sediments. There are no [[mortise and tenon]] fastenings, and no sewing. Sinop D was originally thought to be one of the earliest [[lateen]]-rigged ships available to be studied by archaeologists. However, a 2007 expedition to the site identified what is now believed to be a mast for an [[Headsail|artemon]], which would suggest a different type of vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/2ndPeoples2008.pdf Deepwater investigations of two Byzantine shipwrecks, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; New technology is currently in development that will allow more thorough and preservative excavations to take place.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{farming}}
'''Sustainable agriculture''' is [[agriculture |farming]] in [[sustainability |sustainable]] ways based on an understanding of [[ecosystem services]], the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. 

==History of the term==
The phrase 'sustainable agriculture' was reportedly coined by the Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Rural Science Graduates Association | year=2002 | url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html | title={{sic |In Memo |rium |hide=y |expected=In Memoriam}} - Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE | publisher=[[University of New England (Australia) |University of New England]] | accessdate=21 October 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html | archivedate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wes Jackson is credited with the first publication of the expression in his 1980 book ''New Roots for Agriculture''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Wes. ''New Roots for Agriculture''. Foreword by Wendell Berry. University of Nebraska Press. {{ISBN |0803275625}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term became popular in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschenmann, Frederick. [http://www.sehn.org/Volume_9-2.html A Brief History of Sustainable Agriculture], editor's note by Carolyn Raffensperger and Nancy Myers. The Networker, vol. 9, no. 2, March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term", for example to satisfy human food and fiber needs, to enhance [[environmental quality]] and the [[natural resource]] base upon which the agricultural economy depends, to make the most efficient use of [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] and on-farm resources and integrate natural biological cycles and controls, to sustain the economic viability of farm operations, and to enhance the [[quality of life]] for farmers and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M. (July 2009). [https://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/sustainable-agriculture-information-access-tools What is Sustainable Agriculture?]. United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key principles ==
There are several key principles associated with sustainability in agriculture&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pretty|first=Jules|date=2008-02-12|title=Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1491/447|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=363|issue=1491|pages=447–465|doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2163|issn=0962-8436|pmid=17652074|pmc=2610163}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

#The incorporation of biological and ecological processes into agricultural and food production practices. For example, these processes could include [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], [[soil regeneration]], and [[nitrogen fixation]].
#Using decreased amounts of non-renewable and unsustainable inputs, particularly the ones that are environmentally harmful.
#Using the expertise of farmers to both productively work the land as well as to promote the self-reliance and self-sufficiency of farmers.
#Solving agricultural and natural resource problems through the cooperation and collaboration of people with different skills. The problems tackled include [[Pest control|pest management]] and [[irrigation]].

==Farming and natural resources==
[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods had a low [[carbon footprint]].]]

Sustainable agriculture can be understood as an ecosystem approach to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miguel Altieri |Altieri, Miguel A.]] (1995) ''Agroecology: The science of sustainable agriculture''. Westview Press, Boulder, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; Practices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage |tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity |salinization]]). [[Long-term experiments]] have provided some of the best data on how various practices affect soil properties essential to sustainability. In the United States a federal agency, USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, specializes in providing technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation and production agriculture as compatible goals.

[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]

The most important factors for an individual site are sun, air, soil, [[nutrient]]s, and [[water resources |water]]. Of the five, water and [[soil conservation |soil quality]] and quantity are most amenable to human intervention through time and labor.

Although air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water. When farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some of these nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield |yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] (used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertilizer), or mineral ores (e.g., phosphate). Possible sources of nitrogen that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:

#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure |human manure]]
#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation |nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]
#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using electricity (perhaps from solar cells or windmills)) or
#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.

The last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928–4932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.

More realistic, and often overlooked, options include [[shifting cultivation |long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients. Crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices.

=== Water ===

In some areas sufficient [[rainfall]] is available for crop growth, but many other areas require [[irrigation]]. For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity |salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.

Several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in "normal" years with average rainfall. These measures include both policy and management actions:&lt;ref name=sarep&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm |title=What is Sustainable Agriculture? — ASI |publisher=Sarep.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421034222/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm |archivedate=2007-04-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

# improving [[water conservation]] and storage measures,
# providing incentives for selection of [[drought-tolerant]] crop species,
# using reduced-volume irrigation systems,
# managing crops to reduce water loss, and
# not planting crops at all.
 
Indicators for sustainable water resource development are:&lt;ref name=faoWater&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4745e/w4745e0d.htm |title=Indicators for sustainable water resources development |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Internal renewable water resources. This is the average annual flow of rivers and [[groundwater]] generated from endogenous precipitation, after ensuring that there is no double counting. It represents the maximum amount of water resource produced within the boundaries of a country. This value, which is expressed as an average on a yearly basis, is invariant in time (except in the case of proved [[climate change]]). The indicator can be expressed in three different units: in absolute terms (km³/yr), in mm/yr (it is a measure of the [[humidity]] of the country), and as a function of population (m³/person per year).&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;
* Global renewable water resources. This is the sum of internal renewable water resources and incoming flow originating outside the country. Unlike internal resources, this value can vary with time if upstream development reduces [[water resources |water availability]] at the border. Treaties ensuring a specific flow to be reserved from upstream to downstream countries may be taken into account in the computation of global water resources in both countries.&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;
* Dependency ratio. This is the proportion of the global renewable water resources originating outside the country, expressed in percentage. It is an expression of the level to which the water resources of a country depend on neighbouring countries.&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;
* Water withdrawal. In view of the limitations described above, only gross water withdrawal can be computed systematically on a country basis as a measure of water use. Absolute or per-person value of yearly water withdrawal gives a measure of the importance of water in the country's economy. When expressed in percentage of water resources, it shows the degree of pressure on water resources. A rough estimate shows that if water withdrawal exceeds a quarter of global renewable water resources of a country, water can be considered a limiting factor to development and, reciprocally, the pressure on water resources can affect all sectors, from agriculture to environment and fisheries.&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;

=== Soil ===
[[File:Walls against water runoff.JPG|thumb|Walls built to avoid water run-off]]

[[Erosion |Soil erosion]] is fast becoming one of the world's severe problems. It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa |title=CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil erosion is occurring worldwide. The phenomenon is being called ''peak soil'' as present large-scale factory farming techniques are jeopardizing humanity's ability to grow food in the present and in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land |arable soil]] will become increasingly problematic. Intensive agriculture reduces the [[carbon]] level in soil, impairing soil structure, crop growth and ecosystem functioning,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Powlson |first=D.S. |last2=Gregory |first2=P.J. |last3=Whalley |first3=W.R. |last4=Quinton |first4=J.N. |last5=Hopkins |first5=D.W. |last6=Whitmore |first6=A.P. |last7=Hirsch |first7=P.R. |last8=Goulding |first8=K.W.T. |date=2011-01-01 |title=Soil management in relation to sustainable agriculture and ecosystem services |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919210001399 |journal=Food Policy |volume=36 |pages=S72–S87 |doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.11.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accelerating [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Powlson |first=D.S. |last2=Gregory |first2=P.J. |last3=Whalley |first3=W.R. |last4=Quinton |first4=J.N. |last5=Hopkins |first5=D.W. |last6=Whitmore |first6=A.P. |last7=Hirsch |first7=P.R. |last8=Goulding |first8=K.W.T. |date=2011-01-01 |title=Soil management in relation to sustainable agriculture and ecosystem services |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919210001399 |journal=Food Policy |volume=36 |pages=S72–S87 |doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.11.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil management techniques include [[no-till farming]], [[keyline design]], [[windbreaks]] to reduce wind erosion, [[Compost|incorporating carbon-containing organic matter]] back into fields, reducing [[Soil salinity |chemical fertilizers]], and protecting soil from water run-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of sustainable soil management in agroecosystems |date=2013 |publisher=CRC Press |others=Lal, R., Stewart, B.

=== Phosphate ===

Phosphate is a primary component in chemical fertilizer. It is the second most important nutrient for plant after nitrogen,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Atekan |first=A. |last2=Nuraini |first2=Y. |last3=Handayanto |first3=E. |last4=Syekhfani |first4=S. |date=2014-07-07 |title=The potential of phosphate solubilizing bacteria isolated from sugarcane wastes for solubilizing phosphate |url=http://jdmlm.ub.ac.id/index.php/jdmlm/article/view/73 |journal=Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=175–182 |doi=10.15243/jdmlm.2014.014.175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often a limiting factor.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Khan |first=Mohammad Saghir |last2=Zaidi |first2=Almas |last3=Wani |first3=Parvaze A. |date=2007-03-01 |title=Role of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms in sustainable agriculture — A review |journal=Agronomy for Sustainable Development |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=29–43 |doi=10.1051/agro:2006011 |issn=1774-0746}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cordell |first=Dana |last2=White |first2=Stuart |date=2013-01-31 |title=Sustainable Phosphorus Measures: Strategies and Technologies for Achieving Phosphorus Security |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/3/1/86 |journal=Agronomy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=86–116 |doi=10.3390/agronomy3010086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis, energy transfer, signal transduction, macromolecular biosynthesis, and respiration. It is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation, and can increase disease resistance.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sharma |first=Seema B. |last2=Sayyed |first2=Riyaz Z. |last3=Trivedi |first3=Mrugesh H. |last4=Gobi |first4=Thivakaran A. |date=2013-10-31 |title=Phosphate solubilizing microbes: sustainable approach for managing phosphorus deficiency in agricultural soils |journal=SpringerPlus |volume=2 |pages=587 |doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-587|pmid=25674415 |pmc=4320215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and makes up approximately 0.05% of soil biomass.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, only 0.1% of that phosphorus present can be absorbed by plants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is due to poor solubility&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and phosphorus' high reactivity with elements in the soil such as aluminum, calcium, and iron, causing the phosphorus to be fixed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Long-term use of phosphate-containing chemical fertilizers cause [[eutrophication]] and deplete soil fertility, so people have looked to other sources.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

An alternative is rock phosphate, a natural source already in some soils.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=KAUR |first=Gurdeep |last2=REDDY |first2=Mondem Sudhakara |title=Effects of Phosphate-Solubilizing Bacteria, Rock Phosphate and Chemical Fertilizers on Maize-Wheat Cropping Cycle and Economics |journal=Pedosphere |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=428–437 |doi=10.1016/s1002-0160(15)30010-2|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, there are almost 260 million tons of rock phosphate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, rock phosphate is a non-renewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; reserves are expected to be exhausted in 50–100 years; [[peak phosphorus]] will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought|date=2009 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |issue=2|journal=Global Environmental Change |pages=292–305 |year=2009 | last1=Cordell |first1=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected to increase food prices as phosphate fertilizer costs increase.

A way to make rock phosphate more effective and last longer is to implement microbial inoculants such as phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, known as PSMs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A source of these PSMs is compost or the recycling of human and animal waste.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specific PSMs can be added to soil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When these PSMs are present, there has been an increase in crop growth, particularly in terms of shoot height, dry biomass, and grain yield.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Phosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of mycorrhizae in the soil.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant relationships|date=1997|publisher=Springer|others=Carroll, George C., 1940-, Tudzynski, P. (Paul)|isbn=9783662103722|location=Berlin|oclc=679922657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycorrhiza is a type of mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and fungi,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; which are well-equipped to absorb nutrients, including phosphorus, in soil.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shenoy|first=V.V.|last2=Kalagudi|first2=G.M.|title=Enhancing plant phosphorus use efficiency for sustainable cropping|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0734975005000984|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=23|issue=7–8|pages=501–513|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2005.01.004|pmid=16140488|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum, calcium, and iron.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Land ===
{{see also |Peak farmland}}

As the global population increases and demand for food increases, there is pressure on [[land resource]]s. In land use planning and management, considering the impacts of land use changes on factors such as soil erosion can support long-term agricultural sustainability, as shown by a study of Wadi Ziqlab, a dry area in the Middle East where farmers graze livestock and grow olives, vegetables, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mohawesh |first=Yasser |last2=Taimeh |first2=Awni |last3=Ziadat |first3=Feras |date=September 2015 |title=Effects of land use changes and soil conservation intervention on soil properties as indicators for land degradation under a Mediterranean climate. |url=https://www.solid-earth.net/6/857/2015/se-6-857-2015.pdf |journal=Solid Earth |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=857–868 |via= |doi=10.5194/se-6-857-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back over the 20th century shows that for people in poverty, following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grimble |first=Robin |date=April 2002 |title=Rural Poverty and Environmental Management : A framework for understanding |journal=Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=120–132 |doi=10.1177/026537880201900206|oclc=5724786521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, increased [[land degradation]] in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barbier |first=Edward B. |last2=Hochard |first2=Jacob P. |date=May 11, 2016 |title=Does Land Degradation Increase Poverty in Developing Countries? |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152973|pmid=27167738 |pmc=4864404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Land is a finite resource on Earth. And although expansion of agricultural land can decrease [[biodiversity]] and contribute to [[deforestation]], the picture is complex; for instance, a study examining the introduction of sheep by Norse settlers (Vikings) to the Faroe Islands of the North Atlantic concluded that, over time, the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Amanda |last2=Simpson |first2=Ian |last3=Brown |first3=Jennifer |date=October 2005 |title=Sustainable rangeland grazing in Norse Faroe. |url=http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/132/1/simpson-hecol-2005.pdf |journal=Human Ecology |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=737–761 |via= |doi=10.1007/s10745-005-7596-x|hdl=1893/132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and [[urban development]], along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss |loss of biodiversity]] and increased soil erosion.&lt;ref name="fao2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many tools will be called upon to offset these projections. In Europe, one such tool is a geo-spatial data system called SoilConsWeb&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.landconsultingweb.eu/EN_index.html |title=SoilConsWeb |last= |first= |date= |website= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being developed to inform soil conservation minded decision making within agricultural sectors and other areas of land management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Terribile |first=Fabio |date=2015 |title=A Web-based spatial decision supporting system for land management and soil conservation |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276375502 |journal=Solid Earth |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=903–928 |via= |doi=10.5194/se-6-903-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Energy is used all the way down the food chain from farm to fork. In industrial agriculture, energy is used in on-farm mechanisation, food processing, storage, and transportation processes.&lt;ref name=fao2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X8054E/x8054e05.htm#P363_53908 |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf |title=FAO 2011 Energy Smart Food |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals. The [[International Energy Agency]] projects higher prices of non-renewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted. It may therefore decrease global [[food security]] unless action is taken to 'decouple' fossil fuel energy from food production, with a move towards 'energy-smart' agricultural systems including [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="fao" /&gt;
The use of solar powered irrigation in [[Pakistan]] has come to be recognized as a leading example of energy use in creating a closed system for water irrigation in agricultural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advances in Sustainable Agriculture: Solar-powered Irrigation Systems in Pakistan |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/advances-sustainable-agriculture-solar-powered-irrigation-systems-pakistan-232929 | publisher=McGill University | date= 2014-02-12 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

Socioeconomic aspects of sustainability are also partly understood. Regarding less concentrated farming, the best known analysis is Netting's study on smallholder systems through history.&lt;ref&gt;Netting, Robert McC. (1993) Smallholders, Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture. Stanford Univ. Press, Palo Alto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the finite supply of [[natural resources]] at any specific cost and location, agriculture that is inefficient or damaging to needed resources may eventually exhaust the available resources or the ability to afford and acquire them. It may also generate negative [[externality]], such as pollution as well as financial and production costs. There are several studies incorporating these negative externalities in an economic analysis concerning ecosystem services, biodiversity, land degradation and [[sustainable land management]]. These include [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] study led by Pavan Sukhdev and the [[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative]] which seeks to establish an economic cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture.

The way that crops are [[selling |sold]] must be accounted for in the sustainability equation. [[Food]] sold locally does not require additional energy for transportation (including consumers). Food sold at a remote location, whether at a [[farmers' market]] or the [[supermarket]], incurs a different set of energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics) |labour]], and [[transport]].

Pursuing sustainable agriculture results in many localized benefits. Having the opportunities to sell products directly to consumers, rather than at wholesale or commodity prices, allows farmers to bring in optimal profit.

[[Triple bottom line]] frameworks (including social and environmental aspects alongside the financial) show that a sustainable company can be technologically and economically feasible. For this to happen, growth in material consumption and population need to be slowed down and there has to be a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use. To make that transition, long- and short-term goals will need to be balanced enhancing [[Equality of outcome|equity]] and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19921801530|title=Beyond the limits: global collapse or a sustainable future.|last=|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Methods==
[[File:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|[[Polyculture]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]

What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice. Two of the many possible practices of sustainable agriculture are [[crop rotation]] and [[soil amendments |soil amendment]], both designed to ensure that crops being cultivated can obtain the necessary [[nutrient]]s for healthy growth. Soil amendments would include using locally available compost from community recycling centers. These community recycling centers help produce the compost needed by the local organic farms.

Using community recycling from yard and kitchen waste utilizes a local area's commonly available resources. These resources in the past were thrown away into large waste disposal sites, are now used to produce low cost organic compost for organic farming. Other practices includes growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field, each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landinstitute.org/pages/Glover-et-al-2007-Sci-Am.pdf |title=Glover et al. 2007. ''Scientific American'' |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil. [[Nitrogen fixation]] from legumes, for example, used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth, helps to allow the land to be reused annually. Legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate, and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest.

[[Monoculture]], a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, is a very widespread practice, but there are questions about its sustainability, especially if the same crop is grown every year. Today it is realized to get around this problem local cities and farms can work together to produce the needed compost for the farmers around them. This combined with growing a mixture of crops ([[polyculture]]) sometimes reduces disease or pest problems&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6797/abs/406718a0.html Nature 406, 718–722 Genetic diversity and disease control in rice], Environ. Entomol. 12:625)&lt;/ref&gt; but polyculture has rarely, if ever, been compared to the more widespread practice of growing different crops in successive years ([[crop rotation]]) with the same overall [[crop diversity]]. Such methods may also support sustainable weed management in that the development of herbicide-resistant weeds is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mortensen |first=David |date=January 2012 |title=Navigating a Critical Juncture for Sustainable Weed Management |url=http://www.miscugli.it/public/componenti/957/files/Sustainable%20Weed%20Management%20(SC%202857).pdf |journal=BioScience |volume=62 |pages=75–84 |doi=10.1525/bio.2012.62.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cropping systems that include a variety of crops (polyculture and/or rotation) may also replenish nitrogen (if [[legumes]] are included) and may also use resources such as sunlight, water, or nutrients more efficiently (Field Crops Res. 34:239).

Replacing a natural ecosystem with a few specifically chosen plant varieties reduces the genetic diversity found in wildlife and makes the organisms susceptible to widespread [[disease]]. The [[Great Irish Famine |Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of [[monoculture]].
In practice, there is no single approach to sustainable agriculture, as the precise goals and methods must be adapted to each individual case. There may be some techniques of farming that are inherently in conflict with the concept of sustainability, but there is widespread misunderstanding on effects of some practices. Today the growth of local farmers' markets offer small farms the ability to sell the products that they have grown back to the cities that they got the recycled compost from. This will help move people away from the [[slash-and-burn]] or [[slash-and-char]] techniques that are the characteristic feature of [[shifting cultivation]]. These are often cited as inherently destructive, yet slash-and-burn cultivation has been practiced in the Amazon for at least 6000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sponsel | first1 = Leslie E | year = 1986 | title = Amazon ecology and adaptation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 67–97 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.15.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious deforestation did not begin until the 1970s, largely as the result of Brazilian government programs and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Susanna and Alexander Cockburn (1989) The Fate of the Forest: developers, destroyers and defenders of the Amazon. New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry. Some of the key tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called [[Field (agriculture) |paddocks]], lowering stock density, and moving the stock between paddocks frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/sustpast.html |title=Pastures: Sustainable Management |publisher=Attra.ncat.org |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable intensification===
{{Main article |Intensive farming#Sustainable intensive farming}}

In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of synthetic, non renewable inputs whilst maintaining or even boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in the globally important irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. et al |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil treatment===
[[File:daempfen.jpg|thumb|[[Soil steam sterilization#Sheet steaming|Sheet steaming]] with a MSD/moeschle steam boiler (left side)]]

[[Soil steam sterilization |Soil steaming]] can be used as an ecological alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization. Different methods are available to induce steam into the soil in order to kill pests and increase soil health.

Solarizing is based on the same principle, used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/garden/soil-solarization |title=Soil Solarization |work=Rodale's Organic Life |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain crops act as natural biofumigants, releasing pest suppressing compounds. Mustard, radishes, and other plants in the brassica family are best known for this effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/publications/Bulletins/Biomass%20Prod%20of%20Cover%20Crops_Mustard%20Radish%20Fact%20Sht_AG-782_Online_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There exist varieties of mustard shown to be almost as effective as synthetic fumigants at a similar or lesser cost.

== Off-farm impacts ==
A farm that is able to "produce perpetually", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is over-application of synthetic [[fertilizer]] or animal [[manure]]s, which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction, as in the case of [[slash and burn]] farming for livestock feed. In Asia, specific land for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereals productions lands for some cash crops and even recycling of related food crops. In some cases even a small unit of aquaculture is also included in this number (AARI-1996). 

Sustainability affects overall production, which must increase to meet the increasing food and fiber requirements as the world's human population expands to a projected 9.3 billion people by [[2050]]. Increased production may come from creating new farmland, which may [[wikt:amelioration |ameliorate]] carbon dioxide emissions if done through reclamation of desert as in [[Israel]] and [[Palestine (region) |Palestine]], or may worsen emissions if done through [[slash and burn]] farming, as in [[Brazil]].

== Anthropogenic changes ==
{{further|Climate change and agriculture}}
As the Earth is entering the [[Anthropocene]], an epoch characterized by human impacts such as [[climate change]], agriculture and agricultural development are at risk. Agriculture has an enormous environmental footprint, and is simultaneously leading to huge amounts of environmental changes globally and being hugely impacted by these global changes.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rockström|first=Johan|last2=Williams|first2=John|last3=Daily|first3=Gretchen|last4=Noble|first4=Andrew|last5=Matthews|first5=Nathanial|last6=Gordon|first6=Line|last7=Wetterstrand|first7=Hanna|last8=DeClerck|first8=Fabrice|last9=Shah|first9=Mihir|date=2016-05-13|title=Sustainable intensification of agriculture for human prosperity and global sustainability|journal=Ambio|volume=46|issue=1|pages=4–17|doi=10.1007/s13280-016-0793-6|pmid=27405653|pmc=5226894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the human population is continuing to grow rapidly at a rate which will require an increase in food production globally. This is complicated by the fact that the Earth is undergoing rising amounts of environmental risks. Sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population while successfully operating within the changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

== Social ==

=== Development ===
In 2007, the [[United Nations]] reported on "[[Organic farming |Organic Agriculture]] and [[Food security |Food Security]]",&lt;ref name="Dundon2009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2055/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3234100270&amp;docType=Topic+overview&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3234100270&amp;searchId=R2&amp;userGroupName=puya65247&amp;inPS=true |title=Sustainable Agriculture |last=Stanislaus |first=Dundon |date=2009 |website=Gale Virtual Reference Library |access-date=}}{{dead link |date=October 2017 |bot=medic}}{{cbignore |bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that using organic and sustainable agriculture could be used as a tool to reach global food security without expanding land usage and reducing [[environmental impacts]]. Another way to define sustainable agriculture is to give attention to the "human and environmental aspects,"&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; because of the turn to a more unsustainable way of farming in U.S. agriculture. During the [[Great Depression in the United States |Great Depression]] in the United States many farming families were living in subhuman and hungry conditions and treated "sustainability as a resource-input and food-output equation." Though conditions have improved, the farming has not as much done so. There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early 2000s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done.&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; Although global [[food security]] would most likely not drastically fall, these practices would impact, first hand, local, rural farming communities, making them unable to feed themselves and their families. The [[Social science |social scientist]] Charles Kellogg has stated that, "In a final effort, exploited people pass their suffering to the land."&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; This turn to more unsustainable farming has seen suffering for many people. For if something is sustainable, it should be that way in all aspects of it, not just the crop yield or soil health. It has been seen in the [[developing country]] of [[Bangladesh]], the starving of [[Rural area |rural]] farming communities due to their unsustainable farming methods. Sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously "feed its constituent populations."&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt;

There are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers’ profits, better communities, and continue sustainable practices. For example, in [[Uganda]] [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically Modified Organisms]] (GMOs) were originally illegal, however, under stressful circumstances where Banana Bacterial Wilt (BBW) has the potential to wipe out 90% of yield they decided to explore GMOs as a possible solution &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170203003800?via%3Dihub|title=Banana streak virus is very diverse in Uganda|journal=Virus Research|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2003.12.024|pmid=15036835|year=2004|last1=Harper|first1=Glyn|last2=Hart|first2=Darren|last3=Moult|first3=Sarah|last4=Hull|first4=Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, as a result of the banana crisis in Uganda caused by the BBW, the government issued the National Biotechnology and Biosafety bill which will allow scientists that are part of the National Banana Research Program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Genetically engineered bananas resistant to Xanthomonas wilt disease and nematodes|journal=Food and Energy Security|volume=6|issue=2|pages=37–47|doi=10.1002/fes3.101|pmid=28713567|pmc=5488630|year = 2017|last1 = Tripathi|first1 = Leena|last2=Atkinson|first2=Howard|last3=Roderick|first3=Hugh|last4=Kubiriba|first4=Jerome|last5=Tripathi|first5=Jaindra N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion live off the food they grow themselves and it will keep their economy in check because their main sources of produce will remain stable. 

=== Women ===
[[File:Woman at US farmer's market.jpg |thumb |Woman at an American farmers market]]

In the past 30 years (1978-2007) in the [[United States]] the number of women farm operators has tripled.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=66dc7c9e-72cf-458f-9af3-3837ba2bedcd%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4109&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=101450507&amp;db=a9h |title=Beyond 'Inherit It or Marry It': Exploring How Women Engaged in Sustainable Agriculture Access Farmland. |last=Pilgeram |first=Ryanne |date=2015 |website=Academic Search Complete |access-date=13 March 2017}}{{dead link |date=October 2017 |bot=medic}}{{cbignore |bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, women operate 14 percent of farms, compared to five percent in 1978. Much of the growth is due to women farming outside the "male dominated field of conventional agriculture".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In community supported agriculture women represent 40 percent of [[farm]] operators, and 21 percent of [[Organic farming |organic farmers]]. With the change of laws in [[land ownership]] over the past century, [[Woman |women]] are now allowed all the same freedom of land ownership that [[Man |men]] have.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==International policy==
Sustainable agriculture has become a topic of interest in the international policy arena, especially with regards to its potential to reduce the risks associated with a changing climate and growing human population.

The [https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/10701 Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change], as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change, urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy. The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields, necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience. It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade, including in national research and development budgets, land rehabilitation, economic incentives, and infrastructure improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccafs.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/climate_food_commission-spm-nov2011.pdf |title=Achieving food security in the face of climate change: Summary for policy makers from the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change |publisher=CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy ethics ===

Most agricultural professionals agree that there is a "moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability."&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal. Because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. The best way to create policy for [[agriculture]] is to be free of any bias. A good review would be done with "practical wisdom,"&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; a virtue identified by [[Aristotle]], distinguishing practical wisdom from scientific knowledge, this coming from [[Nicomachean Ethics |Nichomachean Ethics]]. The science of agriculture is called "[[agronomy]]", the root of this word relating to scientific law.&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; Although agriculture may not fit well under scientific law, and may not be designed to be treated as an [[Aristotelianism |Aristotelian]] scientific knowledge, but more practical wisdom. Practical wisdom requires recognition of past failures in agriculture to better attain a more sustainable [[Agricultural systems |agricultural system]].

==Urban planning==

The use of available city space (e.g., [[rooftop gardens]], [[community gardens]], [[garden sharing]], and other forms of [[urban agriculture]]) for cooperative food production may be able to contribute to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes : Designing Urban Agriculture for Sustainable Cities |last= |first= |date=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |editor1=Viljoen, Andre|editor2=Howe, Joe |isbn=9781136414329 |oclc=742299840}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A recent idea (2014) is to create large, urban, technical facilities for [[Vertical farming]]. Potential advantages include year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling, and reduced transportation costs.&lt;ref name=Marks2014&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing threats of [[climate change]] have influenced cities and public offiials are thinking more proactively about the ways they can deliver services and food more efficiently. The environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people take back their connection to fresh food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://urbanland.uli.org/news/urban-agriculture-practices-to-improve-cities/|title=Urban Agriculture: Practices to Improve Cities|last=|first=|date=2011-01-18|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises questions; however, about the excess environmental costs associated with local farming vs more large scale operations which offer food security around the world.

== Key debates ==
There are several key debates involving sustainable agriculture:

=== Ecocentric vs technocentric ===
The main debate on how sustainable agriculture might be achieved centers around two different approaches: an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Guy M.|date=2009-09-01|title=Towards Sustainable Agriculture: Current Debates|journal=Geography Compass|language=en|volume=3|issue=5|pages=1757–1773|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2009.00268.x|issn=1749-8198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecocentric approach emphasizes no- or low-growth levels of human development, and focuses on [[Organic farming|organic]] and [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic farming]] techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns, and resource allocation and usage. The technocentric approach argues that [[sustainability]] can be attained through a variety of strategies, from the view that state-led modification of the industrial system like conservation-oriented farming systems should be implemented, to the argument that [[biotechnology]] is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Multifunctional agriculture vs ecosystem services ===
There are different scientific communities that are looking at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two separate lenses: multifunctional agriculture (MFA) and [[ecosystem services]] (ES)&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jiao|last2=Tichit|first2=Muriel|last3=Poulot|first3=Monique|last4=Darly|first4=Ségolène|last5=Li|first5=Shuangcheng|last6=Petit|first6=Caroline|last7=Aubry|first7=Christine|date=2014-10-16|title=Comparative review of multifunctionality and ecosystem services in sustainable agriculture|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=149|pages=138–147|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.10.020|pmid=25463579}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While both of these frameworks are similar, they look at the function of agriculture in different lights. Those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farm-centered approaches, and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The central argument of MFA is that agriculture has other functions aside from the production of food and fiber, and therefore agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise. These additional functions include renewable natural resource management and conservation of landscape and biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Renting|first=H.|last2=Rossing|first2=W.A.H.|last3=Groot|first3=J.C.J|last4=Van der Ploeg|first4=J.D.|last5=Laurent|first5=C.|last6=Perraud|first6=D.|last7=Stobbelaar|first7=D.J.|last8=Van Ittersum|first8=M.K.|date=2009-05-01|title=Exploring multifunctional agriculture.

==Barriers==

Since World War II, dominant models of agriculture in the United States and the entire national food system have been characterized by a focus on monetary [[Profit (economics) |profitability]] at the expense of social and environmental integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schattman |first1=Rachel |title=Sustainable Food Sourcing and Distribution in the Vermont-Regional Food System |url=https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2017 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005131/https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sustainable agriculture, changes in lower rates of soil and [[nutrient]] loss, improved [[soil structure]], and higher levels of beneficial [[microorganism]]s are not quick.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2186/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=958e803d-f9e5-4035-82f5-f53d11a21c82%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=21972513&amp;db=a9h |title=Do You See What I See?

In [[conventional agriculture]] the benefits are easily visible with no weeds, pests, etc. and the "process of externalization" hides the costs to soil and [[ecosystem]]s around it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A major barrier to sustainable agriculture is the lack of knowledge of its benefits. Many benefits are not visible, so they are often unknown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. Some foresee a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]], fewer [[consumer packaged goods]], [[local purchasing]]  with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], more home and [[community garden]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kunstler | first=James Howard | title=Too Much Magic; Wishful Thinking, Technology, and the Fate of the Nation

'''''The Tao of Pooh''''' is a book written by [[Benjamin Hoff]]. The book is intended as an introduction to the Eastern belief system of [[Taoism]] for Westerners. It [[allegory|allegorically]] employs the [[fictional character]]s of [[A. A. Milne]]'s ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' stories to explain the basic principles of philosophical Taoism. Hoff later wrote ''[[The Te of Piglet]]'', a companion book.

==Background==
Hoff wrote the book at night and on weekends while working as a tree pruner in the [[Portland Japanese Garden]] in [[Washington Park, Portland|Washington Park]].&lt;ref name="nytpeace"/&gt;
[[Image:vinegar tasters.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional representation of "[[The vinegar tasters]]"]]

==Synopsis==
The book starts with a description of the [[vinegar tasters]], which is a painting portraying the three great eastern thinkers, [[Confucius]], the [[Buddha]], and [[Laozi]] over a vat of vinegar. Each tasting the vinegar of "life," Confucius finds it sour, the Buddha finds it bitter, but Laozi, the traditional founder of Taoism, finds it satisfying. Then the story unfolds backing up this analogy.

Hoff presents Winnie-the-Pooh and related others from [[A. A. Milne]]'s stories as characters that interact with him while he writes ''The Tao of Pooh'', but also quotes excerpts of their tales from Milne's actual books ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' and ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]],'' in order to exemplify his points. Hoff uses many of Milne's characters to symbolize ideas that differ from or accentuate Taoist tenets. [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] himself, for example, personifies the principles of ''[[Wu wei|wei wu wei]]'', the Taoist concept of "effortless doing," and ''[[p'u|pu]],'' the concept of being open to, but unburdened by, experience, and it is also a metaphor for natural human nature. In contrast, characters like Owl and Rabbit over-complicate problems, often [[Analysis paralysis|over-thinking to the point of confusion]], and [[Eeyore]] pessimistically complains and frets about existence, unable to just ''be''. Hoff regards Pooh's simpleminded nature, unsophisticated worldview and instinctive problem-solving methods as conveniently representative of the Taoist philosophical foundation. The book also incorporates translated excerpts from various prominent Taoist texts, from authors such as [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]].

==Reception==
The book was on the [[New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]] for 49 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Official Website of Benjamin Hoff, author| url=http://www.benjaminhoffauthor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- can't find in archive of list: google query https://www.google.com/search?q=site:hawes.com+Benjamin+Hoff gives only "THE TE OF PIGLET"; --&gt;

The '''UK Native Seed Hub''' (UKNSH) is a project of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]'s [[Millennium Seed Bank Partnership]] growing and distributing seeds of UK native plant species. It is in part a response to the 2010 report Making Space for Nature by [[John Lawton (biologist)|Sir John Lawton]]. The project, located at [[Wakehurst Place]], in [[West Sussex]], in the [[Weald|High Weald]] of southern [[England]] ({{gbmapping|TQ340315}}), is dedicated to enhancing the resilience and coherence of the UK's [[ecological network]]s by improving the quality, quantity, and diversity of UK seed species available for use in conservation, rehabilitation, and restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/business-centre/welcome-uk-native-seed Kew website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2011/09/restoring-native-plants-uk-5-questions-kew-michael-way/  "Restoring Native Plants in the UK: 5 Questions for Kew Scientist Michael Way"], Encyclopædia Britannica Blog, 23 September 2011, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-14545718 "Kew launches native flowers project at Wakehurst Place"], BBC News, Sussex, including 3:00 film clip, 17 August 2011, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The UKNSH makes available to conservation and restoration projects high quality Millennium Seed Bank seed collections, some of which are of species that are not available on the commercial seed market, and some are local provenance collections of species already available. As part of the Royal Botanic Gardens, the UKNSH is a [[nonprofit organization]] &lt;ref name="UKNSH licence agreement"&gt;[http://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/Uk%20native%20seed%20agreement.pdf UKNSH License Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides seeds under a license agreement, ensuring use of the seed only for projects that directly support UK biodiversity and at a charge that only recoups the financial cost of recollection to replace seeds in the bank.&lt;ref name="UKNSH licence agreement" /&gt;

The provision of seed may be accompanied by technical training, advice and research that enable users of the seed and other commercial seed suppliers to improve the knowledge, use, and storage of native seed in the UK.&lt;ref name="UKNSH consultancy"&gt;[http://www.kew.org/business-centre/welcome-uk-native-seed/consultancy Kew consultancy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2011 the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]] gave £750,000 to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew to establish the UKNSH as part of the foundation's 50th Birthday celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esmeefairbairn.org.uk/what-we-fund/major-grants/archived-major-grants/50th-birthday-gifts Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The funding was expected to establish the project over a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/8704251/Kew-sets-up-UK-seed-hub-to-restore-wild-flower-meadows.html "Kew sets up 'UK seed hub' to restore wild flower meadows"], Louise Gray, ''The Telegraph'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Production began at the Wakehurst place nursery in 2011.  In 2012 seed production moved to the new production beds that are on display to the public at Wakehurst Place.  Production focused on regenerating grassland species such as ''[[Campanula rotundifolia]]'' (harebell) and ''[[Genista tinctoria]]'' (dyer’s greenweed) from seed in the Millennium Seed Bank's collections. In May 2014 suitable seed from the Millennium Seed Bank’s collections were made available by the UKNSH seed online list, making it possible for legitimate conservation projects to request seed from the available UKNSH collections.

==The Seed Hub==
The Seed Hub itself is the Wakehurst Place based production site, with a capacity of 28 beds on about a [[hectare]] of land in total, close to the Millennium Seed Bank building and the Visitor Centre (and shown on the visitor's map).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/PPCONT_008368_Primary_0.pdf Wakehurst Visitors' Map] PDF, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The site began construction in 2011 and is maintained by Kew’s horticultural staff.  Seed production is focused on species that are difficult to obtain on the commercial market, due to harvesting, germination, or processing difficulties. Species are often regenerated to create a large collection of seeds of a particular UK provenance, such as the [[South Downs]]’ ''[[Primula veris]]'' (cowslip), or from a particular environmental habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/aug/17/kew-native-seed-hub "Kew unveils native flower seed bank"], Camila Ruz, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17 August 2011, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The site is also open to the public as part of a visit to Wakehurst, and provides a useful environment to observe and photograph plant [[pollinator]]s.

==The Seed List==
To support UK conservation and restoration projects the UKNSH makes the Millennium Seed Bank's high quality, UK origin seeds available to legitimate initiatives aiming to improve the UKs ecological network.&lt;ref name="UKNSH licence agreement" /&gt;  A few of these collections are supplied from the production beds at Wakehurst Place with some being made available from the suitable collections seed bank at the MSBP. Seed is only provided from appropriate collections in the MSBP when the collection is sufficiently large. Where there is not sufficient seed numbers to make a collection available for distribution the species may be bulked up on the production beds. All seed provided is “F1” generation in that is it the offspring of plants harvested from seeds collected directly from the wild. The seed list operates in such a way that the provision of seed to conservation projects will never completely deplete the collection in the bank.

==Support==
The UKNSH also provides a range of training for seeds producers, collectors, and users. This support ensures that seed users understand the importance of high quality seed of a UK origin for UK conservation work, as well as providing them with the skills needed to use the seed.  The support also ensures that appropriate species and provenance seeds are used for the projects location and habitat. Support covers the entire range of seed handling from harvesting, through processing, testing, and storage, to distribution, and sowing. The aim of this support is to improve best practice in UK native seed use. The UKNSH provides advice and services through consultancy to enable the continuation of the project beyond the four year funding of the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation.&lt;ref  name="UKNSH consultancy" /&gt;

The '''unity of science''' is a thesis in [[philosophy of science]] that says that all the sciences form a unified whole.

==Overview==
Even though, for example, [[physics]] and [[sociology]] are distinct disciplines, the thesis of the unity of science says that in principle they must be part of a unified intellectual endeavor: science. The unity of science thesis is usually associated with the view of levels of organization in nature, where physics is the most basic, [[chemistry]] the level above physics, [[biology]] above chemistry, sociology above biology, and so forth. Further, [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[organism]]s, and [[culture]]s are all biological, but they represent three different levels of biological organization.

It has also been suggested (for example, in [[Jean Piaget]]'s 1918 work ''Recherche'') that the unity of science can be considered in terms of a circle of the sciences, where logic is the foundation for mathematics, which is the foundation for mechanics and physics, and physics is the foundation for chemistry, which is the foundation for biology, which is the foundation for sociology, the moral sciences, psychology, and the theory of knowledge, and the theory of knowledge is based on logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch|title=Recherche|last=Piaget|first=Jean|authorlink=Jean Piaget|date=2006|origyear=1918|access-date=9 February 2017|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP_18_Recherche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis of a unity of science simply says that common scientific laws apply everywhere and on all levels of organization.  On some levels of organization, the scientists there will call these laws by another name, or emphasize the importance of one over another.  For example, thermodynamics or the laws of energy seem to be universal across a number of disciplines.  That is almost certainly because nearly all systems in nature operate using transactions in energy.  However, this does not rule out the possibility of some laws being particular to specific domains of inquiry—perhaps characterized by increasing complexity of those domains, as suggested by Henriques' (2003) [[tree of knowledge system]] that proposes four degrees of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture). Of course, his tree might equally be a circle, with culture necessarily framing people's understanding of matter.

Science is a human endeavor, a part of human culture.  It is unified in the sense that it is understood as a single endeavor, and there are no scientists studying alternative realities. To the extent that they do, however, one could argue that they are not unified. It is the perception of a single reality that results in a unity of science.

Separately, science is also apparently on a path toward simplification or actually a "universalization" of discrete scientific theories about energy that physicists call unification. This has led to several theory among which [[string theory]], and is probably related to the notion that, at bottom, there is only the energy that was released in the big bang, and really nothing else. 
 
The unity of science thesis is most famously clarified and tentatively argued for by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]'s [[General System Theory]], Sir Jagdish Chandra Bos ,[[Paul Oppenheim]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. It is most famously argued against by [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Dupre]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]].

The '''University of Panama''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Panamá}}) was founded on October 7, 1935, with a student body of 175 in the fields of Education, Commerce, Natural Sciences, Pharmacy, Pre-Engineering and Law. {{As of|2008}}, it maintains a student body of 74,059 distributed in 228 buildings around the country.

The University of Panama was founded  under the administration of the President of the Republic, Dr. [[Harmodio Arias Madrid]]. Its founder and first President was the distinguished citizen Dr. [[Octavio Méndez Pereira]].
The University of Panama is a state institution of superior, independent education, inspired by the highest civic, moral, and ethical values.

==History==

The University of Panama was created by presidential decree on May 29, 1935. However, it began operations on October 7 of the same year in one of the wings of the Instituto Nacional (National Institute). Later on, under the administration of [[Enrique Adolfo Jiménez|Enrique A. Jiménez]], the government purchased around 60 hectares of land in the neighborhood of El Cangrejo, destined to be the future University's main campus.

The construction work began in January, 1948, under the supervision of the Engineer Alberto De Saint Malo, who was the Dean of the Engineering and Architecture Faculty at the time. The first four buildings to be constructed were those that would be home to Humanities, Engineering and Architecture, Science Laboratories, and Administration and Library. Classes in the new buildings began on May 29, 1950. However, the campus was officially inaugurated on November 1, 1953, the same year of the Republic's 50th Anniversary of Independence. In the 1950s, the construction work continued and 11 additional buildings were raised, some of which would hold the Biochemistry Center, and the Faculties of Pharmacy, and Public Administration and Commerce. In the following decade, 15 more buildings were constructed, among of which figure the Odontology and Law Faculties, and the Experimental Center for Agricultural Research in Tocumen.

Between 1970 and 1980, the buildings that were destined for Biology, Architecture, Engineering, Humanities (other), and those destined for the Simón Bolivar Library and for the Laboratory of Specialized Analysis, among others, were finished. At the end of 1979, the University of Panama received the facilities of the Rainbow City High School in [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], where the first of the University's Regional Centers would begin operations. In the following decade, the Regional Centers for the provinces of [[Veraguas]], [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]] and [[Coclé]], and for the region of [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] were built, including an Agricultural Sciences Faculty in Chiriquí.

In the 1990s, the Regional Center for Panamá Oeste (Western Panama) and four buildings destined for research were constructed. At the end of the decade, in 1999 to be more specific, the ARI (Interoceanic Regional Authority) transferred the buildings of the former Curundu Junior High School to the University of Panama. This complex would later hold the Harmodio Arias Madrid Campus. Other facilities transferred were the ones later used for the Veterinary Hospital, in [[Corozal, Panama|Corozal]]. Also during this time, the University expanded its number of buildings by adding 19 more, thanks to the acquisition of adjacent buildings and to the construction of the Regional Center in [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]], the extensions of [[Chepo, Panamá Province|Chepo]] and [[Darién Province|Darién]], and the Popular Universities of Azuero and Coclé, today known as Universidades del Trabajo y La Tercera Edad (Universities of Labor and Elders).

==Achievements==
Several international research agreements and personnel exchanges have been made by government agencies with the institution. Professors in areas of science and technology, medical health, economics and law have been invited to give keynotes and also teach in other campuses around the world.  The University of Panama has also sent representatives to several international congresses and meetings such as Women and Gender, [[World Economic Forum]], environmental congresses, biological research meetings, statistics congresses and many other disciplines.

'''Urban studies'''  is based on the study of the [[Urban Development|urban development]] of cities. This includes studying the history of city development from an [[Architecture|architectural]] point of view, to the impact of [[urban design]] on [[community development]] efforts. Urban studies helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rural-Communities-Cornelia-Butler-Flora/dp/0813349710/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KE2J30BWZH4HECY3Y5BN|title=Rural Communities: Legacy + Change|last=Flora|first=Cornelia Butler|last2=Flora|first2=Jan L.|last3=Gasteyer|first3=Stephen P.|date=2015-08-04|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813349718|edition=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field originated primarily from the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], and has spread to research how international cities apply this research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701015428|title=The ghetto : contemporary global issues and controversies|last=Ray.|first=Hutchison,|last2=1960-|first2=Haynes, Bruce D.,|date=2012|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813345031|oclc=701015428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Urban Studies is a large and diverse area of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw0538k5r9c |title=Ronan Paddison, Editor-in-Chief of Urban Studies |website=YouTube |access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of this, organizations like the [[Urban Studies Foundation]] (in connection with the [[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies Journal]]), provide grant funding for research explicitly aimed at better understanding the complex reality of cities and urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://urbanstudiesfoundation.org |title=Urban Studies Foundation - Grant funding for innovative research projects that advance the frontiers of urban knowledge |website=Urban Studies Foundation |access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The study of cities has changed dramatically from the 1800s over time, with new frames of analysis being applied to the development of urban areas.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson, J. 2016. pp.3-29"&gt;Robinson, J., 2016. Thinking cities through elsewhere: Comparative tactics for a more global urban studies. Progress in Human Geography, 40(1), pp.3-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The first college programs were created to observe how cities were developed based off anthropological research of ghetto communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2Y5DQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=anthropological+urban+studies+1800's+Europe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Encyclopedia of Anthropology|last=Birx|first=H. James|date=2005-12-08|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761930297|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1900s, urban study programs expanded beyond just looking at the current and historical impacts of city design and began studying how those designs impacted the future interactions of people and how to improve city development through architecture, open spaces, the interactions of people, and different types of capital that forms a community.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Urban history]] plays an important role in this field of study because it reveals how cities have developed previously.&lt;ref name="The History in Urban Studies: A Comment"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Harris|first1= Richard|last2= Smith|first2= Michael E.|date= 2011|title= THE HISTORY IN URBAN STUDIES: A COMMENT|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00547.x/abstract|journal= Journal of Urban Affairs|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 99–105|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00547.x|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; History plays a large role in determining how cities will change in the future. Such areas change continuously as part of larger processes and create new histories that researchers study on both large-scale and individual levels.&lt;ref name="The New Urban History"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hersberg|first1= Theodore|date= 1978|title= The New Urban History: Toward an Interdisciplinary History of the City|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009614427800500101|journal= Journal of Urban History|volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= 3–40|doi= 10.1177/009614427800500101|access-date= May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, three different themes&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Studying Cities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paddison |first=Ronan |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Studying Cities |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=177–193 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} have influenced how researchers have and will continue to study urban areas:
# Spatial structures: Reflect how the city is physically organized
# Processes that support spatial structure: Question how the city's structure operates
# Normative Analysis: Construct opinions supported by facts to promote better urban planning methods

Scholars have also researched how cities outside of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] have developed, but only to a limited degree. Urban history previously focused mostly on how European and American cities developed over time, instead of focusing on how non-European cities developed.&lt;ref name="A decade of Urban History: Ashgate's Historical Urban Studies series"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Doyle|first1= Barry M.|date= 2009|title= A decade of urban history: Ashgate’s Historical Urban Studies series|url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/urban-history/article/a-decade-of-urban-history-ashgates-historical-urban-studies-series/F9AC32550D106168CCDAF52861F9E1BB|journal= Urban History|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 498–512|doi= 10.1017/S0963926809990149|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional geographic areas researched in this field include [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Parnell|first1= Susan|date= 1997|title= South African Cities: Perspectives from the Ivory Tower of Urban Studies|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0042098975871?journalCode=usja|journal= Urban Studies|volume= 34|issue= 5-6|pages= 891–906|doi= 10.1080/0042098975871|access-date= April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Huxley|first1= Margo|last2= Loughlin|first2= J.

Racial history in the United States

The [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] of urban residents in the United States has played an important role in developing this field. One program founded to research African-American urban residents, the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]], was founded in 1959 to study [[Racial segregation in the United States#Residential Segregation|residential segregation]] and to support affected communities.&lt;ref name="Beyond Civil Rights"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geary |first=Daniel |date=2015 |chapter= Chapter 4: The Death of White Sociology |title=The Moynihan Report and its Legacy |location= Philadelphia, PA|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=110–138 | isbn= 9780812247312}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, studies related to race and urban life started to focus on [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]] to study how individuals lived in relation to the city and their respective systems as a whole.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Studying Cities" /&gt;

[[Israel Zangwill]] wrote one of the first books on the Ghetto's of Europe and how they impacted the Jewish children that were descendants of the original residents, ''Children of the Ghetto''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''(1892),'' he also wrote two other books about the European Ghettos. [[Louis Wirth]] was the next scholar to write about the Ghettos, he wrote about them from a sociological perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Louis Wirth and [[Robert Ezra Park|Roberts Ezra Park]] also became the first sociologists to publish about the immigrant neighborhoods in America with suggestions on their future design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roberts Ezra Park was the student of George Zimmel who studied the "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]" in Chicago.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other famous scholars that studied segregation, American Ghettos, and impoverished neighborhoods include [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] (1903),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Haynes (1913),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Johnson (1943),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Horace R.

==Areas of research==

This field is [[transdisciplinary]] because it uses theories from a variety of academic fields and places them within an urban context.&lt;ref name="Transdisciplinarity and its challenges"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ramadier|first1= Thierry|date= 2004|title= Transdisciplinarity and its challenges: the case of urban studies|url= |journal= Journal of Urban Affairs|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 99–105|doi= 10.1016/j.futures.2003.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of academic fields refers to the urban environment as a location studied, such as [[Environmental Studies]], [[Economics]], [[Geography]],&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson, J. 2016. pp.3-29"/&gt; [[Public Health]], and [[Sociology]].&lt;ref name="The History in Urban Studies: A Comment"/&gt; However, scholars in this field research how specific elements contribute to how the city operates, such as how [[housing]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Housing"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1= Ray |last2= Williams|first2= Peter|date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Housing in the Twentieth Century |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=88–101 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[transportation]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Transportation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Tom |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Transport and the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=102–123 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; will change. In addition, researchers also study how residents interact within the city, such as how [[Racism in the United States|race]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Race Relations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Darden |first=Joe T. |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Race Relations in the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=177–193 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociology of gender|gender]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Gender"&gt;{{cite book |last=McDowell |first=Linda M. |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Women, Men, Cities |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=206–219 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; differences lead to [[Social inequality|social inequalities]], or concentrated disadvantage in urban areas.

==Criticism==

In the [[United States]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] has heavily impacted where African-Americans live. [[Black power movement|Black Power movements]], particularly the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], have criticized how the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]] researched the African-American urban population but did not understand the community's needs.&lt;ref name="Beyond Civil Rights"/&gt;

Researchers also struggle with how terms are created and used both inside and outside the field. Researchers even struggle how to define basic terms precisely, such as how a [[city]] is defined, due to how the roles of cities change.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Defining City"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frey |first=William H. |last2=Zimmer| first2=Zachary |date=2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter=Defining the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers must be careful in how they describe urban areas, as their work can be manipulated as positive elements for [[boosterism|city boosters]] wanting to promote a specific city.&lt;ref name="Superlatives in Contemporary Urban Studies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brenner|first1= Neil  |date= 2003|title= Stereotypes, Archetypes, and Prototypes: Three Uses of Superlatives in Contemporary Urban Studies|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6040.00051/abstract|journal= City &amp; Community|volume= 2|issue= 3|pages= 205–216|doi= 10.1111/1540-6040.00051|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4568">{{short description|specialist term for a work that collates all known variants of a text}}
A '''variorum''', short for ''(editio) cum notis variorum'', is a work that collates all known variants of a text.  It is a work of [[textual criticism]], whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.

==Etymology==
The word ''variorum'' is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase ''cum notis variorum'' ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.

==Original meaning==
An older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'.  Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publishers of the 17th century, including the house of [[Elsevier]].  In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period;  the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators.  The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information.  Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, [[Nicolas Heinsius]]'s edition of [[Claudius Claudianus|Claudian]] (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.

==Notable variorum editions==
A variorum of the [[Bible]] has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with {{em|all}} variants in wording, from {{em|all}} known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.

There have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], including the readings of all [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|quartos and folios]]; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of [[Isaac Reed]] in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times.  A variorum&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, Morse, ed. (1959), ''The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Variorum Text'', [[Philadelphia]]: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1959.

There is also a variorum of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. [[Walt Whitman]] produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The [[New York University Press]] produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Sculley, Harold W. Blodgett and William White, eds. (1980), ''Leaves of Grass: A Textual Variorum of the Printed Poems, 1855-1891''; 3 vol., (Series: ''The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman''); New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Strachey]] translation of [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in volumes four and five of ''[[The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud]]'' collates eight editions.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the [http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in Bichitra] website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Vitrified forts''' are stone enclosures whose walls have been subjected to [[vitrification]] through heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brigantesnation.com/VitrifiedForts/VitrifieedForts.htm |title=Vitrification of Hill Forts |accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was long thought that these structures were unique to Scotland, but they have since been identified in several other parts of western and northern Europe.

Vitrified forts are generally situated on hills offering strong defensive positions. Their form seems to have been determined by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose. The walls vary in size, a few being upwards of {{convert|12|ft}} high, and are so broad that they present the appearance of [[levee|embankments]]. Weak parts of the defence are strengthened by double or triple walls, and occasionally vast lines of [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]], composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones, envelop the vitrified centre at some distance from it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vitrified Forts |volume=28 |pages=149–150 |first=Robert |last=Munro |authorlink=Robert Munro (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls themselves are termed vitrified ramparts.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy (2008). ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology'', 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 376. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953404-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[cement]] has been found in any of these structures, all of them presenting the peculiarity of being more or less consolidated by the fusion of the rocks of which they are built. This fusion, which has been caused by the application of intense heat, is not equally complete in the various forts, or even in the walls of the same fort. In some cases the stones are only partially melted and [[calcined]]; in others their adjoining edges are fused so that they are firmly cemented together; in many instances pieces of rock are enveloped in a glassy enamel-like coating which binds them into a uniform whole; and at times, though rarely, the entire length of the wall presents one solid mass of vitreous substance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It is not clear why or how the walls were subjected to vitrification. Some [[antiquarian]]s have argued that it was done to strengthen the wall, but the heating actually weakens the structure. Battle damage is also unlikely to be the cause, as the walls are thought to have been subjected to carefully maintained fires to ensure they were hot enough for vitrification to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/vterms/g/vitrified_forts.htm Vitrification temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benderloch.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1139 More information and the vitrification debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most archaeologists now consider that vitrified forts are the product of deliberate destruction either following the capture of the site by an enemy force or by the occupants at the end of its active life as an act of ritual closure.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"&gt;Ralston 2006, 143-63{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process has no chronological significance and is found during both Iron Age and Early Medieval Forts in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"/&gt;

Since [[John Williams (geologist)|John Williams]], one of the earliest of British [[geologist]]s, and author of ''The Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom'', first described these singular ruins in 1777, over 70 examples have been discovered in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The most remarkable are:
*Dun Mac Sniachan (or [[Dun]] Mac Uisneachan), Argyll, the largest in area{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} at 245 m by 50 m.
*[[Benderloch]], north of [[Oban]]; {{gbmapping|NM 902 381}}

For a long time it was supposed that these forts were peculiar to Scotland; but they are found also in the Isle of Man (Cronk Sumark) [[County Londonderry]] and [[County Cavan]], Ireland; in [[Upper Lusatia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and [[Thuringia]]; in the provinces on the [[Rhine]], especially in the neighbourhood of the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]]; in the [[Uecker|Ucker Lake]]; in Brandenburg, where the walls are formed of burnt and smelted [[brick]]s; in Hungary; in several places in France, such as Châteauvieux (near [[Pionnat]]), Péran, [[La Courbe]], [[Sainte-Suzanne, Mayenne|Sainte-Suzanne]], [[Puy de Gaudy]], and [[Thauron]]; also rarely in the north of England. [[Broborg|Barksdale]] is a vitrified hill-fort in [[Uppland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Appearance in Media==
===''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''===
The 16 September 1980 episode of this series features a segment in which the archaeologist Ian Ralston examines the mystery of the vitrified fort Tap o' Noth and tries to recreate how it might be accomplished by piling stones and setting a massive bonfire, repeating the work of [[V. Gordon Childe]] and [[Wallace Thorneycroft]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, A. C]], Welfare, S and Fairley, J. ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''. Collins, 1980, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment produced a few partially vitrified stones, but no answers were gleaned as to how large-scale forts could have been crafted with the approach tried in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World'' ([[Yorkshire Television]] 1980; episode 3: "Ancient Wisdom" ([[Network DVD]] 7952792). Segment runs from 10:58 to 17:150&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Tilden Blodgett''' (1823 – 4 November 1875) was a [[New York City]] art collector who was instrumental in founding the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He was active in the [[American Civil War]] and organized the NYC [[Union League Club]] and the [[Sanitary Fair]] to raise funds for the wounded. He founded the newspaper ''[[The Nation]]'' and was a leader in establishing the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was a founding member of the committee to form the Met in 1869 and was its first chairman. He had been on the selection committee for the American works to be presented at the French exhibition of 1867 and thus felt he knew enough to purchase pictures for the young museum while abroad in 1870.

He purchased a total of 174 pictures which he financed together with [[John Taylor Johnston]] and about half of this "1871 purchase" is still in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2011/today-in-met-history-march-28 Today in MET History]], museum blog in 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
