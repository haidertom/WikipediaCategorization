'''[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]]''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.

In [[Armenia]] the right of access to information is guaranteed and defined by the Articles 27 and 27.1 of the Constitution. Also, Armenia has a specific law on freedom of information providing the basic foundations for the realization of this right. According to the Constitution and the Law,  in Armenia everybody, in spite of the fact he/she is a citizen of the country or not, has a right to have access to information.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foi.am/en/faq/  |title= 12 Questions and Answers on FOI |date= |website=Foi.am |publisher=Freedom of Information Center of Armenia |access-date=19 January 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

The Law on Freedom of Information was adopted in September 2003 and was widely considered a progressive document, greatly appreciated by international experts.&lt;ref name=EPCSF&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title=Report on the state of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url=http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher=Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum |access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the adoption of the law, civil society and the journalists community, have advocated for the need to pass the regulations that would have supported and improved the implementation of the law. Such regulations were finally adopted in October 2015, when the Armenian government approved a procedure for improving the effectiveness of the procedure to access public information by streamlining the classification, maintenance and provision of information from the government to the public. Prior to the adoption of these regulations, in several cases public officials used to cite the lack of these implementation rules when refusing requests for information.&lt;ref name="USA2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foi.am/en/news/item/1546/ |title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2015 Armenia |last= |first= |date=14 April 2016 |website=Foi.am |publisher=Freedom of Information Center for Armenia |access-date=19 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies concerned by access to information===
According to the law, people can obtain information from: central government bodies, self-governing bodies, state institutions, organizations financed from central or local government finances, organizations with public functions, i.e. organisations providing public services (for instance, private universities, schools, hospitals, energy provider companies, etc.)&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt; Each body has a person that is responsible for freedom of information and is in charge of dealing with information requests.&lt;ref name="FOIFAQ" /&gt;

===Procedure===
To submit a request to access information, applicants have to apply to the information holder with a written or oral inquiry to be addressed to specific departments in the appropriate body or organization. Civil society organizations advocating for access to information suggest to apply with a written inquiry so that a compliant can be done in case of rejection. To be taken into consideration, both written and oral inquiries have to meet the requirements stated by the law.&lt;ref name="FOIFAQ" /&gt;

The inquirer is not obliged to justify the enquiry and to state the reason for it or how the information sought is going to be used.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

If the body/organizations does not possess all the details concerning the information required, the information holder has to provide the available parts and mention the name and the location of other possible information holders who might be in possess of other details concerning the information sought.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

Information are provided free of charge. Only technical expenses of information provision (photocopies, electronic supports, etc.) can be charged.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

===Exceptions===
Freedom of information can be restricted only on grounds well defined by the law. Information holder may refuse to provide information if it contains state, official, bank or trade secret; infringe the privacy of individuals and his family; contains pre-investigation data which cannot be made public; concerns data with accessibility limitation (such as business, notary or medical secrets); infringes copyright and associated rights.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

===Right to appeal===
In case of rejection, the information holder has to inform the applicant within 5 days in a written form and explain the reasons for the refusal as well as the relevant appealing procedures. Denials can be appealed to the [[Ombudsman]] or the court by administrative procedure. Citizens can also apply directly to the concerned bodies without appealing by an administrative procedure. Also, it is possible to apply to non-governmental organizations which provide legal advisory.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

In practice, despite the good legal framework, citizens and media professionals face some problems in accessing documents, such as incomplete disclosure of the information required, extensions of the time frame for obtaining information prescribed by the law, the refusal of some government bodies and officials to implement the law, and so forth.&lt;ref name=EPCSF/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA2016/&gt; According to the NGO [[Freedom of Information Center of Armenia]] and the [[Transparency International]] Anticorruption Center, the main challenge is the behaviour of some public officials and public bodies that continue to provide answers that are either irrelevant or incomplete. This has resulted in major difficulties for NGOs being less and less successful in bringing freedom of information cases before the courts than in previous years, as judges rejected their cases on the grounds that public offices had provided the answers, regardless of their content.&lt;ref name=USA2016/&gt;

In Armenia, NGOs have played a significant role in educating the public on how to exercise their "right to know" and have organised trainings for public officials. By 2012, the NGO Freedom of Information Center Armenia has distributed around 2050 bulletin boards in several urban and rural communities in order to inform the public on the right to access public information and how to realize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/armenia |title=Armenia.

[[File:Hieronymus Wierix - Acedia - WGA25736.jpg|thumb|Acedia, engraving by [[Hieronymus Wierix]], 16th century]]
'''Acedia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|iː|d|i|ə}}; also '''accidie''' or '''accedie''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|ᵻ|d|i}}, from [[Latin]] ''acedĭa'', and this from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκηδία, "negligence", ἀ- "lack of" -κηδία "care") is a state of listlessness or [[torpor]], of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world.  It can lead to a state of being unable to perform one's duties in life.  Its spiritual overtones make it related to but arguably distinct from [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = the hermitary and Meng-hu | title  = Acedia, Bane of Solitaries | url = http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html | year = 2004 |accessdate =22 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090103154838/http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html| archivedate= 3 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acedia was originally noted as a problem among monks and other ascetics who maintained a solitary life.

==Aquinas' definition==

The ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t95.e35 accidie]"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; defines acedia (or accidie) as "a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray". Some see it as the precursor to [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]—one of the [[seven deadly sins]]. In his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with "the sorrow of the world" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that "worketh death" and contrasts it with that sorrow "according to God" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is "sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good." It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's "flight" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, "on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].

Aquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted "spiritual joy", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, "One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa'', I, 48, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient depictions==
[[Image:Brueghel - Sieben Laster - Disidia.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted by [[Pieter Bruegel the elder]].]]
Moral theologians, intellectual historians and cultural critics have variously construed acedia as the ancient depiction of a variety of psychological states, behaviors or existential conditions: primarily [[laziness]], [[apathy]], [[ennui]] or [[boredom]].

The demon of acedia holds an important place in early monastic [[demonology]] and proto-psychology. In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as "the most troublesome of all" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary, the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', "the noonday demon", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun,  as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.&lt;ref&gt;John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"should be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.&lt;ref&gt;''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: "The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Signs==
[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in Sopron, Hungary.]]
Acedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this "temptation"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being "a slave from within". She relates this to forgetfulness about "the one thing needful": remembrance of God.

==In culture==
*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an "indolence of the heart" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: "The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.&lt;ref name="BenjamínOsborne2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjamín|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwy7yFgFN4IC|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee, ''Virginia Wolff'' (1996) p. 708&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chekhov]] and [[Samuel Becket]]'s plays often have themes of acedia.
*[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an essay on acedia called "Accidie". A non-Christian, he examines "the noon day demons" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.
*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in [[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]] cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14097">'''Atomic units''' ('''au''' or '''a.u.''') form a [[systems of measurement|system]] of [[natural units]] which is especially convenient for [[atomic physics]] calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, '''[[Hartree]] atomic units'''&lt;ref name="Hartree28"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hartree|first=D.

This article deals with '''Hartree atomic units''', where the numerical values of the following four fundamental [[physical constants]] are all unity by definition:

* [[Electron mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[Elementary charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;;
* Reduced [[Planck's constant]] &lt;math&gt;\hbar = h/(2 \pi)&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[Coulomb's constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_\text{e} = 1/(4 \pi \epsilon_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

In Hartree units, the [[speed of light]] is approximately &lt;math&gt;137&lt;/math&gt;. Atomic units are often abbreviated "a.u." or "au", not to be confused with the same abbreviation used also for [[astronomical unit]]s, [[arbitrary unit]]s, and [[absorbance|absorbance units]] in different contexts.

== Use and notation ==
Atomic units, like [[SI units]], have a unit of mass, a unit of length, and so on. However, the use and notation is somewhat different from SI.

Suppose a particle with a mass of ''m'' has 3.4 times the mass of electron. The value of ''m'' can be written in three ways:

But if a length ''L'' were 3.4 times the atomic unit of length, the equation would look the same, "&lt;math&gt;L = 3.4~\text{a.u.}&lt;/math&gt;" The dimension needs to be inferred from context.&lt;ref name=Pilar /&gt;

== Fundamental atomic units ==
These four fundamental constants form the basis of the atomic units (see above). Therefore, their numerical values in the atomic units are unity by definition.

== Related physical constants ==
[[Dimensionless physical constant]]s retain their values in any system of units. Of particular importance is the [[fine-structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{e^2}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)\hbar c} \approx 1/137&lt;/math&gt;. This immediately gives the value of the [[speed of light]], expressed in atomic units.

== SI and Gaussian-CGS variants, and magnetism-related units ==
There are two common variants of atomic units, one where they are used in conjunction with [[SI units]] for [[electromagnetism]], and one where they are used with [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-CGS units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A note on Units|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys7550/phys7550_sp07/extras/Appendix_1.pdf|work=Physics 7550 — Atomic and Molecular Spectra|publisher=University of Colorado lecture notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the units written above are the same either way (including the unit for electric field), the units related to magnetism are not. In the SI system, the atomic unit for magnetic field is
: 1 a.u. = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar}{e a_0^2}&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|2.35|e=5}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]] = {{val|2.35|e=9}} [[gauss (unit)|G]],
and in the Gaussian-cgs unit system, the atomic unit for magnetic field is
: 1 a.u. = &lt;math&gt;\frac{e}{a_0^2 c} &lt;/math&gt; = {{val|1.72|e=3}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]] = {{val|1.72|e=7}} [[gauss (unit)|G]].
(These differ by a factor of [[fine structure constant|α]].)

Other magnetism-related quantities are also different in the two systems. An important example is the [[Bohr magneton]]: In SI-based atomic units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chis|first=Vasile|title=Atomic Units; Molecular Hamiltonian; Born-Oppenheimer Approximation|url=http://phys.ubbcluj.ro/~vchis/cursuri/cspm/course2.pdf|work=Molecular Structure and Properties Calculations|publisher=Babes-Bolyai University lecture notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{B} = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_\text{e}} = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; a.u.
and in Gaussian-based atomic units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Budker|first1=Dmitry|last2=Kimball|first2=Derek F.|last3=DeMille|first3=David P.|title=Atomic Physics: An Exploration through Problems and Solutions|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850950-9|page=380|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GW6pclAk-JcC&amp;pg=PA380}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{B} = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_\text{e} c}=\alpha/2\approx 3.6\times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; a.u.

== Bohr model in atomic units ==
Atomic units are chosen to reflect the properties of electrons in atoms. This is particularly clear from the classical [[Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] in its [[ground state]]. The ground state electron orbiting the hydrogen nucleus has (in the classical Bohr model):

* Orbital velocity = 1
* Orbital radius = 1
* [[Angular momentum]] = 1
* Orbital period = 2π
* [[Ionization energy]] = {{frac|1|2}}
* Electric field (due to nucleus) = 1
* Electrical attractive force (due to nucleus) = 1

== Non-relativistic quantum mechanics in atomic units ==
The [[Schrödinger equation]] for an electron in SI units is
: &lt;math&gt;- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}) \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r}, t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The same equation in '''au''' is
: &lt;math&gt;- \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}) \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r}, t)&lt;/math&gt;.

For the special case of the electron around a hydrogen atom, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] in SI units is:
: &lt;math&gt;\hat H = - {{{\hbar^2} \over {2 m_e}}\nabla^2} - {1 \over {4 \pi \epsilon_0}}{{e^2} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;,

while '''atomic units''' transform the preceding equation into
: &lt;math&gt;\hat H = - {{{1} \over {2}}\nabla^2} - {{1} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Comparison with Planck units ==
Both [[Planck units]] and au are derived from certain fundamental properties of the physical world, and are free of [[anthropocentric]] considerations. It should be kept in mind that au were designed for atomic-scale calculations in the present-day universe, while Planck units are more suitable for [[quantum gravity]] and early-universe [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Both au and Planck units normalize the [[reduced Planck constant]]. Beyond this, Planck units normalize to 1 the two fundamental constants of [[general relativity]] and cosmology: the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, ''c''. Atomic units, by contrast, normalize to 1 the mass and charge of the electron, and, as a result, the speed of light in atomic units is a large value, &lt;math&gt;1/\alpha \approx 137&lt;/math&gt;. The orbital velocity of an electron around a small atom is of the order of 1 in atomic units, so the discrepancy between the velocity units in the two systems reflects the fact that electrons orbit small atoms much slower than the speed of light (around 2 orders of magnitude slower).

There are much larger discrepancies in some other units. For example, the unit of mass in atomic units is the mass of an electron, while the unit of mass in Planck units is the [[Planck mass]], a mass so large that if a single particle had that much mass it might collapse into a [[black hole]]. Indeed, the Planck unit of mass is 22 orders of magnitude larger than the au unit of mass. Similarly, there are many orders of magnitude separating the Planck units of energy and length from the corresponding atomic units.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5636">The '''Clausius–Mossotti relation''' expresses the [[dielectric constant]] (relative [[permittivity]], ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) of a material in terms of the atomic polarizibility, α, of the material's constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is named after [[Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]]. It is equivalent to the  [[Lorentz–Lorenz equation]]. It may be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rysselberghe|first=P. V.|title=Remarks concerning the Clausius–Mossotti Law|journal=J. Phys. Chem.|date=January 1932|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1152–1155|doi=10.1021/j150334a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;{{cite book|title=Atkins' Physical Chemistry|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954337-3|pages=622–629|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter|last2=de Paula|first2=Julio|chapter=Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} - 1}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} + 2}   = \frac{N \alpha}{3\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r = \epsilon/\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dielectric constant]] of the material
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]]
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of the molecules (number per cubic meter), and
*&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electric susceptibility#Molecular polarizability|molecular polarizability]] in SI-units (C·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V).

In the case that the material consists of a mixture of two or more species, the right hand side of the above equation would consist of the sum of the molecular polarizability contribution from each species,  indexed by ''i'' in the following form: (see Lorrain and Corson - Electromagnetic Field and Waves, 1962, 2nd Edition, page 116)

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} - 1}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} + 2}   = \sum_i \frac{N_i \alpha_i}{3\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]] the Clausius–Mossotti relation is typically rewritten to show the [[Polarizability#Definition|molecular polarizability ''volume'']] &lt;math&gt;\alpha' = \alpha/(4\pi\varepsilon_0)&lt;/math&gt; which has units of volume (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt; Confusion may arise from the practice of using the shorter name "molecular polarizability" for both &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; within literature intended for the respective unit system.

==Lorentz–Lorenz equation==
The '''Lorentz–Lorenz equation''' is similar to the Clausius–Mossotti relation, except that it relates the [[refractive index]] (rather than the [[dielectric constant]]) of a substance to its [[polarizability]]. The Lorentz–Lorenz equation is named after the Danish mathematician and scientist [[Ludvig Lorenz]], who published it in 1869, and the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], who discovered it independently in 1878.

The most general form of the Lorentz–Lorenz equation is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} = \frac{4 \pi}{3} N \alpha_\mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]], &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules per unit volume, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean [[polarizability]]. 
This equation is approximately valid for homogeneous solids as well as liquids and gases.

When the square of the refractive index is &lt;math&gt; n^2 \approx 1 &lt;/math&gt;, as it is for many gases, the equation reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt; n^2 - 1 \approx 4 \pi N \alpha_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;
or simply
:&lt;math&gt; n - 1 \approx 2 \pi N \alpha_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

This applies to gases at ordinary pressures. The refractive index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the gas can then be expressed in terms of the [[molar refractivity]]  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;  n \approx \sqrt{1 + \frac{3 A p}{R T}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure of the gas, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the (absolute) temperature, which together determine the number density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Consumer privacy''' is a form of [[information privacy]] concerned with the [[legal]] and [[political]] issues arising from the interaction of the public's [[expectation of privacy]] with the collection and dissemination of [[data]] by [[Business|businesses]] or [[Merchant|merchants]]. [[Consumer]] privacy concerns date back to the first commercial [[courier]]s and bankers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy. In modern times, the [[ethical code]]s of most professions specify measures to protect customer privacy, including [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]], and [[national security]]. Since most organizations have a competitive incentive to retain exclusive access to customer data, and since customer trust is usually a priority, many companies adopt [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy.

'''Consumer privacy protection''' is the use of laws and regulations to protect individuals from privacy loss due to the failures and limitations of corporate customer privacy measures.  Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid [[legal liability]] in the chance that lapses of security may occur. Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a [[telephone company]] had access to unprecedented levels of information. Customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate [[data sharing]], [[Mergers and acquisitions|corporate mergers]], [[employee turnover]], and theft of data storage devices (e.g., [[hard drives]]) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location.

Consumer privacy concerns date back{{When|date=June 2017}} to the first commercial [[courier]]s and [[bank]]ers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy.{{Where|date=June 2017}} Harsh punitive measures were passed as the result of failing to keep a customer's information private. In modern times, the [[ethical code]]s of most professions specify privacy measures for the consumer of any service, including [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]], and [[national security]]. These codes are particularly important in a [[carceral state]], where no privacy in any form nor limits on [[State (polity)|state]] oversight or data use exists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Modern concerns ===
'''Corporate customer privacy practices''' are approaches taken by commercial organizations to ensure that confidential customer data is not stolen or abused.  Since most organizations have strong competitive incentives to retain exclusive access to these data, and since customer trust is usually a high priority, most companies take some [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy. There is also a concern that companies may sell consumer data if they have to declare bankruptcy, although it often violates their own privacy policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siam|first=Kayla|date=2017|title=Coming to a Retailer near You: Consumer Privacy Protection in Retail Bankruptcies|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=1014a1d6-916f-4c56-8b6e-a7bc3d603ba2%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=124102448|journal=Emory Bankruptcy Developments Journal|volume=33|pages=487-521|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vary in effectiveness, and would not typically meet the much higher standards of [[client confidentiality]] applied by [[ethical code]]s or [[legal code]]s in [[banking]] or [[law]], nor [[patient privacy]] measures in medicine, nor rigorous [[national security]] measures in military and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence organizations]].

Since they operate for-profit, commercial organizations also cannot spend unlimited funds on precautions while remaining competitive; a commercial context tends to limit privacy measures and to motivate organizations to share data when working in partnership. The damage done by privacy loss is not measurable, nor can it be undone, and commercial organizations have little or no interest in taking unprofitable measures to drastically increase the privacy of customers. Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid legal liability in the chance that lapses of security may occur. This has led to many [[moral hazard]]s and customer privacy violation incidents.

Some services—notably [[telecommunications]], including [[Internet]]—require collecting a vast array of information about users’ activities in the course of business, and may also require consultation of these data to prepare [[Invoice|bills]]. In the US and Canada, telecom data must be kept for seven years to permit dispute and consultation about phone charges. These sensitivities have led telecom regulation to be a leader in consumer privacy regulation, enforcing a high level of confidentiality on the sensitive customer communication records.

Focusing on telecom has been outmoded to some degree as other industries also gather sensitive data. Such common commercial measures as software-based [[customer relationship management]], rewards programs, and [[target market]]ing tend to drastically increase the amount of information gathered (and sometimes shared).  These very drastically increase privacy risks and have accelerated the shift to regulation, rather than relying on the corporate desire to preserve goodwill.

== Legal protection ==
 {{chronological|date=June 2017}}

Concerns have led to consumer privacy laws in most countries, especially in the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. Notably, among developed countries, the [[United States]] has no such law and relies on corporate customer privacy disclosed in privacy policies to ensure consumer privacy in general. Modern privacy law and regulation may be compared to parts of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which includes a requirement for doctors to avoid mentioning the ills of patients to others—not only to protect them, but to protect their families— and also recognizes that innocent third parties can be harmed by the loss of control of sensitive personal information.

Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a [[telephone company]]—especially a [[monopoly]] (known in many nations as a [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTT]])—had access to unprecedented levels of information: the direct customer's communication habits and correspondents and the data of those who shared the household. Telephone operators could frequently hear conversations—inadvertently or deliberately—and their job required them to dial the exact numbers. The data gathering required for the process of billing began to become a privacy risk as well.  Accordingly, strong rules on operator behaviour, customer confidentiality, records keeping and destruction were enforced on telephone companies in every country. Typically only police and military authorities had legal powers to [[wiretap]] or see records.  Even stricter requirements emerged for various banks' electronic records In some countries, [[financial privacy]] is a major focus of the economy, with severe criminal penalties for violating it.

==1970s==
Through the 1970s many other organizations in [[developed nation]]s began to acquire sensitive data, but there were few or no regulations in place to prevent them from sharing or abusing the data.  Customer trust and goodwill were generally thought to be sufficient in first-world countries, notably the [[United States]], to ensure the protection of truly sensitive data;  ''[[caveat emptor]]'' was applied in these situations.  But in the 1980s, smaller organizations also began to get access to computer hardware and software, and these simply did not have the procedures or personnel or expertise, nor less the time, to take rigorous measures to protect their customers.  Meanwhile, via [[target marketing]] and [[rewards programs]], companies were acquiring ever more data.

Gradually, customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate data sharing, corporate mergers, employee turnover, and theft of data storage devices (e.g., [[hard drives]]) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location. Explicit regulation of consumer privacy gained further support, especially in the [[European Union]], where each nation had laws that were incompatible (e.g., some restricted the [[Data collection|collection]], some the [[Data compilation|compilation]], and some the [[Data dissemination|dissemination of data]]); it was possible to violate privacy within the EU simply doing these things from different places in the [[European Common Market]] as it existed before 1992.

==1990s==
Through the 1990s, the proliferation of [[mobile telecom]], the introduction of [[customer relationship management]], and the use of the [[Internet]] in [[developed nation]]s brought the situation to the forefront, and most countries had to implement strong consumer privacy laws, often over the objections of business. The [[European Union]] and [[New Zealand]] passed particularly strong laws that were used as a template for more limited laws in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] and some states of the [[United States]] (where no federal law for consumer privacy exists, although there are requirements specific to banking and telecom privacy). In [[Austria]] around the 1990s, the mere mention of a client's name in a semi-public social setting was enough to earn a junior bank executive a stiff jail sentence.

==2001==
After the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|terrorist attacks]] against the [[United States]] on [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|September 11, 2001,]] privacy took a back-seat to [[national security]] in legislators' minds.  Accordingly, concerns of consumer privacy in the [[United States]] have tended to go unheard of as questions of citizen privacy versus the state, and the development of a [[police state]] or [[carceral state]], have occupied advocates of strong privacy measures. Whereas it may have appeared prior to 2002 that commercial organizations and the consumer data they gathered were of primary concern, it has appeared since then in most [[developed nation]]s to be much less of a concern than [[political privacy]] and [[medical privacy]] (e.g., as violated by [[biometrics]]).  Indeed, people have recently been [[No Fly List|stopped at airports]] solely due to their political views, and there appears{{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}} to be minimal public will to stop practices of this nature.

'''Cycle time variation''' is a metric and philosophy for continuous improvement with the aim of driving down the deviations in the time it takes to produce successive units on a production line.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard J. (2001). Let's Fix It! Free Press. {{ISBN|0-7432-1551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports organizations' application of [[lean manufacturing]] or [[lean production]] by eliminating wasteful expenditure of resources. It is distinguished from some of the more common applications by its different focus of creating a structure for progressively reducing the sources of internal variation that leads to [[workarounds]] and disruption causing these [[wastes]] to accumulate in the first place.  Although it is often used as an indicator of lean progress, its use promotes a structured approach to reducing disruption that impacts efficiency, quality, and value.&lt;ref name=breaking&gt;Ruffa, Stephen A.; Michael J.

{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Edict of Expulsion''' was a royal decree issued by King [[Edward I of England]] on 18 July 1290, expelling all [[Jew]]s from the [[Kingdom of England]]. The expulsion edict remained in force for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]]. The edict was not an isolated incident, but the culmination of over 200 years of increased persecution. The edict was overturned during [[the Protectorate]] more than 350 years later, when [[Oliver Cromwell]] [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|permitted Jews to return to England]] in 1657. King Edward I advised Sheriffs of all Counties he wanted all Jews expelled by no later than [[All Saints' Day|All Saints' Day (1st November)]] of the year the decree was issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/350.shtml Ireland’s Readmission of Jews to Britain 1656, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first Jewish communities of significant size came to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; After the conquest of England, William instituted a [[feudal system]] in the country, whereby all estates formally belonged to [[The Crown#Origins|the Crown]]; the king then appointed lords over these vast estates, but they were subject to duties and obligations (financial and military) to the king. Under the lords were other subjects such as [[serfs]], who were bound and obliged to their lords, and to their lords' obligations. Merchants had a special status in the system, as did Jews. Jews were declared to be direct subjects of the king,&lt;ref name="Glassman_1975_14"&gt;{{harvnb|Glassman|1975|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the rest of the population. This was an ambivalent legal position for the Jewish population, in that they were not tied to any particular lord but were subject to the whims of the king, it could be either advantageous or disadvantageous. Every successive king formally reviewed a [[royal charter]], granting Jews the right to remain in England. Jews did not enjoy any of the guarantees of the [[Magna Carta]]&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_36"&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenstein|1996|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of 1215.

Economically, Jews played a key role in the country. The Church then strictly forbade the [[usury|lending of money for profit]], creating a vacuum in the economy of Europe that Jews filled because of extreme discrimination in every other economic area. [[Canon law]] was not considered applicable to Jews, and [[loans and interest in Judaism|Judaism does not forbid loans with interest between Jews and non-Jews]].&lt;ref name="Parkes_1976_303"&gt;{{harvnb|Parkes|1976|p=303}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of their unique status as his direct subjects, the King could appropriate Jewish assets in the form of taxation. He levied heavy taxes on Jews at will, without having to summon [[Parliament of England|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_37"&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenstein|1996|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reputation of Jews as extortionate money-lenders arose,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} which made them extremely unpopular with both the Church and the general public. While an anti-Jewish attitude was wide-spread in Europe, medieval England was particularly anti-Jewish.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_36"/&gt; An image of the Jew as a diabolical figure who hated Christ started to become wide-spread, and myths such as the tale of the [[Wandering Jew]] and [[Blood libel|allegations of ritual murders]] originated and spread throughout England as well as in Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref name="Glassman_1975_17"&gt;{{harvnb|Glassman|1975|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In frequent cases of [[blood libel]], Jews were said to hunt for children to murder before [[Passover]] so that they could use their blood to make the unleavened [[matzah]].&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_39"&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenstein|1996|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Jewish attitudes sparked numerous riots in which many Jews were murdered, most notably in 1190, when [[History of the Jews in England#Persecution and expulsion|over 100 Jews were massacred in York]].&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_39"/&gt;

==Expulsion==
[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]
The situation only got worse for Jews as the 13th century progressed. In 1218, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] of England proclaimed the Edict of the Badge requiring Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|marking badge]].&lt;ref name="Glassman_1975_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Glassman|1975|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taxation grew increasingly intense. Between 1219–1272, 49 levies were imposed on Jews for a total of 200,000 [[Mark (currency)#England and Scotland|mark]]s, a vast sum of money.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_37"/&gt; Henry III imposed greater segregation and reinforced the wearing of badges in the 1253 [[Statute of Jewry]]. He endorsed the myth of Jewish child murders. Meanwhile, his court and major Barons bought Jewish debts with the intention of securing lands of lesser nobles through defaults. The [[Second Barons' War]] in the 1260s brought a series of pogroms aimed at destroying the evidence of these debts and Jewish communities in major towns, including London, where 500 Jews died, [[Worcester]], [[Canterbury]] and many other towns.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major step towards expulsion took place in 1275, with the [[Statute of the Jewry]]. The statute outlawed all lending at interest and gave Jews fifteen years to readjust.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_345"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gascony|duchy of Gascony]] in 1287, King Edward ordered the local Jews expelled.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_306"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All their property was seized by the crown and all outstanding debts payable to Jews were transferred to the King’s name.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_346"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he returned to England in 1289, King Edward was deeply in debt.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_307"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next summer he summoned his knights to impose a steep tax. To make the tax more palatable, Edward, in exchange, essentially offered to expel all Jews.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_343"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=343}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heavy tax was passed, and three days later, on 18 July,&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Hebrew calendar]], this date was 9 Av ([[Tisha B'Av]]) 5050.&lt;/ref&gt; the Edict of Expulsion was issued.

One official reason for the expulsion was that Jews had declined to follow the Statute of Jewry and continued to practice usury. This is quite likely, as it would have been extremely hard for many Jews to take up the "respectable" occupations demanded by the Statute. The edict of expulsion was widely popular and met with little resistance, and the expulsion was quickly carried out.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Jewish population in England at the time was relatively small, perhaps 2,000 people, although estimates vary.&lt;ref&gt;Mundill, Robin R. (2002) ''England's Jewish Solution: Experiment and Expulsion, 1262–1290'', pg. 27. Cambridge University Press; {{ISBN|0-521-52026-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The expulsion process appears to have been relatively non-violent, although there were some accounts to the contrary. One perhaps apocryphal story told of a captain taking a ship full of Jews to the [[Thames]], en route to France, while the tide was low, and convincing them to go out for a walk with him. He then lost them and made it back to his ship quickly before the tide came back in, leaving them all to drown.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_346"/&gt;

Many Jews emigrated, to Scotland, France and the Netherlands, and as far as [[History of the Jews in Poland|Poland]], which, at that time, protected them (see [[Statute of Kalisz]]).

==Intermediate period==
Between the expulsion of Jews in 1290 and their [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|formal return]] in 1655, there are records of Jews in the [[Domus Conversorum]] up to 1551 and even later. An attempt was made to obtain a revocation of the edict of expulsion as early as 1310, but in vain. Notwithstanding, a certain number of Jews appeared to have returned; for complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as [[Lombard banking|Lombards]] were actually Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolls of Parliament|Rotuli Parliamentorum]]'' ii. 332a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally permits were given to individuals to visit England, as in the case of Dr Elias Sabot (an eminent physician from [[Bologna]] summoned to attend [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]) in 1410, but it was not until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497 that any considerable number of [[Sephardic Jew]]s found refuge in England. In 1542 many were arrested on the suspicion of being Jews, and throughout the sixteenth century a number of persons named Lopez, possibly all of the same family, took refuge in England, the best known of them being [[Rodrigo López (physician)|Rodrigo López]], physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], and who is said by some commentators to have been the inspiration for [[Shylock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Greenblatt|first=S.|year=2004|title=Will In The World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare|location=New York|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=0-393-05057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England also saw converts like [[Immanuel Tremellius]] and [[Philip Ferdinand]]. Jewish visitors included [[Joachim Gaunse]], who introduced new methods of mining into England and there are records of visits from Jews called Alonzo de Herrera and Simon Palache in 1614. The writings of [[John Weemes]] in the 1630s provided a positive view of the resettlement of Jews in England, effected in 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=John|date=1949-01-01|year=|title=A Seventeenth Century Bill of "Rights" for Jews|jstor=1453260|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=39|issue=4|pages=379–389|doi=10.2307/1453260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.&lt;ref name=gawdy&gt;{{cite book|title=Limited Wants, Unlimited Means: A reader on Hunter-Gatherer Economics and the Environment|author=John Gowdy|year=1998|publisher=Island Press|location=St Louis|isbn=1-55963-555-X|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahlberg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dahlberg, Frances.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eTPULzP1MZAC&amp;pg=PA120|title=Woman the Gatherer|location=London|publisher=Yale university press|year=1975|isbn=0-300-02989-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. &amp; Whiten, A.

== Forms ==
Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include [[communism]], [[Equality before the law|legal egalitarianism]], [[luck egalitarianism]], [[political egalitarianism]], [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]], [[racial equality]], [[equality of outcome]] and [[Christian egalitarianism]]. Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.

=== Legal egalitarianism ===
{{details|equality before the law}}
One argument is that [[liberalism]] provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, José María. "Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy." 20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy. Web: 12 March 2010. [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Poli/PoliRosa.htm Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equality of person ====
The [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights of 1689]] and the [[United States Constitution]] use only the term "person" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities, except for (a) a reference to "men" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason; and (b) a rule of  proportional Congressional representation in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

As the rest of the Constitution, in its operative language the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] uses the term "person" stating, for example, that "[...] nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".

==== Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities ====
An example of this form is the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] which provides that "men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties".

==== Gender equality ====
The motto "''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''" was used during the [[French Revolution]] and is still used as an official motto of the French government. The 1789 [[Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind.

The [[Declaration of Independence of the United States]] is an example of an assertion of equality of men, the wording of "men" and "man" is a reference to both men and women i.e. "mankind" [[all men are created equal]]". [[John Locke]] is sometimes considered the founder of this form.

Many state constitutions in the United States also use "rights of man" language rather than "rights of person" since the noun "man" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women.{{citation needed|reason= sources needed both for the "always" bit and that it is the reason state constutions chose to say man rather than persons|date=June 2018}}

It is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women.

=== Social egalitarianism ===
At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[social anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[left-libertarianism]], and [[progressivism]], some of which propound [[economic egalitarianism]]. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among [[intellectualism|intellectuals]] and in the general populations of many countries. However, whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question. Anti-egalitarianism&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, et al. "Social dominance orientation, anti‐egalitarianism and the political psychology of gender: an extension and cross‐cultural replication." European Journal of Social Psychology 30.1 (2000): 41-67.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[elitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englishthesaurus.net/antonym/egalitarian/ |title=Antonyms for egalitarian |last= |first= |date= |website=English Thesaurus |publisher= |access-date=28 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is opposition to egalitarianism.

{{anchor|Finance|Financial|Economics|Economic egalitarianism}}

==== Economic ====
A very early example of equality of what might be described as outcome economic egalitarianism is the Chinese philosophy of [[agriculturalism]], which held that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self sufficiency.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011|page=38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[socialism]], [[social ownership]] of [[means of production]] is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership, the [[surplus product]] generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist [[Karl Marx]] is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. However, Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#KarMarEquRig|title=Egalitarianism|author=|date=16 August 2002|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American economist [[John Roemer]] has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of [[distributive justice]], shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be [[To each according to his contribution|proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production]] is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.&lt;ref name="Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions, 2008"&gt;''Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions'', by Roemer, John. 2008. Eastern Economic Journal, vol. 34, issue 1, pp. 14–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egalitarianism and non-human animals ===
Many philosophers, including Ingmar Persson,&lt;ref&gt;Persson, I. (1993) “A basis for (interspecies) equality”, in Cavalieri, P. &amp; Singer, P. (eds.) The Great Ape Project, New York: St. Martin’s Press, pp. 183-193.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Vallentyne]],&lt;ref&gt;Vallentyne, P. (2005) “Of mice and men: Equality and animals”, Journal of Ethics, 9, pp. 403-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Holtug,&lt;ref&gt;Holtug, N. (2007) “Equality for animals,” in Ryberg, J.; Petersen, T. S. &amp; Wolf, C. (eds.) New waves in applied ethics, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Gompertz]]&lt;ref&gt;Gompertz, L. (1997 [1824]) Moral inquiries on the situation of man and of brutes, London: Open Gate.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well. Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that "Egalitarianism implies rejecting [[speciesism]], and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals" and that we should aid [[wild animal suffering|animals suffering in nature]].&lt;ref name="Horta2014"&gt;Horta, Oscar (2014) "Egalitarianism and Animals," Between the Species: Vol. 19: Iss. 1, Article 5.
Available at: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Horta argues that "because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests of nonhuman animals."&lt;ref name="Horta2014" /&gt;

=== Religious and spiritual egalitarianism ===
==== Sikhism ====
The [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith was founded upon egalitarian principles, reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race, but also between the genders. This equality led to denunciation of [[Sati (practice)|sati]], the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the [[Pyre|funeral pyres]] of deceased husband, but which actually occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation over becoming the bounty of war for the Central Asians that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God. Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism, many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism, with greater rigidity than the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] archetype from which the practice was inherited.&lt;ref name="Darshan, S. T 2013"&gt;Darshan, S. T. "7 Sikhism and development: a perfect match?." Handbook of Research on Development and Religion (2013): 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the rhetoric of equality, scholars have "found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes".&lt;ref name="Darshan, S. T 2013"/&gt; Furthermore, despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism, denouncing sexism, female infanticide, dowry, sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolation—the reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent, like [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;Singh, I. J. "What sikhism says about gender and sex." International Sikh Conferences. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christianity ====
{{Main|Christian egalitarianism|Christian communism|Christian universalism}}
The [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarian]] view holds that the [[Bible]] teaches the fundamental equality of people of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes and all age groups, but within the teachings and example of [[Jesus Christ]], [[God in Christianity|God]] and the overarching principles of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the wide range of [[Christianity]] there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups, some of which are [[Complementarianism|complementarians]]. There are many{{who|date=June 2018}} that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure (for example, parents having authority over their children and husbands authority over their wives). These ideas are considered by some{{who|date=June 2018}} to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism.

==== Judaism ====
[[Judaism]] is a [[Universalism|universalist]] religion due to the belief that one God created the entire universe. A further distinction has to be made however. Judaism teaches that [[Jews]] (defined as either the biological descendants of [[Jacob]] "Israel", the son of Isaac and grandson of [[Abraham]] or someone who converted) have a specific covenant with [[God in Judaism|God]] as a [[chosen people]] ([[Deutoronomy]] 7:6 "chosen as God's [[Jews as the chosen people|treasured people]]") to serve as an example of [[Divine light|God's light]] to the rest of the world. The oral Torah and [[Rabbinic literature]] codified in the [[Talmud]] makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the [[gentile]]s (literally, "the nations"). However, Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. In this aspect, Judaism is universalist in its divine message, but not in its religious obligations. In [[Reform Judaism|reform]] and [[conservative Judaism]], egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations. [[Synagogue]]s that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating (i.e. no [[mechitza]]) and allow women to lead [[Jewish prayer|services]] with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the [[Torah]].

==== Islam ====
The [[Islam]]ic stance on equality stresses that all humans are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of gender, class and race. The [[Quran]] states: "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted".  Louise Marlow's ''Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought'' compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4311272?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104297963707 |title=Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought by Louise Marlow |last1=Poonawala |first1=Ismail K. |date=Summer 1999 |website=www.jstor.org |publisher=Iranian Studies Vol. 32, No. 3 (Summer, 1999), pp. 405–407|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern egalitarianism theory ===
Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically, politically and socially. Modern egalitarianism theory (or&amp;nbsp; "new egalitarianism") outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost, then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other. In essence, the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talents—these differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.millenium.itesm.mx/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=f2c02b96-fed4-4085-a57d-9fef664ae057%40sessionmgr101|title=Egalitarianism:Fair and Equal?

== Reception {{anchor|criticisms}} ==
The [[cultural theory of risk]] holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules and principles; and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with [[fatalism]] termed as its opposite.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"/&gt; The theory distinguishes between [[hierarchy|hierarchists]], who are positive towards both rules and groups; and egalitarianists, who are positive towards groups, but negative towards rules.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"&gt;Thompson et al., ''Cultural Theory'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; This is by definition a form of "anarchist equality" as referred to by [[Alexander Berkman|Berkman]]. The fabric of an "egalitarianist society" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, [[Individualism|individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomism|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"/&gt; Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.

[[Alexander Berkman]] suggests that "equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman ''What is Anarchism?'' pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxism ===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that a revolution would bring about a [[Socialism|socialist]] society which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist]] stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".

However, [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of "equality"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires—thus Marx's notion of [[communist society]] is radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: "Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes&amp;nbsp;... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: "[[To each according to his contribution]]" and "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.&lt;ref name="Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987"&gt;''Rejecting Egalitarianism'', by Nielsen, Kai. 1987. Political Theory, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1987), pp. 411–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnic penalty''' in [[sociology]] is defined as the economic and non-economic disadvantages that [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] experience in the [[Labour economics|labour market]] compared to other ethnic groups. As an area of study among [[behavioral economics|behavioral economists]], psychologists, and sociologists, it ranges beyond discrimination to take non-cognitive factors into consideration for explaining unwarranted differences between individuals of similar abilities but differing ethnicities.

==Overview==
The concept of the ethnic penalty was first discussed by Oxford sociologist Anthony Heath and refined with greater specificity by another Oxford sociologist, Reza Hasmath and, recently, by another sociologist, Elyakim Kislev. Heath originally looked at the ethnic penalty by making comparisons between two groups in Britain, [[White British|whites]] and [[Black British|blacks]], noting that unemployment of black African men was twice as high as unemployment of white men.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A.F. and J. Ridge (1983) “Social Mobility of Ethnic Minorities”, ''Journal of Biosocial Science'', Supplement No. 8: 169-184.&lt;/ref&gt; Using 2001 UK census data, Johnston et al. suggests that all ethno-religious groups in the UK experienced ethnic penalties in the labour market, with the exception of White British ethno-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R. et al.

(2006) "Ethnic Minority Populations and the Labour Market: An Analysis of the 1991 and 2001 Census", Department for Work and Pensions.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, Simpson et al. confirmed that this disadvantage is not tied to "concentration of ethnic minorities in deprived areas"; those of an "ethnic minority were still twice as likely to be unemployed than their White counterparts... even in areas that are predominantly White". Furthermore, ethnic minorities experience economic disadvantages even in some areas where their level of educational attainments outperform or are on par with that of the majority population, as is the case in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|date=2007|title=The Paradox of Ethnic Minority Development in Beijing|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/2/|journal=Comparative Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=466|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the education levels of ethnic minorities largely match those of the Han population, yet Hans dominate the demographics of high-wage, high-education and skills-intensive employment sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|date=2007|title=The Paradox of Ethnic Minority Development in Beijing|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/2/|journal=Comparative Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=466|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research into the process of minority job acquisition and retention in China finds that "minorities perceive they are at a disadvantage in the job search process," even if Han-minority wage differentials show little evidence of disadvantages for ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|last2=Ho|first2=Benjamin|date=2015|title=Job Acquisition, Retention, and Outcomes for Ethnic Minorities in Urban China|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/9/|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|language=en|volume=56|issue=1|pages=24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has explored the possibility of a "double penalty" which considers the interaction effects of ethnicity and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherng|first=Hua-Yu Sebastian|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|last3=Ho|first3=Benjamin|date=2016|title=The Double Penalty?

Reza Hasmath concludes that exclusionary [[discrimination]] is not the only potential explanation for ethnic penalties. Conditions such an individual's social network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/lack-of-network-hurting-migrant-workers-20120603-1zq3u.html|title=Lack of network hurting migrant workers|last=May|first=Julia|date=4 June 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a firm's working culture, and a community's social trust should be strongly factored.&lt;ref&gt;Hasmath, R.

Retrieved 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Silberman and Fournier, in their investigation of ethnic penalty in France, also highlight that an employer may not necessarily wish themselves to discriminate, but that they may be pressured by "a given company’s employees or a customer wishing to have nothing to do with an individual with this or that characteristic".&lt;ref name="Revue"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-francaise-de-sociologie-2008-5-page-45.htm | title=Second Generations on the Job Market in France: A Persistent Ethnic Penalty - A Contribution to Segmented Assimilation Theory |author1=Silberman, R.  |author2=Fournier, I. | journal=Revue Française de Sociologie | year=2008 | volume=49 | issue=5 | pages=45–94 | accessdate=24 November 2014 | doi=10.3917/rfs.495.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elyakim Kislev's work divides the ethnic penalty into four components: individual characteristics, country characteristics, the social environment in host country, and the policy environment in host country. Kislev shows that the main reasons for immigrants’ disadvantage in terms of labor force participation and household income are both origin and host country characteristics, while the effects of ethnic origins, social exclusion, and policies are weaker. However, ethnic origins and social exclusion actually play a central role in determining unemployment of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kislev|first=Elyakim|date=2016-09-19|title=Deciphering the ‘Ethnic Penalty’ of Immigrants in Western Europe: A Cross-Classified Multilevel Analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308032232_Deciphering_the_%27Ethnic_Penalty%27_of_Immigrants_in_Western_Europe_A_Cross-Classified_Multilevel_Analysis|journal=Social Indicators Research|doi=10.1007/s11205-016-1451-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7861">'''Geometric mechanics''' is a branch of mathematics applying particular geometric methods to many areas of mechanics, from mechanics of particles and [[rigid body mechanics|rigid bodies]] to [[fluid mechanics]] to [[control theory]].

Geometric mechanics applies principally to systems for which the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] is a [[Lie group]], or a group of [[diffeomorphism]]s, or more generally where some aspect of the configuration space has this group structure. For example, the configuration space of a rigid body such as a satellite is the group of Euclidean motions (translations and rotations in space), while the configuration space for a liquid crystal is the group of diffeomorphisms coupled with an internal state (gauge symmetry or order parameter).

== Momentum map and reduction ==
One of the principal ideas of geometric mechanics is ''reduction'', which goes back to Jacobi's elimination of the node in the 3-body problem, but in its modern form is due to K. Meyer (1973) and independently J.E. Marsden and A. Weinstein (1974), both inspired by the work of Smale (1970).  Symmetry of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian system gives rise to conserved quantities, by [[Noether's theorem]], and these conserved quantities are the components of the [[momentum map]] '''J'''.  If ''P'' is the phase space and ''G'' the symmetry group, the momentum map is a map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}:P\to\mathfrak{g}^*&lt;/math&gt;, and the reduced spaces are quotients of the level sets of '''J''' by the subgroup of ''G'' preserving the level set in question: for &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\mathfrak{g}^*&lt;/math&gt; one defines &lt;math&gt;P_\mu=\mathbf{J}^{-1}(\mu)/G_\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and this reduced space is a symplectic manifold if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a regular value of ''J''.

== Geometric integrators ==
One of the important developments arising from the geometric approach to mechanics is the incorporation of the geometry into numerical methods.
In particular symplectic and variational integrators are proving particularly accurate for long-term integration of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems.

== History ==
As a modern subject, geometric mechanics has its roots in four works written in the 1960s. These were by [[Vladimir Arnold]] (1966),  [[Stephen Smale]] (1970) and [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] (1970), and the first edition of Abraham and Marsden's ''Foundation of Mechanics'' (1967). Arnold's fundamental work showed that Euler's equations for the free rigid body are the equations for geodesic flow on the rotation group SO(3) and carried this geometric insight over to the dynamics of ideal fluids, where the rotation group is replaced by the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms.  Smale's paper on Topology and Mechanics investigates the conserved quantities arising from Noether's theorem when a Lie group of symmetries acts on a mechanical system, and defines what is now called the momentum map (which Smale calls angular momentum), and he raises questions about the topology of the energy-momentum level surfaces and the effect on the dynamics.  In his book, Souriau also considers the conserved quantities arising from the action of a group of symmetries, but he concentrates more on the geometric structures involved (for example the equivariance properties of this momentum for a wide class of symmetries), and less on questions of dynamics.

These ideas, and particularly those of Smale were central in the second edition of ''Foundations of Mechanics'' (Abraham and Marsden, 1978).

'''Gestalt psychology''' or '''gestaltism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɔː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɔː|l|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gestalt "gestalt"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Gestalt}} {{IPA-de|ɡəˈʃtalt|}} "shape, form") is a philosophy of mind of the [[Berlin School of experimental psychology]]. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a [[holism|global whole]] with self-organizing tendencies.

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts. The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist [[Kurt Koffka]], "the whole is ''something else'' than the sum of its parts"&lt;ref&gt;Koffka 1935, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; is often incorrectly translated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuck|first=Michael|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/gestalt-principles-applied-in-design/|title=Gestalt Principles Applied in Design |date=Aug 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The whole is ''greater'' than the sum of its parts", and thus used when explaining gestalt theory, and further incorrectly applied to [[systems theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hothersall: ''History of Psychology'', chapter seven, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Koffka did not like the translation. He firmly corrected students who replaced "other" with "greater". "This is not a principle of addition" he said.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, F. 1977. Cited in Dewey, R.A. 2007. [http://www.intropsych.com/ch04_senses/whole_is_other_than_the_sum_of_the_parts.html Psychology: An introduction: Chapter four - The Whole is Other than the Sum of the Parts]. Retrieved 4/12/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole has an independent existence.

In the study of [[perception]], Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perceptions are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the [[behaviorist]] approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the ''organization'' of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). Our brain is capable of generating whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).

In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]]. Gestalt theory, it is proposed, allows for the deconstruction of the whole situation into its elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = G | year = 1924 | title = The psychology of the gestalt | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 7| pages = 401–412 | doi = 10.1037/h0070207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept of gestalt was first introduced in philosophy and psychology in 1890 by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (a member of the [[School of Brentano]]). The idea of gestalt has its roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Max Wertheimer]]'s unique contribution was to insist that the "gestalt" is perceptually primary, defining the parts it was composed from, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels's earlier ''Gestalt-Qualität'' had been.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively. On the philosophical foundations of these ideas see Foundations of Gestalt Theory (Smith, ed., 1988).

Early 20th century theorists, such as [[Kurt Koffka]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] (students of [[Carl Stumpf]]) saw objects as perceived within an environment according to all of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of [[perception]]—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It is based on the here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure or ground]]. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.

These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. Although gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive,&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl/&gt; it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects (Carlson et al. 2000), and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.

===Gestalt therapy===
The founders of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893–1933. Expressionism – Psychonalysis – Judaism'', 2010, p. 190, EHP Verlag Andreas Kohlhage, Bergisch Gladbach.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term "Gestalt" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object to it;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.&lt;ref&gt;Allen R. Barlow,  [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm "Gestalt-Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident"], ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, (Fall, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of gestalt psychology.

Mary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is ''not'' Gestalt psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Henle 1975: [http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'']; Presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Chicago, September 1975. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 14, pp 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt; With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.&lt;ref&gt;See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt – Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe, e.g. [[Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy]].

==Theoretical framework and methodology==
The school of gestalt practiced a series of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.

The theoretical principles are the following:
* '''Principle of Totality'''—The conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships.
* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' – A [[correlation]] exists between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.

Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:
* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''—In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.
* '''Biotic experiment'''—The school of gestalt established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [[fidelity]], what would be habitual for a subject.&lt;ref&gt;William Ray Woodward, Robert Sonné Cohen – World views and scientific discipline formation: science studies in the German Democratic Republic : papers from a German-American summer institute, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from cybernetics and neurology==
In the 1940s and 1950s, [[laboratory]] research in [[neurology]] and what became known as [[cybernetics]] on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that [[perception]] of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts ''in motion'') is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:

:A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.&lt;ref&gt;Lettvin, J.Y., Maturana, H.R., Pitts, W.H., and McCulloch, W.S. (1961). Two Remarks on the Visual System of the Frog. In Sensory Communication edited by Walter Rosenblith, MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of [[perception]] of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, "fixes" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image "marks time" in the vicinity of this point.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Fedorovich Turchin – The phenomenon of science – a cybernetic approach to human evolution – Columbia University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, [[multistability]] and [[wikt:invariance|invariance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52051454|title=The World in your Head: A Gestalt View of the Mechanism of Conscious Experience|last=Steven.|first=Lehar,|date=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=0805841768|location=Mahwah, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52051454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===
This is demonstrated by the ''dog picture'', which depicts a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] dog sniffing the ground in the shade of overhanging trees. The dog is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts.  Instead, the dog appears as a whole, all at once. Gestalt theory does not have an explanation for how this perception of a dog appears.

===Reification===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reification]] --&gt;
{{See also|Reification (fallacy)}}

[[Image:Reification.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Reification]]

Reification is the ''constructive'' or ''generative'' aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.

For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture '''A''', though no triangle is there. In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as "belonging" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.

Reification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as "real" contours.

===Multistability===
[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|the [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]

[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.

{{clear left}}

===Invariance===
[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]

Invariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.

Emergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archivedate=2012-02-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Prägnanz''==
{{Main|Principles of grouping}}

The fundamental principle of gestalt [[perception]] is the law of ''{{ill|prägnanz|de|Prägnanz|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in the German language, ''pithiness''), which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple.  Gestalt [[psychologist]]s attempt to discover refinements of the law of ''prägnanz'', and this involves writing down [[laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called "gestalt laws".&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]© 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]
[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]
[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]
[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb]]
A major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as whole rather than the sum of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.  The various laws are called ''laws'' or ''principles'', depending on the paper where they appear—but for simplicity's sake, this article uses the term ''laws''. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman – GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].

# '''Law of Proximity'''—The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure that illustrates the Law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups.  Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soegaard&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Similarity'''—The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Closure'''—The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Symmetry'''—The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Common Fate'''—The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.&lt;ref name=todorvic&gt;{{cite web|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles |website=Scholarpedia.org |publisher=[[Scholarpedia]] |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Continuity'''—The law of continuity states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;
# '''Law of Good Gestalt'''—The law of good gestalt explains that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the '''law of Prägnanz'''.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;  Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean "pithiness" and implies the ideas of salience, conciseness and orderliness.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;
# '''Law of Past Experience'''—The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters "L" and "I" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016&gt;{{citation| author=Jäkel, F., Singh, M., Wichmann, F. A., &amp; Herzog, M. H. | year=2016 | title=An overview of quantitative approaches in Gestalt perception. | journal=Vision Research | volume=126 | pages=3–8 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2016.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many [[Physiology|physiological]] assumptions made by gestaltists&lt;ref name=Schultz2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Schultz | first = Duane | title = A History of Modern Psychology | publisher = Elsevier Science | location = Burlington | year = 2013 | page = 291 | isbn = 1483270084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016/&gt;

In some scholarly communities, such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[computational neuroscience]], gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being ''descriptive'' rather than ''explanatory'' in nature.  For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, [[Vicki Bruce|Bruce]], Green &amp; Georgeson&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce, V., Green, P. &amp; Georgeson, M. |title=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology |publisher=LEA |year=1996 | edition=3rd |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude the following regarding gestalt theory's influence on the study of visual perception:
{{quote|text=The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their "laws" of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a "good" or "simple" shape, for example? | author=Bruce, Green &amp; Georgeson | source=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology}}

==Gestalt views in psychology==
Gestalt psychologists find it is important to think of problems as a whole. Max Wertheimer considered thinking to happen in two ways: productive and reproductive.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych2"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Fourth Edition, Thomas Wadsworth© 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Productive thinking''' is solving a problem with insight.

This is a quick insightful unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction.

'''Reproductive thinking''' is solving a problem with previous experiences and what is already known.  (1945/1959).

This is a very common thinking. For example, when a person is given several segments of information, he/she '''deliberately''' examines the relationships among its parts, analyzes their purpose, concept, and totality, he/she reaches the "aha!" moment, using what is already known. Understanding in this case happens '''intentionally''' by reproductive thinking.

Another gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:
# Unconscious leap in thinking.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"/&gt;
# The increased amount of speed in mental processing.
# The amount of short-circuiting that occurs in normal reasoning.&lt;ref name="gpsych"&gt;Langley&amp; associates, 1987; Perkins, 1981; Weisberg, 1986,1995"&lt;/ref&gt;

Views going against the gestalt psychology are:
# [[Insight phenomenology|Nothing-special view]]
# Neo-gestalt view
# [[The Three-Process View]]

Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the [[gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]], which is only peripherally linked to gestalt psychology. A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-Jürgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], a dual process model of memory and reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|title=A new institutionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=Lauren|title=Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions|journal= Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems |year=2014|pages=163–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in design==
The gestalt laws are used in [[user interface design]]. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing [[radio button]]s. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard |first=Mads |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html |title=Gestalt principles of form perception |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum cognition modeling==
{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}

Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that "similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment. ''Synthese'', October 1993, Volume 97, Issue 1, pp 125–156; Das Gestaltproblem in der Chemie: Die Entstehung molekularer Form unter dem Einfluß der Umgebung, ''Gestalt Theory, 1992, 14(4), 228-265.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist Elio Conte and co-workers have proposed abstract, mathematical models to describe the time dynamics of [[Association (psychology)|cognitive associations]] with mathematical tools borrowed from [[quantum mechanics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conte | first1 = Elio | last2 = Todarello | first2 = Orlando | last3 = Federici | first3 = Antonio | last4 = Vitiello | first4 = Francesco | last5 = Lopane | first5 = Michele | last6 = Khrennikov | first6 = Andrei | last7 = Zbilut | first7 = Joseph P. | year = 2007 | title = Some remarks on an experiment suggesting quantum-like behavior of cognitive entities and formulation of an abstract quantum mechanical formalism to describe cognitive entity and its dynamics | url = | journal = Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1076–1088 | doi = 10.1016/j.chaos.2005.09.061 |arxiv=0710.5092 | bibcode = 2007CSF....31.1076C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elio Conte, Orlando Todarello, Antonio Federici, Francesco Vitiello, Michele Lopane, Andrei Khrennikov: A Preliminary Evidence of Quantum Like Behavior in Measurements of Mental States, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307201 arXiv:quant-ph/0307201] (submitted 28 July 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and has discussed psychology experiments in this context. A similar approach has been suggested by physicists [[David Bohm]], [[Basil Hiley]] and philosopher [[Paavo Pylkkänen]] with the notion that [[Thought#The mind-body problem|mind and matter]] both emerge from [[Implicate and explicate order#A common grounding for consciousness and matter|an "implicate order"]].&lt;ref&gt;B.J. Hiley: ''Particles, fields, and observers'', Volume I The Origins of Life, Part 1 Origin and Evolution of Life, Section II The Physical and Chemical Basis of Life, pp. 87–106 ([http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/Frontiersoflife.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil J. Hiley, Paavo Pylkkänen: ''Naturalizing the mind in a quantum framework''. In Paavo Pylkkänen and Tere Vadén (eds.): Dimensions of conscious experience, Advances in Consciousness Research, Volume 37, John Benjamins B.V., 2001, {{ISBN|90-272-5157-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=CCX1NhhpQNQC&amp;pg=PA119 pages 119-144]&lt;/ref&gt; The models involve non-[[commutative property|commutative]] mathematics; such models account for situations in which the outcome of two measurements performed one after the other can depend on the order in which they are performed—a pertinent feature for psychological processes, as an experiment performed on a conscious person may influence the outcome of a subsequent experiment by changing the state of mind of that person.

'''GreenMantra Technologies''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[clean technology]] company based in [[Brantford, Ontario]], that converts recycled [[waste plastics]] into polymers, additives, and other chemicals for industrial use.

== Background ==

GreenMantra Technologies has developed a thermo-catalytic system and patented manufacturing process that allows the conversion of waste plastics such as grocery bags, film and foam, into high-value waxes, [[polymers]] and other specialty chemicals. The company’s end products, which are sold under the Ceranovus brand name, are [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] additives that can be custom-formulated for specific physical and performance characteristics. These products have applications in coatings, inks, plastics processing, [[adhesives]], rubber compounding and asphalt modification for roofing and paving. GreenMantra's original technologies were developed by Dr. Anil Kumar and Pushkar Kumar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marsdd.com/news-and-insights/greenmantra-technologies-transforming-recycled-plastics-into-industrial-waxes/|title=GreenMantra Technologies: Transforming recycled plastics into industrial waxes |last=Minelli |first=Jennifer |date=5 February 2013 |website=MarsDD |publisher= |access-date=15 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, the company will be launching a line of styrenic polymers.

==Overview==
American Jewelry and Loan is owned by [[Les Gold]], a third generation pawnbroker and businessman, and the grandson of a pawnbroker who once owned Sam's Loans, a now-defunct pawnshop on [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|Michigan Avenue]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Gold at Gunpoint |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= [[truTV]] |date= September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Les first opened American Jewelry at the Green Eight Shopping Center on 8 Mile Road in [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]] in 1978, moving to its present location in 1993.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;

In 2011, American Jewelry expanded to its second location when it acquired Premier Jewelry and Loan in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]];&lt;ref name=ajl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanjewelryonline.com |title= Pawn Detroit |publisher= American Jewelry and Loan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Name of pawn shop acquired revealed in the  episode "Aftermath",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Aftermath |date= November 15, 2011 |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= truTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its address matched between American Jewelry's website&lt;ref name=ajl/&gt; and Premiere Jewelry's Yelp listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yelp.com/biz/premier-jewelry-and-loan-pontiac |title= Premier Jewelry &amp; Loan |work= Yelp }}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=name|group=lower-alpha}} the new location was featured in the first few episodes of ''Hardcore Pawn''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fifth season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Total Meltdown End Days |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= truTV |date= October 4, 2011}} At the end of this episode, Les tells Seth and Ashley that he plans on opening a second location, with one of them running it.&lt;/ref&gt; and in two episodes of the sixth season, where Les's son and co-owner/employee Seth attempts to sell the Pontiac location behind Les's back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Oh No He Didn't |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= truTV |date= September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Oh Yes He Did |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= truTV |date= October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Les's only son, Seth, is an alumnus of the [[University of Michigan]] and has been a co-owner of American Jewelry since graduating from school. Seth handles the store's [[marketing|marketing division]] and claims that if it was not for him, the shop's only marketing campaign would be "an ad in the [[Yellow Pages]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Pilot #1 |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= truTV |date= December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Les's daughter, Ashley, has a bachelor's degree in business administration from [[Michigan State University]] and earned her graduate diamond certification from the Gemological Institute of America. Ashley is a co-owner of American Jewelry and has been working there for more than fifteen years, although she took three years off at one point for [[maternity leave]]. The [[sibling rivalry]] between her and Seth is a common element of many episodes.&lt;ref name="bios"&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/shows/hardcore-pawn/bios.html Hardcore Pawn: Biographies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings response==
The show averaged 2.6 million viewers during its sixth season.&lt;ref name=Gail&gt;{{cite web|last=Pennington|first=Gail|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/hardcore-pawn-picked-up-for-season/article_25550ae0-3d28-5db1-b745-82f667e81e81.html|title=''Hardcore Pawn'' picked up for Season 7|publisher=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' via website|date=January 25, 2013|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==

* Seth Gold, Les' son,  co-owner
* Ashley Gold Broad, Les' daughter,  co-owner, head of Jewelry department. Left the pawn shop after series concluded to start her own online jewelery business
*Lili Gold, Les' wife and office manager. Appears occasionally in the background during the first season, but is never seen or mentioned thereafter
* Karen Mitchel, Les' niece, co-manager—jewelry department (Seasons 8–9)
* Bobby Janiec ("Bobby J"), store employee. Left pawn shop early in 2016 and has since posted in various social media accounts that he feels he was taken advantage of owner Les Gold.

* Rich, Store Manager (Seasons 1–6). Store Manager for 25 years. Plays in a rock band on the side. Was sent home by Les in a controversial episode for an apparently a minor dispute. He returned to the store the next day and apologized, but he was eventually written out of the show and left the pawn shop altogether. It is believed by many of the shows fans that Rich was fired because he was becoming a more popular character on the show than the Gold family thus upstaging them.
* Robo, Head of Security (Season 1-Episode 1) In series premiere, he was the long time head of security. However he was sent home for inappropriately kissing an employee. It was thought to be a temporary suspension but he never appeared on the show again.

Initially makes the mistake of overpaying for a couple of Red Wing jerseys but makes up for it by signing them thereby increasing their value.
* Brian, store manager, second in command after the Gold family members after the departure of Rich.

==Reception==

===Comparison to ''Pawn Stars''===
The show has been largely compared to similar reality program ''[[Pawn Stars]]'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], but in the vein of similar programs also on truTV (''[[Operation Repo]]'' and ''[[Lizard Lick Towing]]'' for example), where it differs however is the focus being mainly on the human aspects of drama and interaction, rather than the actual significance of the items being brought into the shop.&lt;ref name="Marechal2013"&gt;{{cite web

|author2=Carole Horst
|date=April 10, 2013
|accessdate=July 7, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to similarities to ''Pawn Stars'', ''Hardcore Pawn'' has been described as simply being a knock-off and a capitalization on the breakout success of ''Pawn Stars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Hibberd |first= James |url= http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/trutv-hardcore-pawn-ratings.html |title= TruTV's 'Pawn Stars' knock-off scores big ratings |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= August 17, 2010 |accessdate= August 24, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100819175924/http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/trutv-hardcore-pawn-ratings.html |archivedate= August 19, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Les Gold defends the show with claims that his show is a true representation of what a pawn shop does, focusing on the human element and showing that people are suffering tough times and need money for basic necessities like food and rent.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Stacey |last= Harrison|date= July 3, 2012 |url= http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2012/07/03/7-questions-with-les-gold-of-trutvs-hardcore-pawn/ |title= 7 Questions With Les Gold of 'Hardcore Pawn |work= Channel Guide Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marc Juris of truTV, any similarities between the shows are coincidental. He also noted that ''Hardcore Pawn'' was in development for more than a year and two test episodes aired in December 2009. Regarding the initial identical time slot of Monday nights at 10 pm ET, opposite ''Pawn Stars'' at the time, Juris claimed the choice was made because ''Hardcore Pawn'' fit well with ''Operation Repo''. The second season debuted in December 2010, in the Tuesday at 9&amp;nbsp;pm ET timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/hardcore-pawn/EP01219217 |title= Hardcore Pawn |work=[[Zap2it]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reality versus scripting===
The first season put an emphasis on the sad stories of people pawning their possessions and on the Golds' need to arm and otherwise protect themselves in dangerous Detroit. But this was too dark for television, and from the second season all mention of danger was dropped and pawn stories downplayed in favor of people selling unusual things and Les bargaining them down in price. Owner Les Gold said at the launch of the show that there would be no staged antics, products or characters on the show.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; However, ''[[New York Post]]'' writer Linda Stasi has opined that some situations in ''Hardcore Pawn'' are set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stasi |first= Linda |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/pawn_spawn_up1AXC7U94xbIrNToKzA9J |title= 'Pawn' spawn: New shop on the block feels the same |work= [[New York Post]] |date= August 16, 2010 |accessdate= August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every episode features moments when Les, who is not normally behind a counter, happens to be there when someone brings in something unusual to sell. The shows are also obviously edited to follow a regular format, with every episode featuring two unruly customers being thrown out, one trip to the parking lot for a car or truck for sale, and usually some argument between Ashley and Seth.

==Series cancellation==
During season 9 truTV decided not to order more episodes because of the network's new direction. truTV was concentrating on comedy programming and it was decided that ''Hardcore Pawn'' did not relate properly to other programs in the network's schedule. No other television networks showed interest in the series, and production was halted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in/item/39702-tv-q-a-once-upon-a-time-hardcore-pawn-and-the-returned |title= TV Q&amp;A |publisher= Community Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoffs==
''Hardcore Pawn'' has generated two spinoffs:

* ''Combat Pawn'', a series about the employees and customers at Guns Plus, a gun shop located near the [[Fort Bragg]] military installation in [[North Carolina]]. Originally developed under the title "''Hardcore Pawn: Fort Bragg''{{-"}}, ''Combat Pawn'' debuted on truTV on Sunday July 15, 2012 at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/PT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=TV News Desk |url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/truTV-to-Premiere-COMBAT-PAWN-715-20120709 |publisher=BWWTVWorld |title=truTV to Premiere 'Combat Pawn', 7/15 |date=July 9, 2012 |accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Hardcore Pawn: Chicago]]'', which features [[Chicago]]'s Royal Pawn Shop, a pawn shop owned by two brothers, Randy and Wayne Cohen, whose family has been in the business for over 100 years.

In addition, Rich Pyle, one of the American Jewelry clerks who was featured in many episodes of ''Hardcore Pawn'', has since left the show and became host of another television series for the [[National Geographic Channel]], ''Meltdown'', a series focusing on the recycling of precious metals. That series debuted on National Geographic on October 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/meltdown/series/meltdown/ |date=August 5, 2013 |title=Meltdown |publisher=[[National Geographic Channel]] |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701153011/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/meltdown/series/meltdown/ |archivedate=July 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human rights literature''' is a literary [[genre]] that deals with [[human rights]] issues, and thus - directly or indirectly - promotes values of [[human rights]]. The goal of human rights literature is to combine the literary driving force with the motivation for action, which is a fundamental and integral element of the struggle for protection of human rights. This literary genre is based on the concept of "Engaged Literature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/343936/litterature-engagee |title=Littérature engagée &amp;#124; French literature &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was articulated by the French writer and philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Human rights literature is committed to society and believes that each one of us has moral duty and power to make a social change. It is based on the belief of the enormous power of literature to make a change, and in the responsibility of the author toward readers both on the social aspect and the artistic one.

==Background==
The concept of human rights literature was first articulated in the foreword to ''Freedom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Greenland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/10/freedom-amnesty-international-short-stories |title=Freedom: Short Stories &amp;#124; Book review &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anthology of short stories by renowned authors from around the world published in Britain in 2010 by Mainstream Publishing in cooperation with the human rights organization [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIUK : Book search and order online : Freedom|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/books_details.asp?BookID=103 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222342/https://www.amnesty.org.uk/books_details.asp?BookID=103 |archivedate=June 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were written in the spirit of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

The foreword - "The Tremendous Power of Literature", by Vered Cohen Barzilay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://novelrights.com/2011/07/13/the-tremendous-power-of-literatureforeword-from-freedom/ |title=The Tremendous Power of Literature/Foreword from "Freedom" |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the relationship between the Italian novella  "Prima di Lasciarsi" by [[Gabriella Ambrosio]] (English: "[[Before We Say Goodbye]]") and human rights.

The foreword along with the book was translated into various languages and published around the world in many countries including UK, US, Canada, Poland, Spain, Latin America, and Italy. At the 2010 Edinburgh Book festival the preliminary concept was first introduced in public discussion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye |title=Before We Say Goodbye - Edinburgh Festival guide &amp;#124; Fest |publisher=Festmag.co.uk |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228111532/https://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye |archivedate=2014-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2012 it was formally introduced by Cohen-Barzilay at [[Oxford University]], UK, at a panel discussion held under the title "The Power of Literature and Human Rights" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talks.ox.ac.uk/talk/index/8103 |title=Oxford Talks : The Power of Literature and Human Rights |publisher=Talks.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early 2013 at the Literary Festival at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/events/2013/literature.aspx |title=The Power of Literature and Human Rights - 2013 - Events - Centre for the Study of Human Rights - Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Cohen-Barzilay founded Novel Rights e-publishing, an e- publishing house specializing in creating and promoting Human Rights Literature.

==Engaged literature and the connection to human rights literature==
"Human rights literature" is based on the idea of "engaged literature" that was first formulated by the French writer and [[philosopher]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his book ''What is literature?''.  Sartre argued that intellectuals and the ordinary citizens must take a stand, especially in regard to major political conflicts. Sartre hoped that literature would serve as a means to enable oppressed minority groups gain recognition and that members of the elites would be moved to action as a result of the influence of literature. He argued that should a novel end with a call for action, it has to consciously address groups that have the power to act.

Sartre offers a double function for literature, acting  as both a mirror for the oppressor and as also as a source of inspiration and guidance for the oppressed, though he does not explicitly explain what the action to be taken is or how to take it within the framework of committed literature. Various actions should be chosen according to their contribution to the realization of a socialist democracy, but the author must not decide according to dogma, in the manner of a conscientious objector.

As a moral concept, human rights literature deals directly or indirectly with human rights and leads its readers to understand and act to protect human rights. The literary products are accompanied by general information concerning human rights and organizations, as well as suggestions for direct action that go hand in hand with subjects that arise from the literature.

==The power of literature vs. the power of art==
Sartre argued that "the reader of the novel submits to the book before him, abandoning his worldly existence to assume a vicarious one while he reads. He lives the problem which he himself helps to create, placing himself in the most sympathetic position white relation to what the writer wishes to say". [[Marina Nemat]], author of "Prisoner of Teheran"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinanemat.com/books.html |title=Marina Nemat |publisher=www.marinanemat.com |date=2007-12-15 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the winner of the first European Parliament 'Human Dignity' award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/88795/toronto-author-marina-nemat-awarded-first-human-dignity-prize-by-european-parliament-presentation-in-milan-italy-on-december-15-2007 |title=SLOPEN LITERARY AGENCY &amp;#124; Toronto author Marina Nemat awarded first "Human Dignity" prize by European Parliament; presentation in Milan, Italy, on December 15, 2007 |publisher=Newswire.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains: "Literature allows the victim to become a survivor and stand up to the past to ensure a better future. It is literature that carries the human experience, reaches our hearts, and makes us feel the pain of those who have been treated unjustly. Without literature and narrative, we would lose our identity as human beings and will dissolve in the darkness of time and our repeated mistakes that lead us from one preventable devastation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/2012/09/06/marina-nemat-authors-note-leila/ |title=Marina Nemat, Author’s Note /"Leila" |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, human rights literature emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately isolated from the world and geopolitical events, and regional or global social crises. Human rights literature does not believe in writing for purely artistic aesthetic purposes. It calls on writers to exercise their moral-social duty wherein the power of the literary creation on the public is enormous and rarely come to fruition. According to the American philosopher professor [[Martha Nussbaum]] in her book: [[Poetic justice|"Poetic Justice"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Justice-Literary-Imagination-Public/dp/0807041092 |title=Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life: Martha C. Nussbaum: 9780807041093: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that social sympathy is a necessary condition for equitable treatment in courts of law. Judges, Nussbaum has observed, are short of imaginative data about the persons they must judge, and novels are one place they can look for guidance. The author [[Richard Rorty]] wrote in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/3RORTY.pdf |format=PDF |title=Human Rights, Rationality and Sentimentality |publisher=Nyu.edu |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty wrote about the "human rights culture" a term he declair to borrow from the Argentinian jurist and philosopher Eduardo Rabossi. In an article called "Human Rights Naturalized", Rabossi argues that philosophers should think of this culture as a new, welcome fact of the post-Holocaust world, They should stop trying to get behind or beneath this fact.

In her essay "The Tremendous Power of Literature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307588838&amp;view=toc |title=Random House Academic |publisher=Randomhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vered Cohen Barzilay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=Novel Rights |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes:  "Literature can be as powerful as life itself. It can be like our [[prophecy]]. It can inspire us to change our world and give us the comfort, hope, passion and strength that we need in order to fight to create a better future for us, as well as all humanity. We just need to keep on reading and to allow the tremendous power of literature to enter our hearts and lead us to our own path." Indeed, Human Rights Literature does not impose on the authors actual call for action, rather, the writer’s task ends as soon as he completes the writing process. Only the readers’ response can answer whether the creation inspires social change or motivates for action.

Human rights literature provides the readers with an opportunity for a direct action, however it is not a compulsory requirement. In fact, the commitment is an unwritten accord between the readers and the literary creation developed through the reading process, which holds simultaneously the freedom to refrain from action.

==Criticism and response==
Critics of engaged literature argue that such literature is propaganda and that it is created and used  for political purposes. But if the literature becomes propaganda the reader would see through that, and the magic, the intimate process of communion between the reader and the author’s inner voice will not unfold.

It is argued that for the purpose of reaching the masses such literature will be reduced to the lowest common denominator while compromising quality standards to a limited criteria of stimulation for action. Sartre stresses that both writers and social leaders must constantly aim for developing and improving their readers’ intellectual level,  offering readers something beyond the familiar and providing an opportunity to expand horizons.

Another criticism of engaged literature suggests irrelevance of the commitment for action during times of large-scale events or conflicts once these circumstances change, and while a great novel is eternal and can exist in timeless literary space. Sartre argued that those who attack engaged literature are manifesting again the old desire to retreat into a private shell and ignore events which may someday reach their lives. Authors, he claimed, are trying in vain to isolate themselves from reality, and during a demanding writing process they are cut off from social problems, and thus, create literature for sheer escapism. All novels, whatever else they may do, inevitably instruct us on life. Engaged novel tells us that we may or may not, relate this knowledge to whatever sphere of reality we choose, whenever and however we wish. We cannot meet reality in our own terms. The novel, which has always presented the reader with knowledge of real life, is changing the form of its presentation in order to accord with a more accurate conception of the relation between the individual and reality.

As [[Gabriella Ambrosio]], author of ''[[Before We Say Goodbye]]'', writes in the foreword of her short story "Sticko": "At times, writers are afraid to know what is inevitable: that “pure” art does not exist. None of us is pure or innocent: any word carrying imaginative power produces culture, and culture produces behaviour." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/sources/ |title=Inspiration Sources &amp;#124; Novel Rights &amp;#124; Human Rights Literature ePublishing |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dilemma which was raised by intellectuals and in literary circles is the issue of the author’s competence to the task if indeed a novel is an adequate tool for generating social action. Can authors understand the substantive social issues? Or handle the risk and complexity as not to support a false cause? Or be discussed only by experts? What has been suggested was that the engaged novel requires greater talent and wider knowledge by novelists than has been necessary before, and in fact create a new generation of engaged authors.

As for irrelevance of human rights issues outside a specific context in time, the answer is embodied in the relevance and validity of human rights’ values which were articulated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. These principles transcend the era in which they were articulated and bring a set of burning social issues to the surface.
An example of a novel set in a temporal and geographical context which transcended these limits is [[Harper Lee]]’s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. While the book’s focus on racism in the United States covered events in the author’s environment at a specific time, it highlighted the larger issue of racism and discrimination in a universal manner, transcending the local context of the story. With its social commitment for change, the book had an enormous impact, not only on local issue of racism, but rather as an influencing generations of readers around the world.

==Literature and the human rights movement==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2018}}Unlike the abstract commitment to social action of Sartre’s engaged literature, human rights literature places human rights at the core of its moral and social duty.  It emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately cut off from the world, geopolitical changes or social crises. Human rights literature does not believe writing is solely an artistic aesthetic exercise, and calls on writers to realize the social commitment under the power of their literary creation that it effects on the public is enormous and does not come to fruition often. And thus, human rights literature manifests that unique and close links exist between literature and human rights campaigns.

Lynn Hunt identified these links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2002/april17/hunt-417.html |title=Empathy with literary characters helped spur concept of human rights, scholar says: 04/02 |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=2002-04-17 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Inventing Human Rights: A History'', she examines the emergence of the prose narrative in the 18th century and the role it played in the conception of the human rights idea. Hunt demonstrates how ideas of human relationships portrayed in novels and art generated a powerful fictional empathy which helped spreading this new idea.  ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by [[Nelle Harper Lee]] is one example of a novel that had major contribution and impact on American public opinion on the issue of race and rights. Another example is [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]’s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was the best-selling novel of the 19th century. The book had a deep impact on public opinion in the US on the issue of slavery and is seen as one of the triggers to the Abolitionist movement in the 1850s.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}
Many other books and novels had great impact on human rights issues and struggles,{{According to whom|date=January 2018}} for example: [[Toni Morrison]]’s ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', [[Giannina Braschi]]’s ''[[United States of Banana]]'', [[Franz Kafka]]’s ''[[The Trial]]'' and ''Night'' by [[Elie Wiesel]].

==Freedom of expression and persecution of authors==
While the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and subsequent international covenants defined Freedom of Thought and Expression as fundamental human rights, constant and frequent attacks on these freedoms takes place under dictatorships and repressive regimes in attempt to silence any protest or dissent. Censorship is exercised on each and every publication while are often writers and journalists are persecuted, imprisoned and executed. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] is a Chinese literary critic, writer, professor, and human rights activist. He published a manifesto calling for freedom of expression and free elections, and in 2009 was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power”. Like Xiaobo, many authors suffer persecution as authorities recognize their unique power and ability to impact on the masses. [[Salman Rushdie]], an awarded British-Muslim novelist and essayist of Indian origin became a target following the publication his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988). The book was the center of a major controversy in the Islamic world because of what was perceived as an irreverent depiction of [[Muhammad]].  Death threats were made against him, including a [[fatwā]] issued by [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], the Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989 and a bounty was offered for Rushdie's death. Rushdi was forced to hide and live under police protection for many years.  Years later Rushdi became the president of [[PEN International]], the worldwide association of writers who fights for freedom of expression, and acts as a powerful voice on behalf of writers harassed, imprisoned and sometimes killed for their views.

The '''IS–LM model''', or '''Hicks–Hansen model''', is a [[macroeconomic]] tool that shows the relationship between [[interest rates]] ([[ordinate]]) and assets market (also known as real output in goods and services market plus money market, as [[abscissa]]). The intersection of the "[[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]]–[[saving]]" (IS) and "[[liquidity preference]]–[[money supply]]" (LM) curves models "general equilibrium" where supposed simultaneous equilibrium occurs in both interest and assets markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert J. Gordon |first=Robert J. |last=Gordon |title=Macroeconomics |edition=Eleventh |year=2009 |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Addison Wesley |isbn=9780321552075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet two equivalent interpretations are possible: first, the IS–LM model explains changes in [[national income]] when price level is fixed short-run; second, the IS–LM model shows why an [[aggregate demand curve]] can shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=N. Gregory Mankiw |first=N. Gregory |last=Mankiw |title=Macroeconomics |edition=Eighth |year=2012 |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=9781429240024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse economic fluctuations but also to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=John Soman |authorlink2=Alison Wride |first1=John |last1=Sloman |first2=Alison |last2=Wride |title=Economics |edition=Seventh |year=2009 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=9780273715627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was developed by [[John Hicks]] in 1937,&lt;ref name="Hicks1937" /&gt; and later extended by [[Alvin Hansen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=A. H. |year=1953 |title=A Guide to Keynes |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mathematical representation of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macroeconomic theory]].

==History==
The IS–LM model was first introduced at a conference of the [[Econometric Society]] held in Oxford during September 1936. [[Roy Harrod]], [[John Hicks|John R. Hicks]], and [[James Meade]] all presented papers
describing [[mathematical model]]s attempting to summarize [[John Maynard Keynes]]' ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]''.&lt;ref name="Hicks1937" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meade |first=J. E. |title=A Simplified Model of Mr. Keynes' System |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=98–107 |year=1937 |jstor=2967607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks, who had seen a draft of Harrod's paper, invented the IS–LM model (originally using the [[abbreviation]] "LL", not "LM"). He later presented it in
"Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation".&lt;ref name="Hicks1937"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=J. R. |year=1937 |title=Mr. Keynes and the ‘Classics’: A Suggested Interpretation |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=147–159 |jstor= |doi=10.2307/1907242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks later agreed that the model missed important points of Keynesian theory, criticizing it as having very limited use beyond "a classroom gadget", and criticizing equilibrium methods generally: "When one turns to questions of policy, looking towards the future instead of the past, the use of equilibrium methods is still more suspect."&lt;ref name=h1980&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=John |title=‘IS-LM’: An Explanation |journal=Journal of Post Keynesian Economics |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=1981 |pages=139–154 |jstor=4537583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first problem was that it presents the real and monetary sectors as separate, something Keynes attempted to transcend. In addition, an equilibrium model ignores uncertainty—and that [[liquidity preference]] only makes sense in the presence of uncertainty "For there is no sense in liquidity, unless expectations are uncertain."&lt;ref name=h1980/&gt; A shift in one of the IS or LM curves will cause a change in expectations, which shifts the other curve.

Although generally accepted as being imperfect, the model is seen as a useful pedagogical tool for imparting an understanding of the questions that macroeconomists today attempt to answer through more nuanced approaches. As such, it is included in most undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks, but omitted from most graduate texts due to the current dominance of [[real business cycle]] and [[new Keynesian]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Formation==
The model is presented as a graph of two intersecting lines in the first quadrant.

The horizontal axis represents [[national income]] or [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] [[gross domestic product]] and is labelled ''Y.'' The vertical axis represents the [[real interest rate]], ''r.'' Since this is a non-dynamic model, there is a fixed relationship between the [[nominal interest rate]] and the real interest rate (the former equals the latter plus the expected inflation rate which is [[exogeny|exogenous]] in the short run); therefore variables such as [[money demand]] which actually depend on the nominal interest rate can equivalently be expressed as depending on the real interest rate.

The point where these schedules intersect represents a short-run [[General equilibrium|equilibrium]] in the real and monetary sectors (though not necessarily in other sectors, such as labor markets): both the product market and the money market are in equilibrium. This equilibrium yields a unique combination of the interest rate and [[real GDP]].

===IS curve===
For the investment-saving curve, the independent variable is the interest rate and the dependent variable is the level of income.  (Note that scientific graphs typically place the independent variable—interest rate, in this example—on the vertical axis while the dependent variable is measured with the horizontal axis.)&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/supply-and-demand-and-qwerty/ Supply and Demand and QWERTY]. February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The IS curve is drawn as downward-[[slope|sloping]] with the interest rate (i) on the vertical axis and GDP (gross domestic product: Y) on the horizontal axis. The initials IS stand for "Investment and Saving equilibrium" but since 1937 have been used to represent the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all equilibria where total spending (consumer spending + planned private investment + government purchases + net exports) equals an economy's total output (equivalent to real income, Y, or GDP). To keep the link with the historical meaning, the IS curve can be said to represent the equilibria where total private investment equals total saving, where the latter equals consumer saving ''plus'' government saving (the budget surplus) ''plus'' foreign saving (the trade surplus). In equilibrium, all spending is desired or planned; there is no unplanned inventory accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Gonçalo L. | last = Fonseca | url = http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/essays/classic/glut.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030726214851/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/essays/classic/glut.htm | archivedate = 2003-07-26 | title = The General Glut Controversy | publisher = [[The New School]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of real GDP (Y) is determined along this line for each [[interest rate]].

Thus the IS curve is a [[locus of points]] of equilibrium in the "real" (non-financial) economy. Each point on the curve represents the equilibrium between the Savings and Investment (S=I).

Given expectations about returns on fixed investment, every level of the real interest rate (i) will generate a certain level of planned fixed [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] and other interest-sensitive spending: lower interest rates encourage higher fixed investment and the like. Income is at the equilibrium level for a given interest rate when the saving that [[consumer]]s and other economic participants choose to do out of this income equals investment (or, equivalently, when "leakages" from the [[circular flow]] equal "injections").  The [[multiplier effect]] of an increase in fixed investment resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the IS curve. In summary, this line represents the causation from falling interest rates to rising planned fixed investment (etc.) to rising national income and output.

The IS curve is defined by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;Y = C \left({Y}-{T(Y)}\right) + I \left({r}\right) + G + NX(Y),&lt;/math&gt;
where Y represents income, &lt;math&gt;C(Y-T(Y))&lt;/math&gt; represents consumer spending as an increasing function of disposable income (income, Y, minus taxes, T(Y), which themselves depend positively on income), &lt;math&gt;I(r)&lt;/math&gt; represents investment as a decreasing function of the real interest rate, G represents government spending, and NX(Y) represents net exports (exports minus imports) as a decreasing function of income (decreasing because imports are an increasing function of income).

In this model, the level of C (consumption), G (government spending), EX (exports), IM (imports), and R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (real interest rate) are considered to be [[exogenous]], meaning that they are taken as a given, because they are determined by factors outside of this model. Their equations are as follows: C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , G&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; Ỹ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , EX&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , and IM&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. I (investment) is [[Endogenous (economics)|endogenous]], meaning that it is explained by our model, and has the equation I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = (ā&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) − b (R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; − ṝ) Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , where ṝ is the marginal product of capital, R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the real interest rate, ā&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the share of potential output that goes toward investment, and b is a constant. A few equations are necessary in order to derive the IS curve: ā = ā&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + ā&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + ā&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + ā&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; - ā&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt; - 1, and Ỹ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = (Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = (Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) - (Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) = (Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) - 1.

===LM curve===

[[File:Money Market diagram.svg|thumb|270px|The money market equilibrium diagram.]]

For the liquidity preference and money supply curve, the independent variable is "income" and the dependent variable is "the interest rate."  The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which the money market is in equilibrium.  It is an upward-sloping curve representing the role of finance and money.

The LM function is the set of equilibrium points between the [[liquidity preference]] (or demand for money) function and the [[money supply]] function (as determined by [[bank]]s and [[central bank]]s).

Each point on the LM curve reflects a particular equilibrium situation in the money market equilibrium diagram, based on a particular level of income. In the money market equilibrium diagram, the liquidity preference function is simply the willingness to hold cash balances instead of [[Security (finance)|securities]]. For this function, the nominal interest rate (on the vertical axis) is plotted against the quantity of cash balances (or liquidity), on the horizontal. The liquidity preference function is downward sloping. Two basic elements determine the quantity of cash balances demanded (liquidity preference) and therefore the position and slope of the function:
* 1) [[Transactions demand]] for money: this includes both (a) the willingness to hold cash for everyday transactions and (b) a precautionary measure (money demand in case of emergencies). Transactions demand is positively related to real GDP (represented by Y, and also referred to as income). This is simply explained – as GDP increases, so does spending and therefore transactions. As GDP is considered exogenous to the liquidity preference function, changes in GDP shift the curve. For example, an increase in GDP will increase transactions which will increase the demand for money for given interest rates, and cause the Liquidity preference curve to shift to the right.
* 2) [[Speculative demand]] for money: this is the willingness to hold cash instead of securities as an asset for investment purposes. Speculative demand is inversely related to the interest rate. As the interest rate rises, the [[opportunity cost]] of investing in securities increases, because the increased interest rate payments on savings are lost. In addition, as interest rates rise, the required rate of return for investors to make a profit on speculative investments rises, decreasing demand for these investments. So, as interest rates rise, speculative demand falls. 

The money supply function for this situation is plotted on the same graph as the liquidity preference function. The money supply is determined by the central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money. Though the money supply is related indirectly to interest rates in the very short run, the money supply in effect is perfectly [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] with respect to nominal interest rates (assuming the central bank chooses to control the money supply rather than focusing directly on the interest rate). Thus the money supply function is represented as a vertical line – money supply is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the LM curve is defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;M/P=L(i,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, where the supply of money is represented as the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] amount M/P (as opposed to the nominal amount M), with P representing the [[price level]], and L being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate i and the level Y of real income. The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which money supply equals money demand—that is, for which the money market is in equilibrium.

For a given level of income, the intersection point between the liquidity preference and money supply functions implies a single point on the LM curve: specifically, the point giving the level of the interest rate which equilibrate the money market at the given level of income. Recalling that for the LM curve, the interest rate is plotted against real GDP (whereas the liquidity preference and money supply functions plot interest rates against the quantity of cash balances), an increase in GDP shifts the liquidity preference function rightward and hence increases the interest rate. Thus the LM function is positively sloped.

==Shifts==
One hypothesis is that a government's [[deficit spending]] ("[[fiscal policy]]") has an effect similar to that of a lower saving rate or increased private fixed investment, increasing the amount of demand for goods at each individual interest rate. An increased deficit by the national government shifts the IS curve to the right.  This raises the equilibrium interest rate (from i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and national income (from Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as shown in the graph above.  The equilibrium level of national income in the IS-LM diagram is referred to as [[aggregate demand]].

Keynesians argue spending may actually "crowd in" (encourage) private fixed investment via the [[accelerator effect]], which helps long-term growth. Further, if government deficits are spent on productive public investment (e.g., infrastructure or public health) that spending directly and eventually raises potential output, although not necessarily more (or less) than the lost private investment might have. The extent of any crowding out depends on the shape of the LM curve.  A shift in the IS curve along a relatively flat LM curve can increase output substantially with little change in the interest rate. On the other hand, an rightward shift in the IS curve along a vertical LM curve will lead to higher interest rates, but no change in output (this case represents the "[[treasury view]]").

Rightward shifts of the IS curve also result from [[exogeny|exogenous]] increases in investment spending (i.e., for reasons other than interest rates or income), in consumer spending, and in export spending by people outside the economy being modelled, as well as by exogenous decreases in spending on imports.  Thus these too raise both equilibrium income and the equilibrium interest rate.  Of course, changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the IS curve in the opposite direction.

The IS–LM model also allows for the role of [[monetary policy]]. If the money supply is increased, that shifts the LM curve downward or to the right, lowering interest rates and raising equilibrium national income.  Further, exogenous decreases in liquidity preference, perhaps due to improved transactions technologies, lead to downward shifts of the LM curve and thus increases in income and decreases in interest rates. Changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the LM curve in the opposite direction.

==Incorporation into larger models==
By itself, the IS–LM model is used to study the short run when [[price level|prices]] are fixed or sticky and no [[inflation]] is taken into consideration. But in practice the main role of the model is as a sub-model of larger models (especially the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model – the [[AD–AS model]]) which allow for a flexible [[price level]]. In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, each point on the aggregate demand curve is an outcome of the IS–LM model for aggregate demand Y based on a particular price level.  Starting from one point on the aggregate demand curve, at a particular price level and a quantity of aggregate demand implied by the IS–LM model for that price level, if one considers a higher potential price level, in the IS–LM model the real money supply M/P will be lower and hence the LM curve will be shifted higher, leading to lower aggregate demand; hence at the higher price level the level of aggregate demand is lower, so the aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped.

In [[psychoanalytic theory]], when an individual is unable to integrate difficult feelings, specific defenses are mobilized to overcome what the individual perceives as an unbearable situation. The defense that helps in this process is called [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]]. Splitting is the tendency to view events or people as either all bad or all good.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kraft Goin (1998). [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p981153.html ''Borderline Personality Disorder: Splitting Countertransference.''] The Psychiatric Times, vol. 15 issue 11&lt;/ref&gt; When viewing people as all good, the individual is said to be using the [[defense mechanism]] '''idealization''': a mental mechanism in which the person attributes [[exaggeratedly]] positive qualities to the self or others. When viewing people as all bad, the individual employs '''devaluation''': attributing exaggeratedly negative qualities to the self or others.

In child development, idealization and devaluation are quite normal. During the childhood development stage, individuals become capable of perceiving others as complex structures, containing both good and bad components. If the development stage is interrupted (by early childhood trauma, for example), these defense mechanisms may persist into adulthood.

== Sigmund Freud ==
The term idealization first appeared in connection with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s definition of [[narcissism]]. Freud's vision was that all human infants pass through a phase of [[primary narcissism]] in which they assume they are the centre of their universe.  To obtain the parents' love the child comes to do what he thinks the parents value. Internalising these values the child forms an [[ego ideal]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, E.D. (1978). ''The Ego Ideal of the Psychoanalyst.'' Int. J. Psycho-Anal., 59:377-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C.S. &amp; Scheier, M.F. (2000). ''Perspectives on Personality.'' Needham Heights: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; This ego ideal contains rules for good behaviour and standards of excellence toward which the ego has to strive. When the child cannot bear ambivalence between the [[real self]] and the ego ideal and defenses are used too often, it is called pathologic. Freud called this situation [[secondary narcissism]], because the ego itself is idealized. Explanations of the idealization of others besides the self are sought in drive theory as well as in object-relation theory. From the viewpoint of libidinal drives, idealization of other people is a "flowing-over" of narcissistic [[libido]] onto the object; from the viewpoint of self-object relations, the object representations (like that of the caregivers) were made more beautiful than they really were.&lt;ref&gt;Spruiell, V. (1979). Freud's Concepts of Idealization. J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn., 27:777-791&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heinz Kohut ==
An extension of Freud's theory of narcissism came when [[Heinz Kohut]] presented the so-called "self-object transferences" of idealization and [[Mirroring (psychology)|mirroring]]. To Kohut, idealization in childhood is a healthy mechanism. If the parents fail to provide appropriate opportunities for idealization ([[healthy narcissism]]) and mirroring (how to cope with reality), the child does not develop beyond a developmental stage in which he sees himself as [[grandiose]] but in which he also remains dependent on others to provide his [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, L. (1989). [http://www.findingstone.com/professionals/monographs/kohutandjung.htm ''Kohut and Jung A Comparison of Theory and Therapy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newirth, J.W. (1987). ''Idealization and Interpretation.'' Contemporary Psychoanalysis 23, 239-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut stated that, with narcissistic patients, idealization of the self and the therapist should be allowed during therapy and then very gradually will diminish as a result of unavoidable optimal frustration.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, S.A., &amp; Black, M.J. (1995). ''Freud and beyond.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otto Kernberg ==
[[Otto Kernberg]] has provided an extensive discussion of idealization, both in its defensive and adaptive aspects. He conceptualised idealization as involving a denial of unwanted characteristics of an object, then enhancing the object by projecting one's own libido or omnipotence on it. He proposed a developmental line with one end of the continuum being a normal form of idealization and the other end a pathological form. In the latter, the individual has a problem with object constancy and sees others as all good or all bad, thus bolstering idealization and devaluation. At this stage idealization is associated with borderline pathology. At the other end of the continuum, idealization is said to be a necessary precursor for feelings of mature love.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, P.M., Van-Der Keshet, Y. (1995). ''A Note on the Assessment of Idealization.'' Journal of Personality Assessment, 65 (1) 77-90

In engineering, '''iso-elastic''' refers to a system of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and [[tension (mechanics)|tensile]] parts (springs and pulleys) which are arranged in a configuration which serves to isolate physical motion at one end from affecting the same motion at the other end.
This type of device must be able to maintain angular direction and load-bearing over a large range of motion.

The most prominent use of an iso-elastic system is in the supporting armature of a [[Steadicam]].
The Steadicam arm is used to isolate a film or video camera from the operator's movements. 
Steadicam arms all work in a fashion similar to a [[Luxo L1|spring lamp]] since each arm has 2 sections (similar to and labelled like a human arm), both the upper and fore-arm sections consist of a [[parallelogram]] with diagonal iso-elastic cable-pulley-spring system. The iso-elastic system is tensioned to counteract the weight of the camera and [[steadicam]] sled. This tensioning allows the camera and operator to move vertically and independently of each other. For example, as the operator runs, the bouncing of his body is absorbed by the springs, keeping the camera steady. The arm also has unsprung [[hinge]]s at both ends of each arm allowing it to bend in the horizontal plane (just like your elbow, not like a spring lamp).

To understand how an iso-elastic system works, we must first understand how springs work.  The [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (elastic force) in a spring is proportional to its extension according to [[Hooke's law]].  This means that if a weight is hung on a spring it will oscillate with [[simple harmonic motion]].  This is because when the weight is above the balance point, the spring's tension is reduced so the weight falls due to gravity, and when the weight is below the balance point the spring's tension will pull it back upwards.

If a simple spring system were used in a steadicam, then if the operator moved vertically, the camera would execute simple harmonic motion, and bounce up and down.  Instead, an iso-elastic system is employed.

The springs used are large, stiff springs with a high [[modulus of elasticity]], and they are highly tensioned.  A [[pulley|compound pulley]] system is then used so that the large force exerted by the spring can be divided by a factor of (say) five. The cable exiting the pulley system will have a moderate tension on it, but most importantly, when the cable is drawn in or out, and the extension of the spring changes by only a fifth of that distance, so that the tension force of the spring will not change much.  The result is that the spring-pulley system can produce a fairly constant tension in the cable over a large range of movement.

The almost constant force exerted by an iso-elastic system is employed in the armature of a steadicam, to counteract the constant force of [[gravity]] on the camera's and mount's [[mass]].  The result is that the [[weight]] of the camera is almost exactly balanced by the tension force throughout the entire range of vertical movement, so even when the operator jumps vertically, the camera will retain its vertical position due to [[inertia]], but remain balanced, just with the armature at a different angle.

As a result, the camera doesn't bounce up to the 'balanced' position after a move, for example when the operator steps up onto a curb from the road. This allows the camera to be more isolated and independent of the operator's moves. The operator can of course deliberately move the camera up or down, if desired. In reality however camera operators find it preferable for the arm to not be perfectly iso-elastic so that the camera will naturally rise to a comfortable operating height. Though the springs will be tensioned so this only happens very slowly and without bouncing up and down so as to maintain the smoothness of the camera's motion."&lt;ref name="Adustable, iso-elastic support apparatus

Currently, she focuses on the study of [[global microstructures]] and [[Social studies of finance]]. Knorr Cetina is the
Otto Borchert Distinguished Service Professor (Jointly Appointed in Anthropology) and Chair of the Department of Sociology at the [[University of Chicago]].

A ''knowledge object'' is a theoretical concept introduced by Knorr Cetina to describe the emergence of post-social relations in [[epistemic cultures]]. Knowledge objects are different from everyday things and are defined as unfolding structures that are non-identical with themselves; [[Jyri Engeström]] based the concept of [[social objects]] on this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Knorr-Cetina studied at the [[University of Vienna]], receiving a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology (with a minor in sociology) in 1971. Her dissertation research focused on the structural analysis of oral literature. She shifted her focus toward sociology as she found that cultural anthropology at the time was too focused on historical concerns, while she was more interested in contemporary social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvhVALUQbG4C|title=Taking the Naturalistic Turn, Or How Real Philosophy of Science Is Done|last=Bechtel|first=William|last2=Callebaut|first2=Werner|date=1993-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226091860|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of her doctorate, Knorr-Cetina went to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, where many influential sociologists were invited to give presentations. This resulted in a Post-doctoral diploma in sociology, and an appointment as an instructor in anthropology at the University of Vienna from 1972–73, and then in sociology from 1973-76. During this time, Knorr-Cetina engaged in her first empirical investigations of science leading the 1975 publication (with Hermann Strasser and Hans Georg Zilian) ''Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfi_iPJPKnkC|title=Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development|last=Knorr|first=K. D.|last2=Strasser|first2=H.|last3=Zilian|first3=H. G.|date=1975-12-31|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9789027706003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during these years that she first encountered the work of the ethnomethodologically-inclined sociologist [[Aaron Cicourel]], specifically "Method and measurement in sociology."

From 1976-77, Knorr-Cetina received a [[Ford Foundation]] Fellowship to study at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Shortly before her arrival in California, the French philosopher-turned-sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] and British sociologist [[Steve Woolgar|Steven Woolgar]] began their well known "laboratory studies" at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] in southern California. Korr-Cetina's work at Berkeley ultimately contributed to this network of laboratory studies in the late 1970s, which would eventually become the field of the [[Social Studies of Science and Technology]]. The empirical research conducted while at Berkeley also became her widely-cited 1981 publication ''The Manufacture of Knowledge: An Essay on the Constructivist and Contextual Nature of Science''. Knorr-Cetina also received her Habilitation in sociology at the [[University of Bielefeld]] in 1981, and served as Professor of Sociology at Bielefeld from 1983 to 2001. Her work in the social studies of science during these years culminated in her widely-cited book ''Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge,'' published in 1999.

Knorr-Cetina's progression to understanding how technology mediates sociality led her to select global financial markets as a new "laboratory" to study knowledge in society. The first suggestion of this new field site was in the article "Sociality with objects: Social relations in postsocial knowledge societies" (1997), followed later by a conference on "The Status of the Object in Social Science" at Brunel University in September 1999. The paper she presented at this conference, entitled "The Market as an Object of Attachment: Exploring Postsocial Relations in Financial Markets", was later published in 2000. Her co-author was Urs Bruegger, a former foreign exchange dealer. The two collaborated on over a dozen articles on global financial markets.

==Sociology of Global Financial Systems==
With the turn of the century, Knorr Cetina became interested in global financial markets as an object of study. From early work with Urs Bruegger,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3341821?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents][http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011392102050003006] we see this developing into a strong research interest.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1600910X.2003.9672857][https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Xv1pgZA4xH8C&amp;dq=knorr+cetina+financial&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] This work is enhanced by the application of tools from science studies and the sociology of knowledge, for example, imagining "the market" as an object of attachment for traders or using market infrastructure (e.g. Bloomberg terminals) to see the microconstruction of the global market in the space of the local. The financial market infrastructure also comprises a "global scopic system" that integrates news and information across the world.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1600910X.2003.9672857]

==The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World==
Knorr Cetina’s lecture “The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World” from 2008 is vital in rethinking past assumptions about communication and interaction order previously published by sociologists, namely [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Knorr Cetina, Karin. "[http://ereserves.bowdoin.edu/f12/soc214/knorr_synthetic_soc214.pdf The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World]." Lecture. Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. Boston. 1 Aug. 2008. CBBcat.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lecture, which was eventually published in 2009, Knorr Cetina introduces and explains new concepts regarding global interaction. Although Goffman is widely published and read in these areas, much has changed since his day and Knorr Cetina conceptualized such changes.

The introduction of the “synthetic situation” is arguably one of her most important new concepts. It is defined as a situation that “…invariably includes, and may in fact be entirely constituted by, on-screen projections…”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A synthetic situation, therefore, can manifest in many ways, both informal and formal. Examples include an online video chat, playing [[video games]] against others on the Internet or even a business deal done via [[Videoconferencing|videoconference]]. This idea can be seen as a result of the advancement in technology in recent years, and adds a new dimension to Goffman’s social situation where [[face-to-face interaction]] is required. Knorr Cetina explains the difference of the two situations by the use of surgery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A Goffmanian situation occurs when there is just the surgeon and the patient. A synthetic situation arises, however, when the surgeon uses technology like a scope and a screen in order to accomplish the task at hand. Without looking at the patient through the screen, the job would not be able to be done and would remain a face-to-face, social situation.

'''Looting''', also referred to as  '''sacking''', '''ransacking''', '''plundering''', '''despoiling''', '''despoliation''', and '''pillaging''', is the indiscriminate taking of goods by force as part of a military or political victory, or during a catastrophe, such as [[war]],&lt;ref name="BBC_Baghdad_protests"&gt;{{cite news | title = Baghdad protests over looting | work = BBC News | publisher = BBC | date = 2003-04-12 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2941733.stm | accessdate = 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[natural disaster]] (where law and civil enforcement are temporarily ineffective),&lt;ref name="BBC_Americas_looting"&gt;{{cite news | title = World: Americas Looting frenzy in quake city |publisher = BBC News| date = 1999-01-28 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/262848.stm | accessdate = 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[rioting]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Argentine"&gt;{{cite news | title = Argentine president resigns |publisher = BBC News| date = 2001-12-21 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1722584.stm | accessdate = 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in a broader sense to describe egregious instances of [[theft]] and [[embezzlement]], such as the "plundering" of private or public assets by governments.&lt;ref name="loot_def_dict"&gt;{{cite web | title = Definition of the word loot | work = Dictionary.com | publisher = Dictionary.com, LLC | year = 2010 | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/loot | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The proceeds of all these activities can be described as '''booty''', '''loot''',  '''plunder''', '''spoils''', or '''pillage'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/looting?s=t|title=the definition of looting|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/booty|title=Booty - Define Booty at Dictionary.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[armed conflict]], pillage is prohibited by [[international law]], and constitutes a [[war crime]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"&gt;[https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule52 Rule 52. Pillage is prohibited.], ''Customary IHL Database'', [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC)/[[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting by type==

===In armed conflict===
[[File:Spaanse Furie - De plundering van Mechelen door de hertog van Alba in 1572 (Frans Hogenberg).jpg|thumb|The sacking and looting of [[Mechelen]] by the Spanish troops led by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], 2 October 1572]]

Looting by a victorious army during war has been common practice throughout recorded history. For foot soldiers, it was viewed as a way to supplement their often meagre income&lt;ref name=hsc&gt;Hsi-sheng Chi, ''Warlord politics in China, 1916–1928'', Stanford University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-8047-0894-0}}, str. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the celebration of victory. On higher levels, the proud exhibition of loot was an integral part of the typical [[Roman triumph]], and [[Genghis Khan]] was not unusual in proclaiming that the greatest happiness was "to vanquish your enemies ... to rob them of their wealth".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hoyle Howorth [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4PErdXlLhwC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century: Part 1 the Mongols Proper and the Kalmyks''], Cosimo Inc. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare in ancient times, the spoils of war included the defeated populations, which were often [[enslavement|enslaved]]. The women and children were often absorbed into the victorious country's population.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Thorton, ''African Background in American Colonization'', in ''The Cambridge economic history of the United States'', Stanley L. Engerman, Robert E. Gallman (ed.), Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-39442-2}}, p. 87. "African states waged war to acquire slaves [...] raids that appear to have been more concerned with obtaining loot (including slaves) than other objectives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Bagot Glubb, ''The Empire of the Arabs'', Hodder and Stoughton, 1963, p.283. "...thousand Christian captives formed part of the loot and were subsequently sold as slaves in the markets of Syria".&lt;/ref&gt; In other pre-modern societies, objects made of precious metals were the preferred target of war looting, largely because of their easy portability. In many cases looting was an opportunity to obtain treasures that otherwise would not have been obtainable. Since the 18th century, [[looted art|works of art]] have increasingly become a popular target. In the 1930s and even more so during [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] engaged in large scale and organized [[Nazi plunder|looting of art and property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. R. Kudelski, ''Tajemnice nazistowskiej grabieży polskich zbiorów sztuki'', Warszawa 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2291481.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nazi loot claim 'compelling' | date=October 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looting, combined with poor [[military discipline]], has occasionally been an army's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In other cases, for example the [[Wahhabi sack of Karbala]], loot has financed further victories.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne H. Bowen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S6J2Q3TlJpMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z7xkfvrX_x&amp;sig=yg1NCeie86areM74Tp0N2ROwUf8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f4cCTbnlLsL38AaO_dTrAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''The History of Saudi Arabia''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. 73. {{ISBN|0-313-34012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all looters in wartime are conquerors; the looting of [[Vistula Land]] by its retreating defenders in 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Andrzej Garlicki, ''Z dziejów Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej'', Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, 1986, {{ISBN|83-02-02245-4}}, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; was among the factors sapping the loyalty of [[Poland in World War I]]. Local civilians can also take advantage of a breakdown of order to loot public and private property, such as took place at the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in the course of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;STEVEN LEE MYERS, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/middleeast/24museum.html Iraq Museum Reopens Six Years After Looting], New York Times, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' describes widespread looting by [[Moscow]]'s citizens before [[Napoleon]]'s troops enter the city, and by [[Grande Armée|French troops]] elsewhere.

====Prohibited under international law====
In [[armed conflict]], pillage is prohibited by both [[customary international law]] and by [[treaty]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; The prohibition against pillage was recognized in the [[Lieber Code]], Brussels Declaration (1874), and Oxford Manual.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] ([[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|modified in 1954]]) obliges military forces not only to avoid destruction of enemy property, but to provide protection to it.&lt;ref name=hague&gt;Barbara T. Hoffman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvXTcGC5CwQC&amp;pg=PA57 ''Art and Cultural Heritage: Law, Policy, and Practice''], Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 57. {{ISBN|0-521-85764-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8 of the [[Statute of the International Criminal Court]] provides that in international warfare, the "pillaging a town or place, even when taken by assault," is a [[war crime]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; In the aftermath of [[World War II]], a number of war criminals were prosecuted for pillage. Several people have been prosecuted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] for pillage.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;

The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] of 1949 explicitly prohibits the looting of civilian property during wartime.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gen&gt;E. Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood, Marc Weller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xVSkGtcT5YC&amp;pg=PA154 ''The Kuwait Crisis: Basic Documents''], Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 154. {{ISBN|0-521-46308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Theoretically, to prevent such looting, unclaimed property is moved to the custody of the [[Custodian of Enemy Property]], to be handled until being returned to its owner.

===Archaeological removals===
{{further information|Grave robbery}}
The term "looting" is also sometimes used to refer to [[antiquities]] being removed from countries by unauthorized people, either domestic people breaking the law seeking monetary gain, or by foreign nations, which are usually more interested in prestige or previously, "scientific discovery". An example of this might be the removal of the contents of Egyptian tombs which were transported to museums in Europe.&lt;ref name="pyramid"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061024-hawass.html
|publisher=National Geographic News

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples include the obelisks of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]], in the (Oriental Museum, [[University of Durham]], United Kingdom), Pharaoh [[Ptolemy IX]], ([[Philae]] Obelisk, in Wimborne, Dorset, United Kingdom). Whether this constitutes "looting" is a debated point, with other parties pointing out that the Europeans were usually given permission of some sort, and that many of the treasures wouldn't have been discovered at all if the Europeans hadn't funded and organized the expeditions or digs that located them. Many of these antiquities have already been returned to their country of origin voluntarily.

===Looting of industry===
In the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Soviet forces systematically plundered the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of Germany, including the [[Recovered Territories]] which were to be transferred to Poland. They sent valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and whole factories to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321165047/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html |title=MIĘDZY MODERNIZACJĄ A MARNOTRAWSTWEM |archivedate=2005-03-21 |publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]] |language=Polish }} See also [http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm other copy online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426011453/http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm |date=2007-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/4/biuletyn4_51.html|title=ARMIA CZERWONA NA DOLNYM ŚLĄSKU|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321233124/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/4/biuletyn4_51.html|archivedate=2005-03-21|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures against looting following disasters==
[[File:053 French Foreign Legion.JPG|thumb|[[Military of Côte d'Ivoire|FAFN]] soldier caught by French Foreign Legion troops.]]

During a disaster, police and military are sometimes unable to prevent looting when they are overwhelmed by humanitarian or combat concerns, or cannot be summoned due to damaged communications infrastructure. Especially during natural disasters, some people find themselves forced to take what is not theirs in order to survive. How to respond to this, and where the line between unnecessary "looting" and necessary "scavenging" lies, is often a dilemma for governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/136582.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Indonesian food minister tolerates looting | date=July 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, looting may be tolerated or even encouraged by governments for political or other reasons.

'''Mayhem''' is a [[common law]] [[criminal offense]] consisting of the intentional [[maiming]] of another person.

Under the law of [[England and Wales]] and other common law jurisdictions, it originally consisted of the intentional and wanton removal of a body part that would handicap a person's ability to defend themself in [[combat]]. Under the strict common law definition, initially this required damage to an eye or a limb, while cutting off an ear or a nose was deemed not sufficiently disabling. Later the meaning of the crime expanded to encompass any mutilation, disfigurement, or crippling act done using any instrument.

==In England==

===History of definitions===
{{update|type=section|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- See talk page, section "Abolition in England and Wales" --&gt;
In England and Wales, it has fallen into disuse. In 1992 [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|the Law Commission]] recommended that it be abolished,&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission, Consultation Paper No.122, Offences Against the Person and General Principles, Appendix A, Draft Criminal Law Bill, clause 31(1)(a)(iii) at page 90 of the report [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1992/c122.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1998 the [[Home Office]] proposed to abolish it, in the course of codifying the law relating to [[offences against the person]].&lt;ref&gt;The Home Office. 1998. Violence: Reforming the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. {{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-1998-violence-reforming-law/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227012915/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-1998-violence-reforming-law/ |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }} Draft Offences Against the Person Bill, clause 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fetter v. Beale''===
The most significant change in common-law mayhem doctrine came in 1697, when the King's Bench decided ''Fetter v. Beale'', 91 Eng. Rep. 1122. There, the plaintiff recovered in a battery action against a defendant. Shortly thereafter, "part of his skull by reason of the said battery came out of his head", and the plaintiff brought a subsequent action under mayhem. Though ''Fetter'' is also known as an early example of [[res judicata]], it is most significant for expanding the ambit of mayhem to include "loss of the skull".

==The modern doctrine==
In modern times, the offense of mayhem has been superseded in many [[jurisdiction]]s by statutorily defined offenses such as [[aggravated battery]].

==In the United States==
Modern statutes in the U.S. define mayhem as disabling or disfiguring, such as rendering useless a member of another person's arms or legs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=203. Cal. Pen. Code Sec. 203]&lt;/ref&gt; The injury must be permanent, not just a temporary loss.  Some courts will hold even a minor battery as mayhem if the injury is not minor.  Mayhem in the U.S. is a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dix |first=George E. |year=2010 |title=Gilbert Law Summaries on Criminal Law |publisher=Thomson/West |isbn=978-0-314-19430-5 |pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Both the noun "mayhem" and the verb "[[:wiktionary:maim|maim]]" come from [[Old French]] via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]].  The word is first attested in various [[Romance languages]] in the 13th century, but its ultimate origin is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third edition, June 2000; online version June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For one hypothesis about its origin, see [[wiktionary:mayhem|the Wiktionary entry for this word]].

==Other uses==
Mayhem can describe a person going on a [[Killing spree|rampage]]. Popular misunderstanding of the common [[journalese]] expression "[[rioting]] and mayhem" caused the common usual modern use of "mayhem" to mean "havoc and disorder", often with humorous overtones.

{{Planes of existence}}
In  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the '''Monadic Plane'''  is the plane in which the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]]  (also called the [[Holy Spirit]] or the Oversoul) is said to exist.  The term "Monad" is from the Greek word μονάς (monas), which means "singularity", and was used by Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato. The [[Arcane School]] ideas also use the concept of the Monad. Some schools of thought equate the Monadic Plane with the [[Hyperplane]], while others view the Monadic Plane as enclosing and interpenetrating many hyperplanes.

==Theosophical differences==

'Classical' 1800s Theosophy does not say the monad is human, but [[Annie Besant]] &amp; [[Charles Leadbeater]] may have said so, and [[Alice Bailey]] or others, who uses similar ideas, did say so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">The '''name of the father''' ([[French language|French]] '''''{{lang|fr|nom du père}}''''') is a concept that [[Jacques Lacan]] developed from his seminar ''The [[Psychoses]]'' (1955–1956) to cover the role of the father in the [[The Symbolic|Symbolic Order]]. 

Lacan plays with the similar sounds in French of ''{{lang|fr|le nom du père}}'' (the name of the father), ''{{lang|fr|le non du père}}'' (the no of the father), and ''{{lang|fr|les non-dupes errent}}'' (the non-dupes err) to emphasize with the first two phrases the legislative and prohibitive functions of the father and to emphasize with the last phrase that "those who do not let themselves be caught in the symbolic deception/fiction and continue to believe their eyes are the ones who err most".&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Zizek, [http://www.lacan.com/zizpassion.htm "With or Without Passion"], lacan.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and scope==

Lacan's concept draws on the mythical father of [[Freud]]'s ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; and was used by him as a strategic move in his opposition to what he saw as the over-emphasis of [[object relations theory]] on the exclusive relationship of the individual and his/her mother as a dual pair.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lacan emphasised instead the importance of the third party in the [[Oedipus complex]] – what he called "the place that she [the mother] reserves for the Name-of-the Father in the promulgation of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this as a vital element in helping each new member of the human race to move from an exclusive, primary relation to the mother[er] to a wider engagement with the outside, cultural world – the symbolic order.

===Wider horizons===

[[Anthony Stevens (Jungian analyst)|Anthony Stevens]] has similarly argued that "Traditionally, the father's orientation is centrifugal, i. e., towards the outside world...his is the primary responsibility for facilitating the transition from home to society'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens, ''On [[Jung]]'' (London 1990) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the family therapist [[Robin Skynner]] sees the father (or fatherer) playing an essential role in the process whereby "the [[toddler]] has got to see that Mum isn't God as a first step to seeing that Dad isn't God, and that...''he's'' part of something bigger too".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Lacan, that bigger context could be seen as "the chain of discourse...in which an entire family, an entire [[clique|coterie]], an entire camp, an entire nation or half the world will be caught".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internalisation#Psychology and sociology|internalisation]] of the Name of the Father with the passing of the [[Oedipus complex]] ensured for Lacan participation in that wider chain of discourse, and was for him an essential element of human sanity.

==Three paternal functions==

Lacan distinguishes between the Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real father: "It is in the ''name of the father'' that we must recognise the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law" – as distinct from "the narcissistic relations, or even from the real relations, which the subject sustains with the image and action of the person who embodies it".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; This paternal function imposes the law and regulates desire in the Oedipus complex, intervening in the imaginary dual relationship between mother and child to introduce a necessary symbolic distance between them (Dylan Evans). 'The true function of the Father is fundamentally to unite (and not to set in opposition) a desire and the Law' (Écrits), and the Symbolic Father is thus not an actual subject but a position in the Symbolic Order.

By contrast the Imaginary Father is an imago, the composite of all the imaginary constructs that the subject builds up in fantasy around the figure of the father; and may be construed either as an ideal father or as the opposite, the bad father – what [[Slavoj Zizek]] referred to as "the ''reverse'' of the father, the "anal father" who lurks behind the Name-of-the-Father ''qua'' bearer of the symbolic law".&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Zizek, ''Enjoy Your Symptom!'' (London 2008) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; 

As to the real father, Lacan stresses how "the ravaging effects of the paternal figure are to be observed with particular frequency in cases where the father really has the function of a legislator...with too many opportunities of being in a position of undeserving, inadequacy, even of fraud, and, in short, of excluding the Name-of-the-Father from its position in the signifier".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 218–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychosis==

[[Psychosis]] for Lacanians is the exact opposite of the Name of the Father – the absence of that identification with the symbolic order which ensures our place in the shared intersubjective world of common sense.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Zizek, ''Enjoy Your Symptom!'' (London 2008) p. 88 and p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The Name-of-the-Father is thus the fundamental signifier which permits signification to proceed normally. It not only confers identity and position on the subject within the symbolic order, but also signifies the Oedipal prohibition (the "no" of the incest taboo). 

If this signifier is [[Foreclosure (psychoanalysis)|foreclosed]], in the sense of being excluded from the Symbolic Order, the result is psychosis. Psychotics have not been properly separated from their mother[er] by the fixed name-of-the-father, and hence relate to speech and language differently from neurotics.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (1997) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''On a Question Preliminary to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis'' (1957), Lacan represents the Oedipus complex as "the metaphor of the Name-of-the-Father, that is, the metaphor that substitutes this Name in the place first symbolized by the operation of the absence of the mother".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; All paternity thus involves metaphoric substitution. 

Lacan originally presents the 'paternal metaphor' in his Seminar ''La relation d'objet'' (1956–1957): it is the fundamental metaphor on which all signification depends (all signification is phallic). If the Name-of-the-Father is foreclosed, as in psychosis, there can be no paternal metaphor and hence no phallic signification.

==Late Lacan==

In his late seminars, Lacan downplayed the hitherto central importance of the Name-of-the-Father and the Oedipus complex as well, considering them either irrelevant or misleading in terms of his then-current concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Grigg, ''Lacan, Language and Philosophy'' (2008) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">'''Narcissistic supply''' is a concept introduced into [[Psychoanalysis#Theories|psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Otto Fenichel]] in 1938, to describe a type of [[admiration]], [[Social support|interpersonal support]] or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and essential to their [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=fenichel&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenichel|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or excessive need for attention or admiration from [[codependents]], or such a need in the [[Oral stage#Oral-stage fixation|orally fixated]], that does not take into account the feelings, opinions or preferences of other people.

== History ==
Building on Freud's concept of [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the work of his colleague the psychoanalyst [[Karl Abraham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abraham|1927}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fenichel highlighted the narcissistic need in early development for supplies to enable young  children to maintain a sense of mental equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenichel|1996|pp=40, 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified two main strategies for obtaining such narcissistic supplies—aggression and [[ingratiation]]—contrasting styles of approach which could later develop into the sadistic and the submissive respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenichel|1996|pp=41, 352–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A childhood loss of essential supplies was for Fenichel key to a depressive disposition, as well as to a tendency to seek compensatory narcissistic  supplies thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenichel|1996|pp=404–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Impulse neuroses, addictions including [[love addiction]] and [[gambling]] were all seen by him as products of the struggle for supplies in later life.&lt;ref name = "Fenichel 1996 372"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenichel|1996|pp=372, 382 and 510}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst [[Ernst Simmel]] (1920) had earlier considered neurotic [[gambling]] as an attempt to regain primitive love and attention in an adult context.&lt;ref&gt;J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality disorders ==
Psychoanalyst [[Otto Kernberg]] considered the [[Malignant narcissism|malignant narcissistic]] criminal to be coldly characterised by a disregard of others unless they could be [[Idealization and devaluation|idealised]] as sources of narcissistic supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kernberg |first=Otto F. |year=1974 |title=Contrasting Viewpoints Regarding the Nature and Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personalities: A Preliminary Communication |journal=Journal of the American Psychoanalytical Association |volume=22 |pages=255–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self psychology|Self psychologist]] [[Heinz Kohut]] saw those with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] as disintegrating mentally when cut off from a regular source of  narcissistic supply.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''The Chicago Institute Lectures'' (1996) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Those providing supply to such figures may be treated as if they are a part of the narcissist, in an eclipse of all [[personal boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, Sandy &amp; [[James F. Masterson|Masterson, James F.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=HdRvXgeaDmkC&amp;pg=PA28 Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism] (2003) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relationships==
The need for narcissistic supply is considered by some one of the forces driving [[Don Juanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenichel|1996|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as underlying [[Sadomasochism|masochistic relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hoffman/N. Kulik, ''The Clinical Problem of Masochism'' (2012) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In therapy, a client may defend against experiencing [[Transference|transference love]] by turning the therapist into a mere source of impersonal narcissistic supply.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mann ed., ''Erotic Transference and Countertransference'' (2003) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal boundaries===
{{Main|Personal boundaries}}
Those who provide narcissistic supply to the narcissist will be treated as if they are part of the narcissist and be expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist there is no boundary between self and other.&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, Sandy &amp; [[James F. Masterson|Masterson, James F.]] Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In workplace relationships===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
The narcissistic manager will have two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate ([[status symbol]]s like cars, gadgets or office views); and animate ([[flattery]] and [[attention]] from colleagues and subordinates).&lt;ref&gt;A. J. DuBrin, ''Narcissism in the Workplace'' (2012) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Teammates may find everyday offers of [[Social support|support]] swiftly turn them into [[enabling]] sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. DuBrin, ''Narcissism in the Workplace'' (2012) p. 143 and p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The narcissistic manager's need to protect such supply networks will prevent objective decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;S. Allcorn, ''Organizational Dynamics and Intervention'' (2005) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Such a manager will evaluate long-term strategies according to their potential for gaining personal attention.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. DuBrin, ''Narcissism in the Workplace'' (2012) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Yorkers For Children''' (NYFC) was founded in 1996 by [[Nicholas Scoppetta]] in [[Manhattan, New York]] as a not for profit organization helping people who have aged out of the foster care system. The organization focuses on the academic success of  foster children. NYFC's goal is to help all youth in the foster care system succeed academically and with equal opportunity in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=February 12, 2018 | url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org | title=Our Mission | website=newyorkersforchildren.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their partner [[Administration for Children's Services]] (ACS), NYFC is able to provide school supplies, access to academic counselling, job opportunities, access to schools, as well as financial support to keep them in school.

Since its founding New Yorkers For Children has raised and donated over $55 million to its programs, scholarships, and its partnership with ACS.

== Background ==
Nicholas Scoppetta founded NYFC after he was recruited by New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to run the newly formed children service agency. Scopetta was credited for facilitating the re-formulation of the system which resulted in improved training, management, pay, and accountability. He was also successful in getting more children adopted out of the system, reducing case loads, as well as hiring more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/nyregion/nicholas-scoppetta-foster-child-who-became-a-versatile-public-servant-dies-at-83.html|title=Nicholas Scoppetta, Former Foster Child Who Led Child Welfare Agency, Dies at 83|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=March 24, 2016|work=New York Times|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these achievements Scoppetta formed NYFC and was the President of Board of Directors until his retirement in 2013 where he was replaced by Eric Brettschneider. Brettschneider started working in the child welfare and social services in 1967 and has worked in various specializations of that sector ever since. With his experience he has pledged to  "continue the tradition Nick (Scoppetta) established - empowering the child welfare community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T004&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA333316881&amp;docType=Article&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA333316881&amp;searchId=R4&amp;userGroupName=crepuq_bishop&amp;inPS=true|title=New Yorkers For Children Appoints Eric Brettschneider Next President Of The Board Of Directors|last=|first=|date=June 10, 2013|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects==
* '''Back to School Package Program'''
The program aims at supplying people from the foster system with supplies necessary for their successful completion of a bachelor's degree. The package, valued at $1000, comes with a metro pass, laptop, and Amazon gift card intended to help the student purchase more supplies and eliminate some of their disadvantages. NYFC has provided 8,000 packages to 2,500 students in foster care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to School Packages|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/campaigns/give-education-to-children/|website=www.newyorkersforchildren.org|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Nicholas Scopetta Scholarship Program'''
This program provides financial, emotional, and academic support to students to ensure their successful completion of an academic career. Working together with the "private sector, foster care agencies, CUNY (City University of New York, the system of universities in New York) and Private Colleges in New York City" the NYFC has been able to provide a support system for the students in or leaving foster care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicholas Scopetta Scholarship|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/campaigns/nicholas-scoppetta-scholarship-program-formerly-nyfc-guardian-scholars-program/|website=New Yorkers For Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund'''
This Emergency Fund goes to people leaving the foster care system and financially supports them to be able to complete their educations without having to worry about their financial situations too much. Since these students leave the care of the foster system without the traditional support from families they often live pay cheque to pay cheque. Once a financial emergency hits, the students are forced to decide between their education and finding a job to raise funds for their basic needs. The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund provides students with financial support to ensure they continue their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/campaigns/10086/|website=New Yorkers For Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Spirit Award'''
The Spirit Award is given to a student from the foster care system that is succeeding in college as well as demonstrating leadership, commitment to the community, determination, and has shown the ability to overcome barriers. In 2016 the award was given to two students in full ($10,000) and second place prizes were awarded to two students of the value of $2,500.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/New-Yorkers-For-Children-Inc_2016-FS_FINAL.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children, Inc. - Financial Report|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2016|website=Newyorkerforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wrap to Rap'''

The Wrap to Rap is a holiday event where board members, friends of the NYFC, and teens of the community join together to wrap Christmas presents. The gifts go to children in foster care. The event serves as a community event to support the organizations efforts while allowing teens the opportunity to learn of the struggles of others and simultaneously getting them involved in volunteering for the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''The Youth Advisory Board (YAB)'''
The Youth Advisory Board is in charge of promoting social change in regards to changing how the social system supports foster children once they are too old for foster care. Their social policy efforts fight mainly for affordable housing, post secondary opportunities, and funding for college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Funding ==
New Yorkers For Children makes most of its revenues from foundation and business organizations contributions. In 2016 alone the organization made $3.2 million in foundation and business organizations contributions. NYFC's special events bring in the second largest amount of revenue. From 2012 to 2016 NYFC's events brought in on average $2.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/New-Yorkers-For-Children-Inc_2016-FS_FINAL.pdf|title=Annual Report 2016|website=New Yorker For Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-Audited-Financial-Statements.pdf|title=New Yorker For Children Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2015|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/financial-statements.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2014|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Financial-Statements.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children Annual Report 2012 &amp; 2013|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2013|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each event honours a few of the children receiving aid from the foundation and supplies them with proper clothing attire for the night. The events are also each sponsored by a big brand or corporation, for example [[Chloé]] and by [[Circa]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/new-yorkers-for-children-fall-gala|title=Everyone Wins|last=Vanessa|first=Lawrence|date=September 17, 2015|website=WMagazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gotham-magazine.com/2010-new-yorkers-for-children-fall-gala-presented-by-circa|title=2010 New Yorkers For Children Fall Gala Presented by Circa|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2010|website=Gotham Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Spring Dinner Dance was presented by [[Saks Fifth Avenue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/events-page/2015-spring-dinner-dance-fools-fete/|title=2015 Spring Dinner Dance Presented by Saks Fifth Avenue|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newyorkerforchildren.org|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fool's Fete of 2012 was sponsored by CD Greene. Each of these big named sponsors bring in different crowds of people to the events and increases and diversifies the organizations base of donors.
* '''The New Yorkers For Children Annual Fall Gala'''
Held every year in the fall, NYFC's New Yorker For Children Annual Fall Gala at Cipriani 42nd Street consistently raises over $1.2 million. With tickets starting at $1,200 and tables being sold for up to $50,000, the evening is always a success for the organization. The event is attended by actors, designers, athletes, journalists, artists, wealthy business entrepreneurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA463958528&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Kelly happy with 'Children'|last=|first=|date=September 17, 2016|work=New York Post|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and singers all willing to spend big money for charity. The Gala is meant to raise money as well as acknowledge people for their own charitable efforts. It also receives media coverage from well known news outlets like Vogue, InStyle, and New Getty.
* '''New Yorkers For Children Spring Dinner Dance'''
In 2015 the event held at the Mandarin Oriental raised $750,000 with tickets selling out before they are made open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/events-page/2016-spring-dinner-dance/|title=2016 Spring Dinner Dance|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newyorkersforchildren.org|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the event was publicized not only for its philanthropic work but also because it honoured the fashion legend [[Oscar de la Renta]] giving the event an edge in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;id=GALE%7CA410561283&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1|title=Oscar dresses glam gala|last=|first=|date=April 19, 2015|work=New York Post|access-date=February 21, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More attention is brought to the event due to the attendance of well known people like actress [[Emma Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA365668823&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Springtime for stars &amp; kids|last=|first=|date=April 23, 2014|work=New York Post|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as royalty of a Saudi Prince&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA325862252&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Don't take my number|last=|first=|date=April 11, 2013|work=New York Post|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013. Although the event does not raise as much money as the Annual Fall Gala, the publicity that the organization gets largely affects its donations.

== Public Support ==
New Yorkers For Children receives a lot of supports from public figures, actors, artists, singers, athletes, etc. In 2009 [[Anderson Cooper]], anchor for CNN, hosted the annual fall gala. This night included awarding [[Mary J. Blige]] the Nicholas Scoppetta Child Welfare Award for her own organization FFAWN which empowers and supports women to go to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=February 20, 2018 | url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;id=GALE%7CA208580480&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1 | title=School Ties | date=September 24, 2009 | website=wwd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the annual fall gala also included [[Ne-Yo]] performing his hit songs and Oscar-nominated director [[Tony Gilroy]] premiered his short film about eight youth in foster care. 19 youth who receive aid from NYFC were guests of honour. [[Macy's]] provided them with clothing while [[MAC Cosmetics]] and French hairstylist [[Frédéric Fekkai|Frederic Fekkai]] provided hair and makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/events-page/tenth-annual-fall-gala/|title=Tenth Annual Fall Gala|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newyorkersforchildren.org|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Hugh Jackman]] co-chaired the event with his wife [[Deborra-lee Furness|Deborra-Lee Furness]]. Jackman expressed his appreciation and support for New Yorkers For Children: "I love what New Yorkers for Children does. It's at a grass-roots level, it doesn't throw money here and there, it really looks after kids with what they need emotionally as well as financially."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA343331226&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Power crowd for kids|last=|first=|date=September 19, 2013|work=New York Post|access-date=February 21, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work With Administration for Children Services ==
New Yorkers For Children is partnered with the government organization Administration for Children Services (ACS). NYFC supports the organization's projects financially. In 2016 the NYFC donated $100,000 in grants to fund the Community Connections Project, The Door Project, and ACS Special Programs and Events. The Community Connections Project is a detention release initiative that works to support low risk individuals that are being removed from detention and rehabilitated in their homes with their families. The Door project works to offer homeless people and "system-involved" young people better access to post-secondary opportunities. This initiative is community based and supported by education services, and external partnerships. ACS Special Programs and Events promotes child wellbeing projects specifically Safe Sleep Symposium and Child Abuse Awareness month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/New-Yorkers-For-Children-Inc_2016-FS_FINAL.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children Inc. 2016 Financial Report - Pilot and innovative programs|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2016|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25454">In [[mathematics]], '''non-standard calculus''' is the modern application of [[infinitesimals]], in the sense of [[non-standard analysis]], to differential and integral calculus.  It provides a rigorous justification for some arguments in [[infinitesimal calculus|calculus]] that were previously considered merely heuristic.

Nonrigourous calculations with infinitesimals were widely used before [[Karl Weierstrass]] sought to replace them with the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] starting in the 1870s.  (See [[history of calculus]].) For almost one hundred years thereafter, mathematicians like [[Richard Courant]] viewed infinitesimals as being naive and vague or meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Courant described infinitesimals on page 81 of ''Differential and Integral Calculus, Vol I'', as "devoid of any clear meaning" and "naive befogging". Similarly on page 101, Courant described them as "incompatible with the clarity of ideas demanded in mathematics", "entirely meaningless", "fog which hung round the foundations", and a "hazy idea".&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--On this paragraph, see Talk, three sections that mention Courant and/or quotations--&gt;

Contrary to such views, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed in 1960 that infinitesimals are precise, clear, and meaningful, building upon work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy Łoś]]. According to [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Howard Keilser]], "Robinson solved a three hundred year old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals.  Robinson's achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of non-standard calculus began with the use of infinitely small quantities, called [[infinitesimal]]s in [[calculus]].  The use of infinitesimals can be found the foundations of calculus independently developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]] starting in the 1660s. [[John Wallis]] refined earlier techniques of [[indivisibles]] of [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] and others by exploiting an [[infinitesimal]] quantity he denoted &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; in area calculations, preparing the ground for integral [[calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J.F. 1981. "The Mathematical Work of John Wallis, D.D., F.R.S. (1616&amp;ndash;1703)". Chelsea Publishing Co. New York, NY. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They drew on the work of such mathematicians as [[Pierre de Fermat]], [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[René Descartes]].

In early calculus the use of [[infinitesimal]] quantities was criticized by a number of authors, most notably [[Michel Rolle]] and [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]''.

Several mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], advocated the use of limits. [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] developed a versatile spectrum of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|ε, δ argument]] in working with differentiation. [[Karl Weierstrass]] formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]&lt;!--correct link?--&gt; in the context of a (real) number system without infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on ε, δ arguments instead of infinitesimals.

This approach formalized by Weierstrass came to be known as the ''standard'' calculus.  After many years of the infinitesimal approach to calculus having fallen into disuse other than as an introductory pedagogical tool, use of infinitesimal quantities was finally given a rigorous foundation by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s.  Robinson's approach is called [[non-standard analysis]] to distinguish it from the standard use of limits.  This approach used technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to create a theory of [[hyperreal number]]s that interpret infinitesimals in a manner that allows a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. An alternative approach, developed by [[Edward Nelson]], finds infinitesimals on the ordinary real line itself, and involves a modification of the foundational setting by extending [[ZFC]] through the introduction of a new unary predicate "standard".

==Motivation==

To calculate the derivative &lt;math&gt;f '&lt;/math&gt; of the function &lt;math&gt; y =f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; at ''x'', both approaches agree on the algebraic manipulations:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{(x + \Delta  x)^2 - x^2}{\Delta  x} = \frac{2 x \Delta x + (\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x} = 2 x  + \Delta x \approx 2 x&lt;/math&gt;

This becomes a computation of the derivatives using the [[hyperreals]] if we interpret &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; as an infinitesimal and let the symbol "&lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt;" be the relation "is infinitely close to".

In order to make ''f ''' a real-valued function, we must dispense with the final term &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. In the standard approach using only real numbers, that is done by taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; tends to zero. In the [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] approach, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be an infinitesimal, a nonzero number that is closer to 0 than to any nonzero real. The manipulations displayed above then show that &lt;math&gt;\Delta y /\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely close to 2''x'', so the derivative of ''f'' at ''x'' is then 2''x''.

Discarding the "error term" is accomplished by an application of the [[standard part function]]. Dispensing with infinitesimal error terms was historically considered paradoxical by some writers, most notably [[George Berkeley]].

Once the hyperreal number system (an infinitesimal-enriched continuum) is in place, one has successfully incorporated a large part of the technical difficulties at the foundational level.  Thus, the [[epsilon, delta technique]]s that some believe to be the essence of analysis can be implemented once and for all at the foundational level, and the students needn't be "dressed to perform multiple-quantifier logical stunts on pretense of being taught [[infinitesimal calculus]]", to quote a recent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Keisler's textbook==
Keisler's [[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]] defines continuity on page 125 in terms of infinitesimals, to the exclusion of epsilon, delta methods.
The derivative is defined on page 45 using infinitesimals rather than an epsilon-delta approach.
The integral is defined on page 183 in terms of infinitesimals.
Epsilon, delta definitions are introduced on page 282.

==Definition of derivative==

The [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] can be constructed in the framework of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the standard axiomatisation of set theory used elsewhere in mathematics.  To give an intuitive idea for the hyperreal approach, note that, naively speaking, non-standard analysis postulates the existence of positive numbers ε ''which  are infinitely small'', meaning that ε is smaller than any standard positive real, yet greater than zero.  Every real number ''x'' is surrounded by an infinitesimal "cloud" of hyperreal numbers infinitely close to it.  To define the derivative of ''f'' at a standard real number ''x'' in this approach, one no longer needs an infinite limiting process as in standard calculus.  Instead, one sets

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \mathrm{st} \left( \frac{f^*(x+\varepsilon)-f^*(x)}{\varepsilon} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where '''st''' is the [[standard part function]], yielding the real number infinitely close to the hyperreal argument of '''st''', and &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is the natural extension of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to the hyperreals.

==Continuity==
A real function ''f'' is continuous at a standard real number ''x'' if for every hyperreal ''x' '' infinitely close to ''x'', the value ''f''(''x' '') is also infinitely close to ''f''(''x'').  This captures [[Cauchy]]'s definition of continuity as presented in his 1821 textbook [[Cours d'Analyse]], p.&amp;nbsp;34.

Here to be precise, ''f'' would have to be replaced by its natural hyperreal extension usually denoted ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (see discussion of [[Transfer principle]] in main article at [[Non-standard analysis#Internal sets|non-standard analysis]]).

Using the notation &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; for the relation of being infinitely close as above,
the definition can be extended to arbitrary (standard or non-standard) points as follows:

A function ''f'' is ''[[microcontinuous]]'' at ''x'' if whenever &lt;math&gt;x'\approx x&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;f^*(x')\approx f^*(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Here the point x' is assumed to be in the domain of (the natural extension of) ''f''.

The above requires fewer quantifiers than the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(''ε'',&amp;nbsp;''δ'')-definition]] familiar from  standard elementary calculus:

''f'' is continuous at ''x'' if for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for every ''x' '', whenever |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'&amp;thinsp;''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ'', one has |''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'&amp;thinsp;'')|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ε''.

==Uniform continuity==
A function ''f'' on an interval ''I'' is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if its natural extension ''f''* in ''I''* has the following property (see Keisler, Foundations of Infinitesimal Calculus ('07), p.&amp;nbsp;45):

for every pair of hyperreals ''x'' and ''y'' in ''I''*, if &lt;math&gt;x\approx y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f^*(x)\approx f^*(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

In terms of microcontinuity defined in the previous section, this can be stated as follows: a real function is uniformly continuous if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous at every point of the domain of f*.

This definition has a reduced quantifier complexity when compared with the standard [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(ε,&amp;nbsp;δ)-definition]].  Namely, the epsilon-delta definition of uniform continuity requires four quantifiers, while the infinitesimal definition requires only two quantifiers.  It has the same quantifier complexity as the definition of uniform continuity in terms of ''sequences'' in standard calculus, which however is not expressible in the [[first-order logic|first-order language]] of the real numbers.

The hyperreal definition can be illustrated by the following three examples.

Example 1: a function ''f'' is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval (0,1], if and only if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous (in the sense of the formula above) at every positive infinitesimal, in addition to continuity at the standard points of the interval.

Example 2: a function ''f'' is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval [0,∞) if and only if it is continuous at the standard points of the interval, and in addition, the natural extension ''f''* is microcontinuous at every positive infinite hyperreal point.

Example 3: similarly, the failure of uniform continuity for the squaring function

:&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is due to the absence of microcontinuity at a single infinite hyperreal point, see below.

Concerning quantifier complexity, the following remarks were made by [[Kevin Houston (mathematician)|Kevin Houston]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Houston (mathematician)|Kevin Houston]], How to Think Like a Mathematician, {{ISBN|978-0-521-71978-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The number of quantifiers in a mathematical statement gives a rough measure of the statement’s complexity. Statements involving three or more quantifiers can be difficult to understand. This is the main reason why it is hard to understand the rigorous definitions of limit, convergence, continuity and differentiability in analysis as they have many quantifiers.  In fact, it is the alternation of the &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; that causes the complexity.

[[Andreas Blass]] wrote as follows:
:Often ... the nonstandard definition of a concept is simpler than the standard definition (both intuitively simpler and simpler in a technical sense, such as quantifiers over lower types or fewer alternations of quantifiers).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Andreas|last1=Blass

==Compactness==

A set A is compact if and only if its natural extension A* has the following property: every point in A* is infinitely close to a point of A.  Thus, the open interval (0,1) is not compact because its natural extension contains positive infinitesimals which are not infinitely close to any positive real number.

==Heine–Cantor theorem==
The fact that a continuous function on a compact interval ''I'' is necessarily uniformly continuous (the [[Heine–Cantor theorem]]) admits a succinct hyperreal proof.  Let ''x'', ''y'' be hyperreals in the natural extension ''I*'' of ''I''.  Since ''I'' is compact, both st(''x'') and st(''y'') belong to ''I''.  If ''x'' and ''y'' were infinitely close, then by the triangle inequality, they would have the same standard part

:&lt;math&gt;c = \operatorname{st}(x) = \operatorname{st}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the function is assumed continuous at c, we have

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\approx f(c)\approx f(y),&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore ''f''(''x'') and ''f''(''y'') are infinitely close, proving uniform continuity of ''f''.

==Why is the squaring function not uniformly continuous?==

Let ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;N\in \mathbb{R}^*&lt;/math&gt; be an infinite hyperreal.  The hyperreal number &lt;math&gt;N + \tfrac{1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely close to ''N''.  Meanwhile, the difference

:&lt;math&gt; f(N+\tfrac{1}{N}) - f(N) = N^2 + 2 + \tfrac{1}{N^2} - N^2 = 2 + \tfrac{1}{N^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is not infinitesimal.   Therefore, ''f*'' fails to be microcontinuous at the hyperreal point ''N''.  Thus, the squaring function is not uniformly continuous, according to the definition in [[Non-standard calculus#Uniform continuity|uniform continuity]] above.

A similar proof may be given in the standard setting {{harv|Fitzpatrick|2006|loc=Example 3.15}}.

==Example: Dirichlet function==
Consider the [[Dirichlet function]]
:&lt;math&gt;I_Q(x):=\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if }x \text{ is rational}, \\
0 &amp; \text{ if } x \text{ is irrational}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It is well known that, under the [[continuous function|standard definition of continuity]], the function is discontinuous at every point.  Let us check this in terms of the hyperreal definition of continuity above, for instance let us show that the Dirichlet function is not continuous at π.  Consider the continued fraction approximation a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of π.  Now let the index n be an infinite [[hypernatural]] number.  By the [[transfer principle]], the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes the value 1 at a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Note that the hyperrational point a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is infinitely close to π.  Thus the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes different values (0 and 1) at these two infinitely close points, and therefore the Dirichlet function is not continuous at&amp;nbsp;''π''.

==Limit==
While the thrust of Robinson's approach is that one can dispense with the approach using multiple quantifiers, the notion of limit can be easily recaptured in terms of the [[standard part function]] '''st''', namely

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if whenever the difference ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' is infinitesimal, the difference ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''L'' is infinitesimal, as well, or in formulas:

:if st(''x'') = ''a''&amp;nbsp;  then st(''f''(''x'')) = L,

cf. [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]].

==Limit of sequence==
Given a sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\{x_n|n\in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;L\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we say ''L'' is '''the limit''' of the sequence and write

::&lt;math&gt; L = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt;

if for every infinite [[hypernatural]] ''n'', we have st(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)=L (here the extension principle is used to define x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for every hyperinteger n).

This definition has no [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] alternations.The standard  [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(ε, δ)-style]] definition on the other hand does have quantifier alternations:

::&lt;math&gt;L = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n\Longleftrightarrow \forall \epsilon&gt;0\;, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}\;,  \forall n \in \mathbb{N} : n &gt;N \rightarrow  |x_n-L|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

==Extreme value theorem==

To show that a real continuous function ''f'' on [0,1] has a maximum, let ''N'' be an infinite [[hyperinteger]].  The interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] has a natural hyperreal extension.  The function ''f'' is also naturally extended to hyperreals between 0 and 1.  Consider the partition of the hyperreal interval [0,1] into ''N'' subintervals of equal [[infinitesimal]] length 1/''N'', with partition points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''i''&amp;nbsp;/''N'' as ''i'' "runs" from 0 to ''N''.  In the standard setting (when ''N'' is finite), a point with the maximal value of ''f'' can always be chosen among the ''N''+1 points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, by induction.  Hence, by the [[transfer principle]], there is a hyperinteger ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that 0&amp;nbsp;≤ ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''N'' and &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i_0})\geq f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N'' (an alternative explanation is that every [[hyperfinite set]] admits a maximum).  Consider the real point

:&lt;math&gt;c= {\rm st}(x_{i_0})&lt;/math&gt;

where '''st''' is the [[standard part function]].  An arbitrary real point ''x'' lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely &lt;math&gt;x\in [x_i,x_{i+1}]&lt;/math&gt;, so that '''st'''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;= ''x''.  Applying '''st''' to the inequality &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i_0})\geq f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;{\rm st}(f(x_{i_0}))\geq {\rm st}(f(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;.  By continuity of ''f'' we have
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm st}(f(x_{i_0}))= f({\rm st} (x_{i_0}))=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence ''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;≥ ''f''(''x''), for all ''x'', proving ''c'' to be a maximum of the real function ''f''.  See {{harvtxt |Keisler|1986|p=164}}.

==Intermediate value theorem==

As another illustration of the power of [[Abraham Robinson|Robinson]]'s approach, we present a short proof of the [[intermediate value theorem]] (Bolzano's theorem) using infinitesimals.

Let ''f'' be a continuous function on [''a,b''] such that ''f(a)&lt;0'' while ''f(b)&gt;0''.  Then there exists a point ''c'' in [''a,b''] such that ''f(c)=0''.

The proof proceeds as follows.  Let ''N'' be an infinite [[hyperinteger]].  Consider a partition of [''a,b''] into ''N'' intervals of equal length, with partition points ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' as ''i'' runs from 0 to ''N''.  Consider the collection ''I'' of indices such that ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&gt;0''.  Let ''i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the least element in ''I'' (such an element exists by the [[transfer principle]], as ''I'' is a [[hyperfinite set]]).  Then the real number

&lt;math&gt;c=\mathrm{st}(x_{i_0})&lt;/math&gt;

is the desired zero of ''f''.
Such a proof reduces the [[Predicate logic|quantifier]] complexity of a standard proof of the IVT.

== Basic theorems ==

If ''f'' is a real valued function defined on an interval [''a'', ''b''], then the transfer operator applied to ''f'', denoted by ''*f'',  is an ''internal'', hyperreal-valued function defined on the hyperreal interval [*''a'', *''b''].

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''f'' be a real-valued function defined on an
interval [''a'', ''b'']. Then ''f'' is differentiable at ''a &lt; x &lt; b'' if and only if
for every ''non-zero'' infinitesimal ''h'', the value

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_h f := \operatorname{st} \frac{[{}^*\!f](x+h)-[{}^*\!f](x)}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

is independent of ''h''.  In that case, the common value is the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.

This fact follows from the [[transfer principle]] of non-standard analysis and [[overspill]].

Note that a similar result holds for differentiability at the endpoints ''a'', ''b'' provided the sign of the infinitesimal ''h'' is suitably restricted.

For the second theorem, we consider the Riemann integral.  This integral is defined as the limit, if it exists, of a directed family of ''Riemann sums''; these are sums of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(\xi_k) (x_{k+1} - x_k) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 \leq \xi_0 \leq x_1 \leq \ldots x_{n-1} \leq \xi_{n-1} \leq x_n = b.&lt;/math&gt;

We will call such a sequence of values a ''partition'' or ''mesh'' and

:&lt;math&gt; \sup_k (x_{k+1} - x_k) &lt;/math&gt;

the width of the mesh.  In the definition of the Riemann integral, the limit of the Riemann sums is taken as the width of the mesh goes to 0.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''f'' be a real-valued function defined on an
interval [''a'', ''b'']. Then ''f'' is Riemann-integrable on [''a'', ''b''] if and only if
for every internal mesh of infinitesimal width, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt; S_M = \operatorname{st} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [*f](\xi_k) (x_{k+1} - x_k) &lt;/math&gt;

is independent of the mesh.  In this case, the common value is
the Riemann integral of ''f'' over [''a'', ''b''].

== Applications ==

One immediate application is an extension of the standard definitions of differentiation and integration to [[internal set|internal function]]s on intervals of hyperreal numbers.

An internal hyperreal-valued function ''f'' on [''a, b''] is ''S''-differentiable at ''x'', provided

:&lt;math&gt;  \Delta_h f = \operatorname{st} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

exists and is independent of the infinitesimal ''h''. The value is the ''S'' derivative at ''x''.

'''Theorem'''.  Suppose ''f'' is ''S''-differentiable at every point of [''a, b''] where ''b'' &amp;minus; ''a'' is a bounded hyperreal.  Suppose furthermore that

:&lt;math&gt; |f'(x)| \leq M \quad a \leq x \leq b. &lt;/math&gt;

Then for some infinitesimal ε

:&lt;math&gt; |f(b) - f(a)| \leq M (b-a) +  \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this, let ''N'' be a non-standard natural number.  Divide the interval [''a'', ''b''] into ''N'' subintervals by placing ''N'' &amp;minus; 1 equally spaced  intermediate points:

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 &lt;  x_1&lt; \cdots &lt; x_{N-1} &lt; x_N = b&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt; |f(b) - f(a)|  \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} |f(x_{k+1}) - f(x_{k})| \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \left\{|f'(x_k)| + \epsilon_k\right\}|x_{k+1} - x_{k}|.&lt;/math&gt;

Now the maximum of any internal set of infinitesimals is infinitesimal.  Thus all the ε&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'s are dominated by an infinitesimal ε. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; |f(b) - f(a)|  \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (M + \epsilon)(x_{k+1} - x_{k}) = M(b-a) + \epsilon (b-a)&lt;/math&gt;

from which the result follows.

'''Omnipotence''' is the quality of having unlimited power. [[Monotheism|Monotheistic]] [[religion]]s generally attribute omnipotence to only the [[deity]] of their faith. In the monotheistic [[religious philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Abrahamic religions]], omnipotence is often listed as one of a deity's characteristics among many, including [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], and [[omnibenevolence]]. The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable [[theological]] debate, prominently including the problem of [[theodicy]], the question of why such a deity would permit the manifestation of evil.

==Meanings==
The term omnipotent has been used to connote a number of different positions. These positions include, but are not limited to, the following:
# A deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] ''City of God''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A deity is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature (thus, for instance, if it is a [[logical consequence]] of a deity's nature that what it speaks is truth, then it is not able to [[lie]]).
# It is part of a deity's nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for said deity to go against its own laws unless there was a reason to do so.&lt;ref name="scireligion"&gt;This is a consistent theme of Polkinghorne's work, see e.g. Polkinghorne's ''Science and Religion''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A deity can bring about any state of affairs which is logically possible for anyone to bring about in that situation.
# A deity is able to do anything that corresponds with its [[omniscience]] and therefore with its worldplan.
# Every action performed in the world is 'actually' being performed by the deity, either due to omni-[[immanence]], or because all actions must be 'supported' or 'permitted' by the deity.

Under many philosophical definitions of the term "deity", senses 2, 3 and 4 can be shown to be equivalent. However, on all understandings of omnipotence, it is generally held that a deity is able to intervene in the world by superseding the laws of physics, since they are not part of its nature, but the principles on which it has created the physical world.  However many modern scholars (such as [[John Polkinghorne]]) hold that it is part of a deity's nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for a deity to go against its own laws unless there were an overwhelming reason to do so.&lt;ref name="scireligion"/&gt;

The word "Omnipotence" derives from the Latin term "''Omni Potens''", meaning "All-Powerful" instead of "Infinite Power" implied by its English counterpart. The term could be applied to both deities and Roman Emperors. Being the one with "All the power", it was not uncommon for nobles to attempt to prove their Emperor's "''Omni Potens''" to the people, by demonstrating his effectiveness at leading the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;This presents the most controversy when applied to Abrahamic Religions, since there was no word for "Infinite Power" in ancient Semitic Languages like Hebrew or Aramaic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic definition===
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas, OP]] acknowledged difficulty in comprehending the Deity's power: "All confess that God is omnipotent; but it seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we say that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter aright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, 'God can do all things,' is rightly understood to mean that God can do all things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be omnipotent."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25, A. 3, Respondeo; quoted from [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province, at ''New Advent'', copyright 2008 by Kevin Knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm |date=2011-11-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the scholastic understanding, omnipotence is generally understood to be compatible with certain limitations or restrictions. A proposition that is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] is one whose negation is self-contradictory.
:"It is sometimes objected that this aspect of omnipotence involves the contradiction that God cannot do all that He can do; but the argument is sophistical; it is no contradiction to assert that God can realize whatever is possible, but that no number of actualized possibilities exhausts His power. Omnipotence is perfect power, free from all mere potentiality. Hence, although God does not bring into external being all that He is able to accomplish, His power must not be understood as passing through successive stages before its effect is accomplished. The activity of God is simple and eternal, without evolution or change. The transition from possibility to actuality or from act to potentiality, occurs only in creatures. When it is said that God can or could do a thing, the terms are not to be understood in the sense in which they are applied to created causes, but as conveying the idea of a Being possessed of infinite unchangeable power, the range of Whose activity is limited only by His sovereign Will".&lt;ref&gt;CITATION NEEDED; probably St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Thomas explains that:
: "Power is predicated of God not as something really distinct from His knowledge and will, but as differing from them logically; inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting into execution what the will commands, and what knowledge directs, which three things in God are identified. Or we may say, that the knowledge or will of God, according as it is the effective principle, has the notion of power contained in it. Hence the consideration of the knowledge and will of God precedes the consideration of His power, as the cause precedes the operation and effect."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25, A. 1, Ad 4; quoted from [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province, at ''New Advent'', copyright 2008 by Kevin Knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm |date=2011-11-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omnipotence is all-sufficient power. The adaptation of means to ends in the universe does not argue, as J. S. Mill would have it, that the power of the designer is limited, but only that God has willed to manifest his glory by a world so constituted rather than by another. Indeed, the production of secondary causes, capable of accomplishing certain effects, requires greater power than the direct accomplishment of these same effects. On the other hand, even though no creature existed, God's power would not be barren, for "creatures are not an end to God."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', incomplete citation.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Deity's power, medieval theologians contended that there are certain things that even an omnipotent deity cannot do. The statement "a deity can do anything" is only sensible with an assumed suppressed clause, "that implies the perfection of true power". This standard scholastic answer allows that acts of creatures such as walking can be performed by humans but not by a deity. Rather than an advantage in power, human acts such as walking, sitting, or giving birth were possible only because of a ''defect'' in human power. The capacity to [[sin]], for example, is not a power but a defect or infirmity. In response to questions of a deity performing impossibilities, e.g. making square circles, St. Thomas says that "everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them. Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: 'No word shall be impossible with God.' For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word, because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

In recent times, [[C. S. Lewis]] has adopted a scholastic position in the course of his work ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''. Lewis follows Aquinas' view on contradiction:
{{quotation|His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power. If you choose to say 'God can give a creature [[free will]] and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying ''anything'' about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can.'... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.|Lewis, 18}}

==In psychology==
Early [[Freud]]ianism saw a feeling of omnipotence as intrinsic to early childhood. 'As Freud and [[Sándor Ferenczi|Ferenczi]] have shown, the child lives in a sort of [[megalomania]] for a long period...the "fiction of omnipotence"'.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; At birth. 'the baby ''is'' everything ''as far as he knows'' - "all powerful"...every step he takes towards establishing his own limits and boundaries will be painful because he'll have to lose this original God-like feeling of omnipotence'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud considered that in a neurotic 'the ''omnipotence'' which he ascribed to his thoughts and feelings...is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[narcissists]], the 'period of [[primary narcissism]] which subjectively did not need any objects and was entirely independent...may be retained or regressively regained..."omnipotent" behavior'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 509-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. W. Winnicott]] took a more positive view of a belief in early omnipotence, seeing it as essential to the child's well-being; and "good-enough" mothering as essential to enable the child to 'cope with the immense shock of loss of omnipotence'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; - as opposed to whatever 'prematurely forces it out of its narcissistic universe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/infantile-omnipotence |title=Infantile Omnipotence |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejection or limitation==
Some monotheists reject the view that a deity is or could be omnipotent, or take the view that, by choosing to create creatures with freewill, a deity has chosen to limit divine omnipotence.  In [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]], and some movements within [[Protestant Christianity]], including [[open theism]], deities are said to act in the world through persuasion, and not by coercion (this is a matter of choice—a deity could act miraculously, and perhaps on occasion does so—while for process theism it is a matter of necessity—creatures have inherent powers that a deity cannot, even in principle, override).  Deities are manifested in the world through inspiration and the creation of possibility, not necessarily by [[miracle]]s or violations of the laws of nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The rejection of omnipotence often follows from either philosophical or scriptural considerations, discussed below.

===Philosophical grounds===
Process theology rejects unlimited omnipotence on a philosophical basis, arguing that omnipotence as classically understood would be less than perfect, and is therefore incompatible with the idea of a perfect deity. The idea is grounded in Plato's oft-overlooked statement that "being is power."
{{quotation|My notion would be, that anything which possesses any sort of power to affect another, or to be affected by another, if only for a single moment, however trifling the cause and however slight the
effect, has real existence; and I hold that the definition of being is simply power.|Plato, 247E&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=2005-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this premise, [[Charles Hartshorne]] argues further that:
{{quotation|Power is influence, and perfect power is perfect influence ... power must be exercised upon something, at least if by power we mean influence, control; but the something controlled cannot be absolutely inert, since the merely passive, that which has no active tendency of its own, is nothing; yet if the something acted upon is itself partly active, then there must be some resistance, however slight, to the "absolute" power, and how can power which is resisted be absolute?|Hartshorne, 89}}

The argument can be stated as follows:
:1) If a being exists, then it must have some active tendency.
:2) If a being has some active tendency, then it has some power to resist its creator.
:3) If a being has the power to resist its creator, then the creator does not have absolute power.

For example, though someone might control a lump of jelly-pudding almost completely, the inability of that pudding to stage any resistance renders that person's power rather unimpressive. Power can only be said to be great if it is over something that has defenses and its own agenda. If a deity's power is to be great, it must therefore be over beings that have at least some of their own defenses and agenda. Thus, if a deity does not have absolute power, it must therefore embody some of the characteristics of power, and some of the characteristics of persuasion. This view is known as [[dipolar theism]].

The most popular works espousing this point are from [[Harold Kushner]] (in Judaism).  The need for a modified view of omnipotence was also articulated by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in the early 20th century and expanded upon by the aforementioned philosopher Charles Hartshorne. Hartshorne proceeded within the context of the theological system known as process theology.

===Scriptural grounds===
In the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], as well as several other versions, in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 19:6 it is stated "...the Lord God omnipotent reigneth" (the original Greek word is παντοκράτωρ, "all-mighty").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3841.htm |title=Strong's Greek Dictionary: 3841. pantokrator (pan-tok-rat'-ore) |publisher=Strongsnumbers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319205959/http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3841.htm |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uncertainty and other views==
All the above stated claims of power are each based on scriptural grounds and upon [[empirical]] human perception. This perception is limited to our [[senses]]. The power of a deity is related to its existence.There are however other ways of perception like: [[reason]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[revelation]], [[divine inspiration]], [[religious experience]], [[mystical| mystical states]], and historical testimony.

According to the Hindu philosophy the essence of God or [[Brahman]] can never be understood or known since Brahman is beyond both existence and non-existence, transcending and including time, causation and space, and thus can never be known in the same material sense as one traditionally 'understands' a given concept or object.&lt;ref name="gita"&gt;''brahmano hi pratisthaham'', [[Bhagavad Gita]] 14.27&lt;/ref&gt;

So presuming there is a god-like entity consciently taking actions, we cannot comprehend the limits of a deity's powers.&lt;ref name="sex"&gt;Since this article deals on the all power of a deity, it would be logic to assign deities to both sexes. Since having only one sex would make a deity less powerful and thus no longer all-powerful. This article is also not (only) on omnipotence of the biblical God, there are other monotheistic religions who consider their God having both sexes ([[Shaktism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]]). These aspects are not meant literally, but are aspects of divinity to illustrate a duality just as the [[Tao]] in [[Taoism]] consists of [[yin and yang]].
Also an anthropocentric perspective seems at odds with many philosophers, such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the current laws of physics are only known to be valid in this universe, it is possible that the laws of physics are different in parallel universes, giving a God-like entity more power. If the number of universes is unlimited, then the power of a certain God-like entity is also unlimited, since the laws of physics may be different in other universes, and accordingly&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html |title=String Theory and Parallel universes |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20060606234642/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html |archivedate=2006-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making this entity omnipotent. Unfortunately concerning a multiverse there is a lack of empirical correlation. To the extreme there are theories about realms beyond this [[multiverse]] ([[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]], [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], [[Nothingness]]).

Also trying to develop a theory to explain, assign or reject omnipotence on grounds of logic has little merit, since being omnipotent, in a Cartesian sense, would mean the omnipotent being is above logic, a view supported by [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="rene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/ |title=Descartes' Ontological Argument |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He issues this idea in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy]]. This view is called universal possibilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Logical Truth and Omnipotence|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/logical-truth-and-omnipotence|accessdate=20 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520215755/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/logical-truth-and-omnipotence|archivedate=20 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing assumption that a deity exists, further debate may be provoked that said deity is consciously taking actions. It could be concluded from an [[emanationism]]&lt;ref name="eman_cath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05397b.htm |title=Catholic view on emanationism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805012018/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05397b.htm |archivedate=2011-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eman_hindu"&gt;{{cite web |author=M.Alan Kazlev |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/religion/Hindu_emanationism.htm |title=Hindu view on emanationism |publisher=Kheper.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514062547/http://www.kheper.net/topics/religion/Hindu_emanationism.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; point of view, that all actions and creations by a deity are simply flows of divine energy (the flowing [[Tao]] in conjunction with [[qi]] is often seen as a river;&lt;ref name="river"&gt;Tao Te Ching Chapter LXI Verse 140 [http://www.friesian.com/taote.htm Comments on the Tao Te Ching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224052803/http://www.friesian.com/taote.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharma (Buddhism)]] the law of nature discovered by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] has no beginning or end.)
[[Pantheism]] and [[pandeism]] see the universe/multiverse itself as God (or, at least, the current state of God), while [[panentheism]] sees the universe/multiverse as 'the body of God', making 'God' everybody and everything. So if one does something, actually 'God' is doing it. We are 'God's' means according to this view.

In the [[Taoist]] religious or philosophical tradition, the Tao is in some ways equivalent to a deity or the [[logos]]. The Tao is understood to have inexhaustible power, yet that power is simply another aspect of its weakness.

In [[engineering]], some methods or components make special demands on the system.  The extra design features necessary to accommodate these demands are called '''overhead'''. For instance, in [[electrical engineering]], a particular [[integrated circuit]] might draw large [[electric current|current]], requiring a robust power delivery circuit and a heat-dissipation mechanism.

== Example ==
An example from [[software engineering]] is the [[encoding]] of information and data. The date and time ''"2011-07-12 07:18:47"'' can be expressed as [[Unix time]] with the 32-bit [[Signedness|signed]] [[integer]] &lt;code&gt;1310447927&lt;/code&gt;, consuming only 4 [[byte]]s. Represented as [[ISO 8601]] formatted [[UTF-8]] encoded [[String literal|string]] &lt;code&gt;2011-07-12 07:18:47&lt;/code&gt; the date would consume 19 bytes, a size overhead of 375% over the binary integer representation. As [[XML]] this date can be written as follows with an overhead of 218 characters, while adding the semantic context that it is a CHANGEDATE with index 1.
&lt;code&gt;
 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
 &lt;DATETIME qualifier="CHANGEDATE" index="1"&gt;
     &lt;YEAR&gt;2011&lt;/YEAR&gt;
     &lt;MONTH&gt;07&lt;/MONTH&gt;
     &lt;DAY&gt;12&lt;/DAY&gt;
     &lt;HOUR&gt;07&lt;/HOUR&gt;
     &lt;MINUTE&gt;18&lt;/MINUTE&gt;
     &lt;SECOND&gt;47&lt;/SECOND&gt;
 &lt;/DATETIME&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
The 349 bytes resulting from the UTF-8 encoded XML correspond to a size overhead of 8625% over the original integer representation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35281">{{Other uses|Pattern recognition (disambiguation)}}

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], '''pattern recognition''' describes a [[cognitive]] process that matches information from a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] with information [[Recall (memory)|retrieved]] from [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Eysenck&gt;Eysenck, Michael W.; Keane, Mark T. (2003). Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook (4th ed.). Hove; Philadelphia; New York: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|9780863775512}}. OCLC 894210185. Retrieved 27 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pattern recognition occurs when information from the environment is received and entered into [[short-term memory]], causing automatic activation of a specific content of [[long-term memory]]. An early example of this is learning the alphabet in order. When a carer repeats ‘A, B, C’ multiple times to a child, utilizing the pattern recognition, the child says ‘C’ after he/she hears ‘A, B’ in order. Recognizing patterns allow us to predict and expect what is coming. The process of pattern recognition involves matching the information received with the information already stored in the brain. Making the connection between memories and information perceived is a step of pattern recognition called identification. Pattern recognition requires repetition of experience. [[Semantic memory]], which is used implicitly and subconsciously is the main type of memory involved with recognition.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;Snyder, B. (2000). Music and memory: An introduction. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pattern recognition is not only crucial to humans, but to other animals as well. Even koalas, who possess less-developed thinking abilities, use pattern recognition to find and consume eucalyptus leaves. The human brain has developed more, but holds similarities to the brains of birds and lower mammals. The development of [[neural networks]] in the outer layer of the brain in humans has allowed for better processing of visual and auditory patterns. Spatial positioning in the environment, remembering findings, and detecting hazards and resources to increase chances of survival are examples of the application of pattern recognition for humans and animals.&lt;ref name=mattson&gt;Mattson, M. P. (2014). Superior pattern processing is the essence of the evolved human brain. Frontiers in neuroscience, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six main theories of pattern recognition: template matching, [[prototype-matching]], feature analysis, [[recognition-by-components theory]], bottom-up and top-down processing, and [[Fourier analysis]]. The application of these theories in everyday life is not mutually exclusive. Pattern recognition allows us to read words, understand [[language]], recognize friends, and even appreciate [[music]]. Each of the theories applies to various activities and domains where pattern recognition is observed. Facial, music and language recognition, and seriation are a few of such domains. Facial recognition and seriation occur through encoding visual patterns, while music and language recognition use the encoding of auditory patterns.

==Theories==

===Template matching===
Template matching theory describes the most basic approach to human pattern recognition. It is a theory that assumes every perceived object is stored as a "template" into long-term memory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shugen, W. (2002). Framework of pattern recognition model based on the cognitive psychology. Geo-spatial Information Science, 5(2), 74-78. https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02833890&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming information is compared to these templates to find an exact match.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gregg. (2013, May 1). Perception and perceptual illusions. Psychology Today. Retrieved from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201305/perception-and-perceptual-illusions&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, all sensory input is compared to multiple representations of an object to form one single conceptual understanding. The theory defines perception as a fundamentally recognition-based process. It assumes that everything we see, we understand only through past exposure, which then informs our future perception of the external world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Top-down and bottom-up theories of perception. (2009, June 27). Retrieved from http://cognitivepsychology.wikidot.com/cognition:topdown&lt;/ref&gt; For example, A, '''A''', and ''A'' are all recognized as the letter A, but not B. This viewpoint is limited, however, in explaining how new experiences can be understood without being compared to an internal memory template.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Y. Pi, W. Liao, M. Liu, &amp; J. Lu. (2008). Theory of cognitive pattern recognition. INTECH. Retrieved from http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5795.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prototype matching===
Unlike the exact, one-to-one, template matching theory, prototype matching instead compares incoming sensory input to one average prototype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This theory proposes that exposure to a series of related stimuli leads to the creation of a "typical" prototype based on their shared features.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It reduces the number of stored templates by standardizing them into a single representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The prototype supports perceptual flexibility, because unlike in template matching, it allows for variability in the recognition of novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For instance, if a child had never seen a lawn chair before, they would still be able to recognize it as a chair because of their understanding of its essential characteristics as having four legs and a seat. This idea, however, limits the conceptualization of objects that cannot necessarily be "averaged" into one, like types of canines, for instance. Even though dogs, wolves, and foxes are all typically furry, four-legged, moderately sized animals with ears and a tail, they are not all the same, and thus cannot be strictly perceived with respect to the prototype matching theory.

===Feature analysis===
Multiple theories try to explain how humans are able to recognize patterns in their environment. Feature detection theory proposes that the nervous system sorts and filters incoming stimuli to allow the human (or animal) to make sense of the information. In the organism, this system is made up of [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detectors]], which are individual neurons, or groups of neurons, that encode specific perceptual features. The theory proposes an increasing complexity in the relationship between detectors and the perceptual feature. The most basic feature detectors respond to simple properties of the stimuli. Further along the perceptual pathway, higher organized feature detectors are able to respond to more complex and specific stimuli properties. When features repeat or occur in a meaningful sequence, we are able to identify these patterns because of our feature detection system.

=== Multiple discrimination scaling ===
{{unclear|section|reason=it is unclear what is meant by the distance of 50%|date=August 2018}}
Template and feature analysis approaches to recognition of objects (and situations) have been merged / reconciled / overtaken by multiple discrimination theory. This states that the amounts in a test stimulus of each salient feature of a template are recognized in any perceptual judgment as being at a distance in the universal unit of 50% discrimination (the objective performance 'JND'{{clarification needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Torgerson, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;) from the amount of that feature in the template.&lt;ref&gt;Booth &amp; Freeman, 1993, Acta Psychologica&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by components theory===
[[File:Breakdown of objects into Geons.png|thumb|Image showing the breakdown of common geometric shapes (geons)]]
Similar to feature detection theory, [[Recognition-by-components theory|recognition by components]] (RBC) focuses on the bottom-up features of the stimuli being processed. First proposed by Irving Biederman (1987), this theory states that humans recognize objects by breaking them down into their basic 3D geometric shapes called geons (i.e. cylinders, cubes, cones, etc.). An example is how we break down a common item like a coffee cup: we recognize the hollow cylinder that holds the liquid and a curved handle off the side that allows us to hold it. Even though not every coffee cup is exactly the same, these basic components helps us to recognize the consistency across examples (or pattern). RBC suggests that are fewer than 36 unique geons that when combined can form a virtually unlimited number of objects. To parse and dissect an object, RBC proposes we attend to two specific features: edges and concavities. Edges enable the observer to maintain a consistent representation of the object regardless of the viewing angle and lighting conditions. Concavities are where two edges meet and enable the observer to perceive where one geon ends and another begins. 

The RBC principles of visual object recognition can be applied to auditory language recognition as well. In place of geons, language researchers propose that spoken language can be broken down into basic components called [[phoneme]]s. For example, there are 44 phonemes in the [[English language]].

===Top-down and bottom-up processing===
====Top-down processing====
Top-down processing refers to the use of background information in pattern recognition.&lt;ref name=simplepsyc &gt;McLeod, S. (2008) Visual Perception Theory. Simply Psychology. Retrieved from https://www.simplypsychology.org/perception-theories.html&lt;/ref&gt; It always begins with a person’s previous knowledge, and makes predictions due to this already acquired knowledge.&lt;ref name=PSU &gt;Wede, J. (2014, April 28). Bottom-up and Top-down Processing: A Collaborative Duality. Retrieved from: http://sites.psu.edu/psych256sp14/2014/04/28/bottom-up-and-top-down-processing-a-collaborative-duality/&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Richard Gregory estimated that about 90% of the information is lost between the time it takes to go from the eye to the brain, which is why the brain must guess what the person sees based on past experiences. In other words, we construct our perception of reality, and these perceptions are hypotheses or propositions based on past experiences and stored information. The formation of incorrect propositions will lead to errors of perception such as visual illusions.&lt;ref name="simplepsyc" /&gt; Given a paragraph written with difficult handwriting, it is easier to understand what the writer wants to convey if one reads the whole paragraph rather than reading the words in separate terms. The brain may be able to perceive and understand the gist of the paragraph due to the context supplied by the surrounding words.&lt;ref name= Sincero2013&gt;Sincero, S. M. (2013) Top-Down VS Bottom-Up Processing. Retrieved Oct 20, 2017 from Explorable.com: https://explorable.com/top-down-vs-bottom-up-processing&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bottom-up processing====
Bottom-up processing is also known as data-driven processing, because it originates with the stimulation of the sensory receptors.&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt; Psychologist James Gibson opposed the top-down model and argued that perception is direct, and not subject to hypothesis testing as Gregory proposed. He stated that sensation is perception and there is no need for extra interpretation, as there is enough information in our environment to make sense of the world in a direct way. His theory is sometimes known as the "ecological theory" because of the claim that perception can be explained solely in terms of the environment. An example of bottom up-processing involves presenting a flower at the center of a person's field. The sight of the flower and all the information about the stimulus are carried from the retina to the visual cortex in the brain. The signal travels in one direction.&lt;ref name="Sincero2013"/&gt;

==Seriation==
[[File:Seriation task w shapes.jpg|thumb|A simple seriation task involving arranging shapes by size]]
In psychologist [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of [[cognitive development]], the third stage is called the Concrete Operational State. It is during this stage that the abstract principle of thinking called "seriation" is naturally developed in a child.&lt;ref name=Kidd&gt;Kidd, J. K., Curby, T. W., Boyer, C., Gadzichowski, K., Gallington, D. A., Machado, J. A., &amp; Pasnak, R. (2012). Benefits of an intervention focused on oddity and seriation. Early Education and Development, 23(6), 900-918 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10409289.2011.621877
&lt;/ref&gt; Seriation is the ability to arrange items in a logical order along a quantitative dimension such as length, weight, age, etc.&lt;ref name=Berk2013&gt;Berk, L. E. (2013). Development through the lifespan (6th ed.). Pearson. {{ISBN|9780205957606}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a general cognitive skill which is not fully mastered until after the nursery years .&lt;ref name=Curtis2002&gt;Curtis, A. (2002). Curriculum for the pre-school child. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781134770458}}&lt;/ref&gt; To seriate means to understand that objects can be ordered along a dimension,&lt;ref name= "Kidd"/&gt; and to effectively do so, the child needs to be able to answer the question "What comes next?"&lt;ref name= "Curtis2002"/&gt; Seriation skills also help to develop problem-solving skills, which are useful in recognizing and completing patterning tasks.

===Piaget's work on seriation===
Piaget studied the development of seriation along with Szeminska in an experiment where they used rods of varying lengths to test the skill of children's skills.&lt;ref name=Inhelder1964 &gt;Inhelder, B., &amp; Piaget, J. (1964). Early growth of logic in the child; classification and seriation, aby Bärbel Inhelder and Jean Piaget. New York: Routledge and Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; They found that there were three distinct stages of development of the skill. In the first stage, children around the age of 4 could not arrange the first ten rods in order. They could make smaller groups of 2-4, but could not put all the elements together. In
the second stage where the children were 5–6 years of age, they could succeed in the seriation task with the first ten rods through the process of trial and error. They could insert the other set of rods into order through trial and error. In the third stage, the 7-8-year-old children could arrange all the rods in order without much trial and error. The children used the systematic method of first looking for the smallest rod first and the smallest among the rest.&lt;ref name="Inhelder1964" /&gt;

===Development of problem-solving skills===
To develop the skill of seriation, which then helps advance [[problem-solving]] skills, children should be provided with opportunities to arrange things in order using the appropriate language, such as "big" and "bigger" when working with size relationships. They should also be given the chance to arrange objects in order based on the texture, sound, flavor and color.&lt;ref name="Curtis2002" /&gt; Along with specific tasks of seriation, children should be given the chance to compare the different materials and toys they use during play. Through activities like these, the true understanding of characteristics of objects will develop. To aid them at a young age, the differences between the objects should be obvious.&lt;ref name="Curtis2002" /&gt; Lastly, a more complicated task of arranging two different sets of objects and seeing the relationship between the two different sets should also be provided. A common example of this is having children attempt to fit saucepan lids to saucepans of different sizes, or fitting together different sizes of nuts and bolts.&lt;ref name="Curtis2002" /&gt;

===Application of seriation in schools===
To help build up math skills in children, teachers and parents can help them learn seriation and patterning. Young children who understand seriation can put numbers in order from lowest to highest. Eventually, they will come to understand that 6 is higher than 5, and 20 is higher than 10.&lt;ref name= mathseriation&gt;Basic Math Skills in Child Care: Creating Patterns and Arranging Objects in Order. Retrieved from Extension Articles on 2017-10-20 http://articles.extension.org/pages/25597/basic-math-skills-in-child-care:-creating-patterns-and-arranging-objects-in-order&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, having children copy patterns or create patterns of their own, like ABAB patterns, is a great way to help them recognize order and prepare for later math skills, such as multiplication. Child care providers can begin exposing children to patterns at a very young age by having them make groups and count the total number of objects.&lt;ref name="mathseriation"/&gt;

==Facial pattern recognition==
Recognizing faces is one of the most common forms of pattern recognition. Humans are incredibly effective at remembering faces, but this ease and automaticity belies a very challenging problem.&lt;ref name=SciAmerican&gt;Sheikh, K. (2017) How We Save Face--Researchers Crack the Brain's Facial-Recognition Code. Scientific American. Retrieved from: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-we-save-face-researchers-crack-the-brains-facial-recognition-code/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt; All faces are physically similar. Faces have two eyes, one mouth, and one nose all in predictable locations, yet humans can recognize a face from several different angles and in various lighting conditions.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt; 

Neuroscientists posit that recognizing faces takes place in three phases. The first phase starts with visually focusing on of the physical features. The facial recognition system then needs to reconstruct the identity of the person from previous experiences. This provides us with the signal that this might be a person we know. The final phase of recognition completes when the face elicits the name of the person.&lt;ref name= BrainBlogger&gt;Wlassoff, V. (2015). How the Brain Recognizes Faces. Brain Blogger. Retrieved from: http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/17/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although humans are great at recognizing faces under normal viewing angles, upside-down faces are tremendously difficult to recognize. This demonstrates not only the challenges of facial recognition but also how humans have specialized procedures and capacities for recognizing faces under normal upright viewing conditions.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;

===Neural mechanisms===
[[File:Fusiform Face Area - animation1.gif|thumb|Brain animation highlighting the fusiform face area, thought to be where facial processing and recognition takes place]]
Scientists agree that there is a certain area in the brain specifically devoted to processing faces. This structure is called the [[fusiform gyrus]], and brain imaging studies have shown that it becomes highly active when a subject is viewing a face.&lt;ref name=SciMag&gt;Norton, E. (2012). Identifying the Brain's own Facial Recognition System. Science Magazine. Retrieved from: http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/10/identifying-brains-own-facial-recognition-system&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several case studies have reported that patients with lesions or tissue damage localized to this area have tremendous difficulty recognizing faces, even their own. Although most of this research is circumstantial, a study at Stanford University provided conclusive evidence for the fusiform gyrus' role in facial recognition. In a unique case study, researchers were able to send direct signals to a patient's fusiform gyrus. The patient reported that the faces of the doctors and nurses changed and morphed in front of him during this electrical stimulation. Researchers agree this demonstrates a convincing causal link between this neural structure and the human ability to recognize faces.&lt;ref name="SciMag" /&gt;

===Facial recognition development===
Although in adults, facial recognition is fast and automatic, children do not reach adult levels of performance (in laboratory tasks) until adolescence.&lt;ref name=Article&gt;McKone, E., et al. (2012). A critical review of the development of face recognition: Experience is less important than previously believed. Cognitive Neuropsychology. doi 10.1080/02643294.2012.660138&lt;/ref&gt; Two general theories have been put forth to explain how facial recognition normally develops. The first, general cognitive development theory, proposes that the perceptual ability to encode faces is fully developed early in childhood, and that the continued improvement of facial recognition into adulthood is attributed to other general factors. These general factors include improved attentional focus, deliberate task strategies, and metacognition. Research supports the argument that these other general factors improve dramatically into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Article" /&gt; Face-specific perceptual development theory argues that the improved facial recognition between children and adults is due to a precise development of facial perception. The cause for this continuing development is proposed to be an ongoing experience with faces.

===Developmental issues===
Several developmental issues manifest as a decreased capacity for facial recognition. Using what is known about the role of the fusiform gyrus, research has shown that impaired social development along the [[autism spectrum]] is accompanied by a behavioral marker where these individuals tend to look away from faces, and a neurological marker characterized by decreased neural activity in the [[fusiform gyrus]].  Similarly, those with developmental [[prosopagnosia]] (DP) struggle with facial recognition to the extent they are often unable to identify even their own faces. Many studies report that around 2% of the world’s population have developmental prosopagnosia, and that individuals with DP have a family history of the trait.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;Duchaine, B. (2015). Individual differences in face recognition ability: Impacts on law enforcement, criminal justice and national security. APA: Psychological Science Agenda. Retrieved from:
 http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2015/06/face-recognition.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with DP are behaviorally indistinguishable from those with physical damage or lesions on the fusiform gyrus, again implicating its importance to facial recognition. Despite those with DP or neurological damage, there remains a large variability in facial recognition ability in the total population.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt; It is unknown what accounts for the differences in facial recognition ability, whether it is a biological or environmental disposition. Recent research analyzing identical and fraternal [[twins]] showed that facial recognition was significantly higher correlated in identical twins, suggesting a strong genetic component to individual differences in facial recognition ability.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;

==Language development==

===Pattern recognition in language acquisition===
Recent{{when|date=May 2018}} research reveals that infant [[language acquisition]] is linked to cognitive pattern recognition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Language ability linked to pattern recognition. (2013, May 29). VOA. Retrieved October 25, 2017 from https://www.voanews.com/a/language-ability-linked-to-pattern-recognition/1670776.html&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike classical [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] theories of [[language development]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Kuhl, P.

Retrieved October 25, 2017 from http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160505222938.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Children with high shape recognition showed better grammar knowledge, even when controlling for the effects of [[intelligence]] and [[memory]] capacity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is supported by the theory that language learning is based on [[Statistical learning in language acquisition|statistical learning]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the process by which infants perceive common combinations of sounds and words in language and use them to inform future speech production.

===Phonological development===
The first step in infant language acquisition is to decipher between the most basic sound units of their native language. This includes every consonant, every short and long vowel sound, and any additional letter combinations like "th" and "ph" in English. These units, called [[phonemes]], are detected through exposure and pattern recognition. Infants use their "innate [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detector]]" capabilities to distinguish between the sounds of words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They split them into phonemes through a mechanism of [[categorical perception]]. Then they extract statistical information by recognizing which combinations of sounds are most likely to occur together,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; like "qu" or "h" plus a vowel. In this way, their ability to learn words is based directly on the accuracy of their earlier phonetic patterning.

===Grammar development===
The transition from phonemic differentiation into higher-order word production&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; is only the first step in the hierarchical acquisition of language. Pattern recognition is furthermore utilized in the detection of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] cues, the stress and intonation patterns among words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Then it is applied to sentence structure and the understanding of typical [[clause]] boundaries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This entire process is reflected in reading as well. First, a child recognizes patterns of individual letters, then words, then groups of words together, then paragraphs, and finally entire chapters in books.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Basulto, D. (2013, July 24). Humans are the world’s best pattern-recognition machines, but for how long? Retrieved October 25, 2017 from http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/humans-are-the-worlds-best-pattern-recognition-machines-but-for-how-long&lt;/ref&gt; Learning to read and learning to speak a language are based on the "stepwise refinement of patterns"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; in perceptual pattern recognition.

==Music pattern recognition==
[[Music]] provides deep and emotional experiences for the listener.&lt;ref name=lehrer&gt;Lehrer, Jonah. “The Neuroscience Of Music.” Wired, Conde Nast, 3 June 2017, www.wired.com/2011/01/the-neuroscience-of-music/.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences become contents in [[long-term memory]], and every time we hear the same tunes, those contents are activated. Recognizing the content by the pattern of the music affects our emotion. The mechanism that forms the pattern recognition of music and the experience has been studied by multiple researchers. The sensation felt when listening to our favorite music is evident by the dilation of the pupils, the increase in pulse and blood pressure, the streaming of blood to the leg muscles, and the activation of the [[cerebellum]], the brain region associated with physical movement.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; 
While retrieving the [[memory]] of a tune demonstrates general recognition of musical pattern, pattern recognition also occurs while listening to a tune for the first time. The recurring nature of the [[metre]] allows the listener to follow a tune, recognize the metre, expect its upcoming occurrence, and figure the [[rhythm]]. The excitement of following a familiar music pattern happens when the pattern breaks and becomes unpredictable. This following and breaking of a pattern creates a problem-solving opportunity for the mind that form the experience.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; Psychologist Daniel Levitin argues that the repetitions, melodic nature and organization of this music create meaning for the brain.&lt;ref name=levitin&gt;Levitin, D. J. (2006). This is your brain on music: The science of a human obsession. Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The brain stores information in an arrangement of [[neuron]]s which retrieve the same information when activated by the environment. By constantly referencing information and additional stimulation from the environment, the brain constructs musical features into a perceptual whole.&lt;ref name="levitin" /&gt; 

The medial [[prefrontal cortex]] – one of the last areas affected by [[Alzheimer’s disease]] – is the region activated by music.

===Cognitive mechanisms===
To understand music pattern recognition, we need to understand the underlying cognitive systems that each handle a part of this process. Various activities are at work in this recognition of a piece of music and its patterns. Researchers have begun to unveil the reasons behind the stimulated reactions to music. Montreal-based researchers asked ten volunteers who got "chills" listening to music to listen to their favorite songs while their brain activity was being monitored.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; The results show the significant role of the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc) region – involved with cognitive processes such as motivation, reward, addiction, etc. – creating the neural arrangements that make up the experience.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; A sense of reward prediction is created by anticipation before the climax of the tune, which comes to a sense of resolution when the climax is reached. The longer the listener is denied the expected pattern, the greater the emotional arousal when the pattern returns. Musicologist Leonard Meyer used fifty measures of [[Beethoven]]’s 5th movement of the String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131 to examine this notion.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; The stronger this experience is, the more vivid memory it will create and store. This strength affects the speed and accuracy of retrieval and recognition of the musical pattern. The brain not only recognizes specific tunes, it distinguishes standard acoustic features, speech and music. 

MIT researchers conducted a study to examine this notion.&lt;ref name=bushak&gt;Bushak, L. (2017). This Is Your Brain On Music: How Our Brains Process Melodies That Pull On Our Heartstrings. [online] Medical Daily. Available at: http://www.medicaldaily.com/your-brain-music-how-our-brains-process-melodies-pull-our-heartstrings-271007 [Accessed 26 Oct. 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed six neural clusters in the [[auditory cortex]] responding to the sounds. Four were triggered when hearing standard acoustic features, one specifically responded to speech, and the last exclusively responded to music. Researchers who studied the correlation between temporal evolution of timbral, tonal and rhythmic features of music, came to the conclusion that music engages the brain regions connected to motor actions, emotions and creativity. The research indicates that the whole brain "lights up" when listening to music.&lt;ref name=bergland&gt;Bergland, C. (2013, December 11). Why Do the Songs from Your Past Evoke Such Vivid Memories? Retrieved from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201312/why-do-the-songs-your-past-evoke-such-vivid-memories&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of activity boosts memory preservation, hence pattern recognition. 

Recognizing patterns of music is different for a musician and a listener. Although a musician may play the same notes every time, the details of the frequency will always be different. The listener will recognize the musical pattern and their types despite the variations. These musical types are conceptual and learned, meaning they might vary culturally.&lt;ref name=agus&gt;Agus, T. R., Thorpe, S. J., &amp; Pressnitzer, D. (2010). Rapid formation of robust auditory memories: insights from noise. Neuron, 66(4), 610-618.&lt;/ref&gt; While listeners are involved with recognizing (implicit) musical material, musicians are involved with recalling them (explicit).&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt; 

A UCLA study found that when watching or hearing music being played, neurons associated with the muscles needed for playing the instrument fire. [[Mirror neurons]] light up when musicians and non-musicians listen to a piece.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;Byrne, D. (2012, October). How Do Our Brains Process Music? Retrieved from https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-do-our-brains-process-music-32150302/?no-ist=&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental issues===
Pattern recognition of music can build and strengthen other skills, such as musical synchrony and attentional performance and musical notation and brain engagement. Even a few years of musical training enhances memory and attention levels. Scientists at University of Newcastle conducted a study on patients with severe [[acquired brain injuries]] (ABIs) and healthy participants, using popular music to examine music-evoked [[autobiographical memories]] (MEAMs).&lt;ref name="bergland" /&gt; The participants were asked to record their familiarity with the songs, whether they liked them and what memories they evoked. The results showed that the ABI patients had the highest MEAMs, and all the participants had MEAMs of a person, people or life period that were generally positive.&lt;ref name="bergland" /&gt; The participants completed the task by utilizing pattern recognition skills. Memory evocation caused the songs to sound more familiar and well-liked. This research can be beneficial to rehabilitating patients of autobiographical amnesia who do not have fundamental deficiency in autobiographical recall memory and intact pitch perception.&lt;ref name="bergland" /&gt; 

In a study at University of California, Davis mapped the brain of participants while they listened to music.&lt;ref name=greensfelder&gt;Greensfelder, L. (2009, February). Study Finds Brain Hub that Links Music, Memory and Emotion. Retrieved from https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/study-finds-brain-hub-links-music-memory-and-emotion&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed links between brain regions to [[autobiographical memories]] and emotions activated by familiar music. This study can explain the strong response of patients with Alzheimer’s disease to music. This research can help such patients with pattern recognition-enhancing tasks.

==False pattern recognition==
{{Main|Apophenia}}
[[File:SharkOrSubmarine4024617900.jpg|thumb|[[Whale]], [[submarine]] or [[sheep]]?]]
The human tendency to see patterns that do not actually exist is called [[apophenia]]. Examples include the Man in the Moon, faces or figures in shadows, in clouds, and in patterns with no deliberate design, such as the swirls on a baked confection, and the perception of causal [[synchronicity|relationships between events]] which are, in fact, unrelated.  Apophenia figures prominently in [[conspiracy theories]], [[gambling]], misinterpretation of [[statistics]] and [[scientific]] data, and some kinds of [[religion|religious]] and [[paranormal]] experiences.  Misperception of patterns in random data is called [[pareidolia]].

[[Nilli Lavie]] presented the '''perceptual load theory''' in the mid-nineties as a potential resolution to the early/late selection debate.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Tsal|first2=Yehoshua|title=Perceptual load as a major determinant of the locus of selection in visual attention|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=1994|volume=56|issue=2|pages=183–197|url=http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/Lavie%20&amp;%20Tsal_1994.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.3758/bf03213897}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= two&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|title=Perceptual load as a necessary condition for selective attention|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1995|volume=21|issue=3|pages=451–468|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fb33/666f554fca9ef4b0da105dc493a9c70edbe0.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.3.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate can be summated through two questions, firstly; when in the information processing stream does attention select target information? Secondly; to what degree do distractor stimuli get processed? Prior to Lavie’s theory there were several other suggestions as to how targets are perceived amongst distractor stimuli.

Researcher’s such as Donald Broadbent &lt;ref name= three&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broadbent|first1=Donald. E|title=Perception and Communication|date=1958|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that selection occurs during the early stages of processing by suggesting that information has to go through a sensory filter, and as that filter has a limited capacity all information that is not directly attended to will decay. Whilst researchers such as Deutsch and Deutsch argued that this filtering &lt;ref name= four&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=J. A.|last2=Deutsch|first2=D|title=Attention: some theoretical considerations|journal=Psychological Review|date=Jan 1963|volume=70|issue=1|pages=80–90|doi=10.1037/h0039515}}&lt;/ref&gt; of irrelevant stimuli occurs in the late stages of processing, in that, all of the information is processed on a sensory level but just before the level of working memory the semantic content of the message is the filter. 
Lavie attempts to resolve this debate by stating that both early and late selection occur varying on the stimulus presented.

From the perspective of perceptual load theory stimulus variation means whether the stimulus has high or low perceptual load. Perceptual load refers to the complexity of the physical stimuli, particularly the distractor stimuli e.g. a square surrounded by circles is a scene with low perceptual load whereas a square surrounded by lots of different shapes has high perceptual load. Due to the assumed limited capacity of attentional resources and that distractors have to be processed before the target it is suggested that, in high load tasks the targets attentional resources are depleted faster therefore being able to attend to the target sooner compared to a low load task. This is because the low load task needs to process more of the distractors to exhaust mental resources, therefore the distractors cause a greater inference in finding the target. This demonstrates that selection occurs both in the early stages of processing (high load condition) when the degree of inference is low as the majority of the resources process the target and enables the individual to ignore distractors. As well as the late stages (low load condition) when the distractors are perceived because they take up fewer attentional resources and as such spill over to the distractors which results in them being perceived, causing an interference.&lt;ref name= five&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartwright-finch|first1=Ula|last2=Lavie|first2=Nilli|title=The role of perceptual load in inattentional blindness|journal=Cognition|date=2007|volume=102|issue=3|pages=321–340|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.01.002|pmid=16480973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= six&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie|first1=Nilli|last2=Hirst|first2=A|last3=de Fockhert|first3=J.

==Key assumptions==

Perceptual load theory makes three main assumptions, these are;&lt;ref name= one /&gt;&lt;ref name= two /&gt;

# Attentional resources are limited in capacity.
# Task-relevant stimuli are processed before task-irrelevant stimuli. 
# That all of the attentional resources have to be used up.

Therefore, if the task-relevant stimulus uses all of the attentional resources then none of the task-irrelevant stimuli (distractors) will be processed.

==Criticisms==

In spite of the collection of research that has accumulated over the 90’s and early 2000’s there has been a counter argument posited by Lavie’s PhD supervisor, Tsal Yehoshua. However, it should be noted that in spite of the relevance of Tsal’s critique some of the first critiques to the perceptual load theory pointed out how a visual cue can eliminate the inference effect supposedly created by perceptual load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D. N.|last2=McGrath|first2=A.|last3=McNeil|first3=C.|title=Cuing interacts with perceptual load in visual search|journal=Psychological Science|date=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=284–287|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00452|pmid=12009052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paquet|first1=L|last2=Craig|first2=G. L|title=Evidence for selective target processing with a low perceptual load flankers task|journal=Cognition|date=1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=182–189|doi=10.3758/bf03201111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution Effects===

Primarily; the critique that Tsal makes is that perceptual load theory is not a solution to the early selection versus late selection debate but rather is purely an early selection model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benoni|first1=H|last2=Tsal|first2=Y|title=Conceptual and methodological concerns in the theory of perceptual load|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2013|volume=4|page=522|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00522|pmid=23964262|pmc=3741554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggested reason that causes the inference rates to change between simple versus complex displays is dilution not load.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsal|first1=Y|last2=Benoni|first2=H|title=Where have we gone wrong? Perceptual load does not affect selective attention|journal=Vision Research|date=2010|volume=50|issue=13|pages=1292–1298|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.04.018|pmid=20430048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that the high load condition has lower inference because the higher number/more complex distractors, not because of perceptual load. This was tested in a series of experiments &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; which took the classic perceptual load experiments &lt;ref name= one /&gt; and added a new condition, the dilution condition. The way this condition varied is that it makes the distractors in the task the same colour, and making that colour differ from the target letter. This creates a condition that is low in load, and high in dilution and thus isolates dilution as a variable. The result of this manipulation was not that of a higher inference rate in low perceptual load conditions comparative to high as seen in the original perceptual load experiments. Rather that inference levels were significantly lower in the low load and dilution conditions compared to the high load.

===Distractor Salience===

Another proposed theory to explain results attained by Lavie’s original experiments is that of distractor salience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eltiti|first1=Stacy|last2=Wallace|first2=Denise|last3=Fox|first3=Elaine|title=Selective target processing: Perceptual load or distractor salience?|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|date=2005|volume=67|issue=5|pages=876–885|doi=10.3758/bf03193540}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests this theory concerns the salience, or prominence, of a distractor as being the primary factor in inducing these results instead of load. By manipulating the onset versus offset of the distractor, research displayed the effect of salience on selective information. In this research onset and offset differed in terms of when the distractor was presented, either simultaneously with the singleton search task (onset) or having it appear with a fixation point before the task (offset). This resulted in an inference effect on reaction times when searching for the target in the onset condition regardless of whether the trial was a high load trial or a low load trial. This demonstrates that the effect seen in Lavie’s work &lt;ref name= one /&gt; is not as a result of load manipulation, but of distractor salience.

===Methodological Issues===

There are also some crucial methodological issues with perceptual load theory research pertaining to experimental design.&lt;ref name= two /&gt;&lt;ref name= five /&gt;&lt;ref name= six /&gt;&lt;ref name= seven /&gt;&lt;ref name= eight /&gt; Specifically, the use of a blocked design compared to a mixed design in the experiments. In this case, blocked experimental design is when all of the trials with either low or high perceptual load are carried out sequentially within a block of trials. Whereas, a mixed experimental design has combination of both low and high perceptual load trials that are randomly intermixed within a block of trials. The issue with using a blocked design is that the repetition of the same experimental condition can allow for attention to be localised in one particular spot. Research has shown that when conducting a perceptual load task under a mixed design there is no significant difference in interference between low load and high load conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Janice E|last2=Jones|first2=Craig|title=Attention to local form information can prevent access to semantic information|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=2010|volume=55|issue=2|pages=609–625|doi=10.1080/02724980143000370|pmid=12047062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, suggesting that when the trials are blocked it is not perceptual load that causes the difference in interference rather how localised the participants field of attention was. This has since been expanded and developed by &lt;ref name= nineteen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Perceptual load vs. dilution: the roles of attentional focus, stimulus category, and target predictability|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=June 2013|volume=4|pages=1–14|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00327|pmid=23761777|pmc=3675768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhe|last2=Cave|first2=Kyle R|title=Identifying Visual Targets Amongst Interfering Distractors: Sorting Out the Roles of Perceptual Load, Dilution, and Attentional Zoom|journal=Attention, Pereception, and Psychophsics|date=2016|volume=78|issue=7|pages=1822–38|doi=10.3758/s13414-016-1149-9|pmid=27250363}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be coined as ‘Attentional Zoom’.

===Attentional Zoom===

As previously discussed attentional zoom was coined by researchers Zhe Chen and Kyle Cave as an alternative explanation to the results seen in perceptual load theory. The pair also critique other attempts into understanding the data presented by perceptual load theory, such as dilution.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Attentional zoom theory states that participants can process distractors when they are within their attentional focus. So when an individual is induced to have a small attentional focus and the distractors fall outside of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eriksen|first1=Charles W|last2=St James|first2=J.

This can be demonstrated as separate from dilution as in &lt;ref name= nineteen /&gt; dilution through luminance decrease had no effect on distractor processing whilst being cued as to whether a target would appear in either one of two locations or one of six did. According to dilution theory the two trials should be show similar levels of inference regardless of cueing, however, what this experiment reveals is that when cued for two locations the attentional focus of the participants narrowed, thus reducing the effect of the distractor as it was outside the attentional view. Whereas, when the target was cued for six the attentional focus was forced to widen and as such the distractor could be processed causing an inference effect.

The '''physical attractiveness stereotype''' is a tendency, described by [[psychology|psychologists]], to assume that people who are [[physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] also possess other socially desirable personality traits. [[Stereotype|Stereotyping]] is the process by which we draw inferences about others based on knowledge of the categories to which they belong.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel.L. (2012) Psychology (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

(Dion et al., 1972; Miller, 1970) Studies have found that [[Western world|Western]] people are more willing to listen to and believe people who are judged, by conventional standards, to be aesthetically attractive.

In less-[[individualistic]] [[culture]]s, beautiful people are assumed to have traits that those cultures value, such as concern for others, loyalty and integrity. (Dion et al., 1972) Regarding the perception of beauty in [[Eastern world|the East]], Wheeler and Kim (1997) found that university students in Korea saw beautiful people as more trustworthy and concerned for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = L. | last2 = Kim | first2 = Y. | year = 1997 | title = What is beautiful is culturally good: The physical attractiveness stereotype has different content in collectivist cultures | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 795–800 | doi=10.1177/0146167297238001}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they did not share the North American university students' bias towards perceiving beautiful people as more self-assertive and dominant than less attractive people. This can be seen in myths and fairy tales as well as films throughout history: the 'goodies' are young and beautiful, whereas the 'baddies' are ugly. Previous studies have found a recognition bias for information consistent with the [[physical attractiveness]] stereotype (Rohner, J.‐C., 2012).

The stereotype acts as a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the perception of attractive people as more valuable members of society leads to their receiving preferential treatment, positive [[feedback]] and tangible benefit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Studies{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} have found that attractiveness does correlate positively with some traits such as personal [[income]], [[social skills]] and [[self-confidence]]. This [[cognitive bias]] could be considered to be a specific kind of [[halo effect]].

Physical attractiveness can have a significant effect on how people are judged in terms of employment or social opportunities, friendship, sexual behavior, and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Kate. (2005). "[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/07/08/looks/ Do Pretty People Earn More?]" http://www.CNN.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, humans attribute positive characteristics, such as intelligence and honesty, to attractive people without consciously realizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dion | first1 = K. | authorlink2 = Ellen S. Berscheid | last2 = Berscheid | first2 = E. | last3 = Walster | first3 = E. | year = 1972 | title = What is beautiful is good | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 285–290 | doi=10.1037/h0033731 | pmid=4655540}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically attractive individuals are regarded more positively and accurately in first impressions, however the physical attractiveness stereotype will have bias opinions and decisions when comparing people of different attractiveness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorenzo|first1=G. L.|last2=Biesanz|first2=J. C.|last3=Human|first3=L. J.|title=What Is Beautiful Is Good and More Accurately Understood: Physical Attractiveness and Accuracy in First Impressions of Personality|journal=Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|issue=12|pages=1777–1782|doi=10.1177/0956797610388048|url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LorenzoBiesanzHumanFinal.pdf|pmid=21051521|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323071649/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LorenzoBiesanzHumanFinal.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Pfeifer noted a positive correlation between physical appearance and wages. More attractive people are, on average, more likely to be employed and have a higher wage than their normal counterpart. According to this study, the estimated effects of the interviewer rating, generally, have a larger impact on men than for on women, while self-ratings (of attractiveness) have a larger effect on women than on men. However, in this study, the rating from others (in this case, the interviewer) have a larger effect than self-rating. "The wage effects of attractiveness are nonlinear for men, which implies that wage punishment for unattractiveness is larger than wage premium for attractiveness, and linear for women."

Studies show that teachers perceive attractive children as more intellectual, more engaged in school and more likely to succeed academically than unattractive children. This is because teachers have been shown to have more positive interactions with attractive children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrnes|first1=D. A.|title=Overcoming student stereotypes about physical attractiveness|journal=The Education Digest|date=1988|volume=53|issue=9|pages=32-32|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/18831627/overcoming-student-stereotypes-about-physical-attractiveness|ISSN=0013-127X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition other studies show that customers' perceptions of quality of service is boosted by physical attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luoh|first1=Hsiang-Fei|last2=Tsaur|first2=Sheng-Hshiung|title=Physical attractiveness stereotypes and service quality in customer–server encounters|journal=The Service Industries Journal|date=2009|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1093–1104|doi=10.1080/02642060902764517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain instances, physical attractiveness is distinct from sexual attraction; humans may regard the young as attractive for various reasons, for example, but without sexual attraction.

Women, on average, tend to be attracted to men who are slightly taller and who have a relatively narrow waist and broad shoulders. Men, overall, tend to be attracted by women who are slightly shorter, have a youthful appearance and exhibit features such as a symmetrical face, full breasts, full lips, and a low waist-hip ratio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2190461.stm Tall men 'top husband stakes'. (2002). BBC News]. Retrieved 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nettle2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nettle|first1=D.|title=Women's height, reproductive success and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in modern humans|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2002|volume=269|issue=1503|pages=1919–1923|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2111|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/procroysoc.pdf|pmid=12350254|pmc=1691114|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310222110/https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/procroysoc.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, physical attraction is dependent on three factors: universal perceptions common to all human [[culture]]s, cultural and [[society|social]] aspects, and individual subjective preferences. Despite universally held perceptions of beauty in both [[sex]]es, males tend to place significantly higher value on physical appearance in a partner than women do.&lt;ref name=BussBook&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=David |title=The Evolution of Desire|origyear=1994|type=hardcover |edition=second |year=2003|publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |pages=57, 58, 60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws6nov03&gt;{{cite news

==Beauty premium phenomenon==
Studies show that a better physical appearance contributes to the belief of a person being better, smarter, more successful, more important, and more valuable:

* The scores of those physically attractive are higher than less physically attractive people on measures of [[affect (psychology)|affect]]  and mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Umberson|first1=D.|last2=Hughes|first2=M.|title=The impact of physical attractiveness and achievement and psychological well-being|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=1987|volume=50|issue=3|pages=227–236|doi=10.2307/2786823|jstor=2786823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* People pay more attention to physically attractive strangers than to unattractive strangers of either sex.

==Disadvantages==
Reactions to beauty may lead to interpersonal tension and conflict. For example, people may attribute greater negative and egocentric traits to them due to jealousy.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 1984"/&gt; Extremely attractive individuals may be refused by their own sex type who are jealous of them.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hatfield, S. Sprecher, (1986). Mirror, mirror…The importance of looks in everyday life.

The '''regress argument''' (also known as the '''''diallelus'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], 
{{Google books|id=pqez0V0w1MUC|title=Epistemology: An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]]) or '''''diallelon''''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''di allelon'' "through or by means of one another") is a problem in [[epistemology]] and, in general, a problem in any situation where a statement has to be justified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoryofknowledge.info/foundationalism.html Theory of Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/Foundationalism.htm University of Reading]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to this [[argument]], any [[proposition]] requires a [[Theory of justification|justification]].  However, any justification itself requires support.  This means that any proposition whatsoever can be endlessly (infinitely) questioned.

==Origin==

The argument is usually attributed to [[Sextus Empiricus]], and has been restated by Agrippa as part of what has become known as "[[Agrippa's trilemma]]". The argument can be seen as a response to the suggestion in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' that knowledge is justified true belief.

==Structure==
Assuming that knowledge is justified true belief, then:
# Suppose that P is some piece of knowledge. Then P is a ''justified'' true belief.
# The only thing that can justify P is another statement &amp;ndash; let's call it P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; so P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; justifies P.
# But if P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is to be a satisfactory justification for P, then we must ''know'' that P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. 
# But for P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be known, it must also be a ''justified'' true belief.
# ''That'' justification will be another statement - let's call it P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; justifies P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# But if P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is to be a satisfactory justification for P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then we must ''know'' that P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is true
# But for P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to count as knowledge, it must itself be a ''justified'' true belief.
# ''That'' justification will in turn be another statement - let's call it P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; so P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; justifies P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# and so on, ''[[ad infinitum]]''.

== Responses ==
Throughout philosophic history many responses to this problem have been generated. Here, however, we present the major counter-arguments: some statements do not need justification, the chain of reasoning loops back on itself, the sequence never finishes, belief cannot be justified as beyond doubt.

===Foundationalism===

Perhaps the chain begins with a belief that is justified, but which is not justified by another belief.  Such beliefs are called [[basic belief]]s.  In this solution, which is called [[foundationalism]], all beliefs are justified by basic beliefs. Foundationalism seeks to escape the regress argument by claiming that there are some beliefs for which it is improper to ask for a justification. (See also ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.) This would be a claim that some things (basic beliefs) are true in and of themselves.

Foundationalism is the belief that a chain of justification begins with a belief that is justified, but which is not justified by another belief.  Thus, a belief is justified [[if and only if]]:
# it is a basic/foundational belief, or 
# it is justified by a basic belief
# it is justified by a chain of beliefs that is ultimately justified by a basic belief or beliefs.

Foundationalism can be compared to a building.  Ordinary individual beliefs occupy the upper stories of the building; basic, or foundational beliefs are down in the basement, in the foundation of the building, holding everything else up.   In a similar way, individual beliefs, say about economics or ethics, rest on more basic beliefs, say about the nature of human beings; and those rest on still more basic beliefs, say about the mind; and in the end the entire system rests on a set of basic beliefs which are not justified by other beliefs.

===Coherentism===
Alternatively, the chain of reasoning may loop around on itself, forming a circle.  In this case, the justification of any statement is used, perhaps after a long chain of reasoning,  in justifying itself, and the argument is [[circular argument|circular]].  This is a version of [[coherentism]].

Coherentism is the belief that an idea is justified [[if and only if]] it is part of a coherent system of mutually supporting beliefs (i.e., beliefs that support each other).  In effect Coherentism denies that justification can only take the form of a chain.  Coherentism replaces the chain with a holistic web.

The most common objection to naïve Coherentism is that it relies on the idea that circular justification is acceptable.  In this view, P ultimately supports P, [[begging the question]].  Coherentists reply that it is not just P that is supporting P, but P along with the totality of the other statements in the whole system of belief.

Coherentism  accepts any belief that is part of a coherent system of beliefs.  In contrast, P can cohere with P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without P, P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being true.  Instead, Coherentists might say that it is very unlikely that the whole system would be both untrue and consistent, and that if some part of the system was untrue, it would almost certainly be inconsistent with some other part of the system.

A third objection is that some beliefs arise from experience and not from other beliefs.  An example is that one is looking into a room which is totally dark.  The lights turn on momentarily and one sees a white canopy bed in the room.  The belief that there is a white canopy bed in this room is based entirely on experience and not on any other belief.  Of course other possibilities exist, such as that the white canopy bed is entirely an illusion or that one is hallucinating, but the belief remains well-justified.  Coherentists might respond that the belief which supports the belief that there is a white canopy bed in this room is that one saw the bed, however briefly.  This appears to be an immediate qualifier which does not depend on other beliefs, and thus seems to prove that Coherentism is not true because beliefs can be justified by concepts other than beliefs.  But others have argued  that the experience of seeing the bed is indeed dependent on other beliefs, about what a bed, a canopy and so on, actually look like.

Another objection is that the rule demanding "coherence" in a system of ideas seems to be an unjustified belief.

===Infinitism===
[[Infinitism]] argues that the chain can go on forever. Critics argue that this means there is never adequate justification for any statement in the chain.

===Skepticism===

[[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptics]] reject the three above responses and argue that beliefs cannot be justified as beyond doubt. Note that many skeptics do not deny that things may appear in a certain way. However, such sense impressions cannot, in the skeptical view, be used to find beliefs that cannot be doubted. Also, skeptics do not deny that, for example, many laws of nature give the appearance of working or that doing certain things give the appearance of producing pleasure/pain or even that reason and logic seem to be useful tools. Skepticism is in this view valuable since it encourages continued investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/ skepticism] on ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesized approaches ==

===Common sense===

The method of common sense espoused by such philosophers as [[Thomas Reid]] and [[G. E. Moore]] points out that whenever we investigate anything at all, whenever we start thinking about some subject, we have to make assumptions.  When one tries to support one's assumptions with reasons, one must make yet more assumptions.  Since it is inevitable that we will make some assumptions, why not assume those things that are most obvious: the matters of common sense that no one ever seriously doubts.

"Common sense" here does not mean old adages like "Chicken soup is good for colds" but statements about the background in which our experiences occur.  Examples would be "Human beings typically have two eyes, two ears, two hands, two feet", or "The world has a ground and a sky" or "Plants and animals come in a wide variety of sizes and colors" or  "I am [[Consciousness|conscious]] and alive right now".  These are all the absolutely most obvious sorts of claims that one could possibly make; and, said Reid and Moore, these are the claims that make up ''common sense''.

This view can be seen as either a version of foundationalism, with common sense statements taking the role of basic statements, or as a version of Coherentism.  In this case, commonsense statements are statements that are so crucial to keeping the account coherent that they are all but impossible to deny.

If the method of common sense is correct, then philosophers may take the principles of common sense for granted.  They do not need criteria in order to judge whether a proposition is true or not. They can also take some justifications for granted, according to common sense.  They can get around Sextus' problem of the criterion because there is no [[infinite regress]] or circle of reasoning, because the principles of common sense ground the entire chain of reasoning.

===Critical philosophy===

Another escape from the diallelus is [[critical philosophy]], which denies that beliefs should ever be ''justified'' at all.  Rather, the job of philosophers is to subject all beliefs (including beliefs about truth criteria) to ''criticism'', attempting to discredit them rather than justifying them.  Then, these philosophers say, it is rational to act on those beliefs that have best withstood criticism, whether or not they meet any specific criterion of truth.  [[Karl Popper]] expanded on this idea to include a ''quantitative'' measurement he called '''verisimilitude''', or truth-likeness.  He showed that even if one could never justify a particular claim, one ''can'' compare the verisimilitude of two competing claims by criticism to judge which is superior to the other.

===Pragmatism===

The [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[William James]] suggests that, ultimately, everyone settles at some level of explanation based on one's personal preferences that fit the particular individual's psychological needs.  People select whatever level of explanation fits their needs, and things other than logic and reason determine those needs.  In ''The Sentiment of Rationality'', James compares the philosopher, who insists on a high degree of justification, and the boor, who accepts or rejects ideals without much thought:

{{blockquote|The philosopher's logical tranquillity is thus in essence no other than the boor's.  They differ only as to the point at which each refuses to let further considerations upset the absoluteness of the data he assumes.}}

[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|360px|''Satya'' is an important concept and [[virtue]] in Indian religions. [[Rigveda]], dated to be from the 2nd millennium BC, offers the earliest discussion of ''Satya''.&lt;ref name=rohin/&gt;&lt;ref name=atdn/&gt; It can be seen, for example, in the fifth and sixth lines, in above Rigveda manuscript image.]]

Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen et al (2003), Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Thomson Gale, {{ISBN|0-02-865704-7}}, page 405&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to a virtue in [[Indian religions]], referring to being truthful in one's thought, speech and action.&lt;ref name=knt/&gt; In Yoga, ''satya'' is one of five [[yamas]], the virtuous restraint from falsehood and distortion of reality in one's expressions and actions.&lt;ref name=grg&gt;GR Garg, Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Volume 3, {{ISBN|81-7022-3733}}, page 733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[Vedas]] and later [[sutra]]s, the meaning of the word satya ({{linktext|सत्य}}) evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered an important virtue.&lt;ref name=knt&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; It means being true and consistent with reality in one's thought, speech and action.&lt;ref name=knt/&gt;

A related concept, [[sattva]], also derived from "sat", means true essence, nature, spiritual essence, character.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Sattva, {{oclc|492970792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sattva is also a [[guṇa]], a psychology concept particularly in the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy, where it means goodness, purity, clean, positive, one that advances good true nature of self.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [https://archive.org/stream/indianwisdomwith00moniuoft#page/94/mode/2up Indian Wisdom], Luzac &amp; Co London, page 94-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere (1977),'' The theory and practice of psychological medicine in the Ayurvedic tradition'', Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, Volume 1, Issue 2, pp 155-181&lt;/ref&gt;

Satya has [[cognates]] in a number of diverse [[Indo-European languages]], including the word "sooth" in [[English language|English]], "istina" ("истина") in [[Russian language|Russian]], "sannhet" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and "haithya" in [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the [[liturgical language]] of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref name="prudentia"&gt;{{Citation | title= Prudentia, Volumes 11-13 | author=  Dept. of Classics and Ancient History, University of Auckland | publisher= University of Auckland Bindery, 1979 | isbn=  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S70RAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=satya | quote= ...

===Vedic literature===
{{Main|Historical Vedic religion}}
''Satya'' is a central theme in the Vedas. It is equated with and considered necessary to the concept [[Ṛta]] (Sanskrit ऋतं ṛtaṃ) – that which is properly joined, order, rule, nature, balance, harmony.&lt;ref name=rohin&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}, pages 51-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Beversluis, Sourcebook of the World's Religions, New World Library, {{ISBN|978-1577311218}}, pages 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; Ṛta results from Satya in the Vedas, states Holdrege,&lt;ref name=bahold/&gt; as it regulates and enables the operation of the universe and everything within it. Satya (truth) is considered essential, and without it, the universe and reality falls apart, cannot function.&lt;ref name=bahold&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma", in: Mittal, S. &amp; Thursby, G. (Eds.) The Hindu World, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rigveda]], opposed to ''rita'' and ''satya'' are ''anrita'' and ''asatya'' (falsehood).&lt;ref name=rohin/&gt; Truth and truthfulness is considered as a form of reverence for the divine, while falsehood a form of sin. ''Satya'' includes action and speech that is factual, real, true and reverent to ''Ṛta'' in Book 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Rigveda.&lt;ref name=atdn&gt;[[Antonio T. De Nicolás]] (2003), Meditations Through the Rig Veda, {{ISBN|978-0595269259}}, pages 162-164&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Satya'' isn't merely about one's past that is in context in the Vedas, it has one's current and one's future contexts as well. De Nicolás states, that in Rigveda, "''Satya'' is the modality of acting in the world of ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]'', as the truth to be built, formed or established".&lt;ref name=atdn/&gt;

===Upanishads===
''Satya'' is a widely discussed concept in various Upanishads, including the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] where ''satya'' is called the means to [[Brahman]], as well as Brahman (Being, true self).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n843/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], Translator: S Madhavananda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt; In hymn 1.4.14 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, ''Satya'' (truth) is equated to [[Dharma]] (morality, ethics, law of righteousness),&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; as

{{quote|
Nothing is higher than the Law of Righteousness (''Dharma''). The weak overcomes the stronger by the Law of Righteousness. Truly that Law is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks Righteousness"; and if he speaks Righteousness, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|I.4.xiv &lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, page 481, for discussion on Satya and Brahman pages 491-505, 561-575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Paul Horsch (Translated by Jarrod Whitaker), ''From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma'', Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol 32, pages 423–448, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s hymn 11.11 states,&lt;ref&gt;Original hymn is: सत्यं वद । धर्मं चर, ''satyam vada dharmam cara'', [http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/tait_sa.html ॥ तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् ॥] Sanskrit Documents&lt;/ref&gt; "Speak the Satya (truth), conduct yourself according to the Dharma (morality, ethics, law)".&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt;

Truth is sought, praised in the hymns of Upanishads, held as one that ultimately, always prevails. The Mundaka Upanishad, for example, states in Book 3, Chapter 1,&lt;ref name=eeas&gt;E. Easwaran (2007), The Upanishads, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, page 181&lt;/ref&gt;

It defines Satya as "the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well being of creatures, through the actions of one's mind, speech or body."&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), page 173-174, {{oclc|23013613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Deussen|Deussen]] states that ''Satya'' is described in the major Upanishads with two layers of meanings - one as empirical truth about reality, another as abstract truth about universal principle, being and the unchanging. Both these ideas are explained in early Upanishads, composed before 500 BC, by variously breaking the word ''satya'' or ''satyam'' into two or three syllables. In later Upanishads, the ideas evolve and transcend into ''satya'' as truth (or truthfulness), and Brahman as the Being, Be-ness, real Self, the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyupani00deusgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, Harvard University Archives, pages 128-133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics===
The ''[[Shanti Parva]]'' of the [[Mahabharata]] states, "The righteous hold that forgiveness, truth, sincerity and compassion are the foremost (of all virtues). Truth is the essence of the Vedas."&lt;ref&gt;Page 392 ''Mahābhārata: Shanti parva'' (Mokshadharma parva, ch. 174-365), By Om Nath Bimali, Ishvar Chandra, Manmatha Nath Dutt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epic repeatedly emphasizes that ''Satya'' is a basic virtue, because everything and everyone depends on and relies on ''Satya''.&lt;ref name=mnd344/&gt;

===Sutras===
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], it is written, “When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him."&lt;ref name="Sutra Number 2.36"&gt;Patanjali, Sutra Number 2.36, Yoga Sutras 2.30-2.45; B. Ravikanth, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, {{ISBN|978-0988251502}}, pages 140-150&lt;/ref&gt; In Yoga sutra, ''Satya'' is one of the five yamas, or
virtuous restraints, along with ahimsa (restraint from violence or injury to any living being); asteya (restraint from stealing); brahmacharya (celibacy or restraint from sexually cheating on one's partner); and aparigraha (restraint from covetousness and craving). Patanjali considers ''satya'' as a restraint from falsehood in one's action (body), words (speech, writing), or feelings / thoughts (mind).&lt;ref name=grg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Palkhivala, [http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/teaching-the-yamas-in-asana-class/ Teaching the Yamas in Asana Class] Yoga Journal (August 28, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Patanjali's teachings, one may not always know the truth or the whole truth, but one knows if one is creating, sustaining or expressing falsehood, exaggeration, distortion, fabrication or deception.&lt;ref name="Sutra Number 2.36"/&gt; ''Satya'' is, in Patanjali's Yoga, the virtue of restraint from such falsehood, either through silence or through stating the truth without any form of distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant, in Food for the Soul: Vegetarianism and Yoga Traditions (Editor: Steven Rosen), Praeger, {{ISBN|978-0313397035}}, pages 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Buddhism|Sacca}}

The term ''satya'' (Sanskrit; in Pali: ''sacca'') is translated in English as "reality" or "truth." In terms of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''ariyasacca''), the Pali can be written as ''sacca'', ''tatha'', ''anannatatha'' and ''[[dharma|dhamma]]''.

'The Four Noble Truths' (''ariya-sacca'') are the briefest synthesis of the entire teaching of Buddhism, since all those manifold doctrines of the threefold [[Pali canon]] are, without any exception, included therein. They are the truth of suffering (mundane mental and physical phenomenon), of the origin of suffering (tanha 'pali' the craving), of the extinction of suffering (Nibbana or nirvana), and of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] leading to the extinction of suffering (the eight supra-mundane mind factors ).

'''Self-esteem'''   reflects an individual's overall subjective emotional evaluation of their own worth. It is the decision made  by an individual as an attitude towards the self. Self-esteem encompasses [[beliefs]] about oneself, (for example, "I am competent", "I am worthy"), as well as [[emotion]]al states, such as [[wikt:triumph|triumph]], [[depression (mood)|despair]], [[pride]], and [[shame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=John P. |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=217–224 |isbn=978-0-19-518724-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying "The [[self-concept]] is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.

==History==
The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct is thought{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to have its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, geologist, anthropologist [[William James]] (1892).&lt;ref name="James1892"&gt;James, W. (1892). ''Psychology: The briefer course''. New York: Henry Holt.&lt;/ref&gt; James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the 'I-self') and the resulting knowledge about the self (the 'Me-self'). Observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self create three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self, according to James. These are the material self, social self, and spiritual self. The social self comes closest to self-esteem, comprising all characteristics recognized by others. The material self consists of representations of the body and possessions, and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self. This view of self-esteem as the collection of an individual's attitudes toward oneself remains today.&lt;ref name="James1892"/&gt;

In the mid-1960s, sociologist [[Morris Rosenberg]] defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]] (RSES), which became the most-widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterSmartBoden1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Baumeister |first= Roy F. |last2= Smart |first2= L. |last3= Boden |first3= J. |year= 1996 |title= Relation of threatened egotism to violence and aggression: The dark side of self-esteem |journal= [[Psychological Review]] |volume= 103 |issue= 1 |pages= 5–33 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.5 |pmid= 8650299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the [[Behaviorism | behaviorist movement]] minimized introspective study of mental processes, emotions and feelings, replacing introspection with  objective study through experiments on behaviors observed in relation with environment. [[Behaviorism]] viewed the human being as an animal subject to reinforcements, and suggested placing psychology as an experimental science, similar to chemistry or biology. As a consequence, clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked, since behaviorists considered the idea less liable to rigorous measurement.&lt;ref name="Bonet"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=iTwVTnXcuBcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false José-Vicente Bonet. ''Sé amigo de ti mismo: manual de autoestima'']. 1997. Ed. Sal Terrae. Maliaño (Cantabria, España). {{ISBN|978-84-293-1133-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-20th century, the rise of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] and [[humanistic psychology]] led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took a central role in personal [[self-actualization]] and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between [[psychotherapy]] and the personal satisfaction of persons with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt;

In 1992 the [[political scientist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] associated self-esteem with what [[Plato]] called [[thumos | ''thymos'']] - the "[[spiritedness]]" part of the [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul | Platonic soul]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{As of | 1997}} the [[core self-evaluations]] approach included self-esteem as one of four dimensions that comprise one's fundamental appraisal of oneself - along with locus of control, neuroticism, and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Judge1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Judge |first= T.

===Self-esteem in public policy===
The importance of self-esteem gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s, such that one can speak of a self-esteem movement.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Nolan | first =  James L. | title = The Therapeutic State: Justifying Government at Century's End | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-dRzYK1GugC | accessdate = 2013-05-06 | year = 1998 | publisher = NYU Press | isbn = 9780814757918 | pages = 152–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement can be used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} as an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming [[public policy]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} The underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of the problem for individuals, making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions. A leading figure of the movement, psychologist [[Nathaniel Branden]], stated: "[I] cannot think of a single psychological problem – from anxiety and depression, to fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation – that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem".&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Self-esteem was believed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to be a cultural phenomenon of [[Western Society | Western individualistic societies]] since low self-esteem was not found in [[collectivism | collectivist]] countries such as Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led California assemblyman [[John Vasconcellos]] to work to set up and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility in California in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state's problems - from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by [[personal life | life]]'s challenges.

The task force set up committees in many California counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem. This committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences, ultimately showing that low self-esteem is not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought. However, the authors of the paper that summarized the review of the literature still believe that self-esteem is an independent variable that affects major social problems. The task force disbanded in 1995, and the National Council for Self-Esteem and later the [[National Association for Self-Esteem]] (NASE) was established,{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} taking on the task force's mission. Vasconcellos and [[Jack Canfield]] were members of its advisory board in 2003, and members of its Masters' Coalition included [[Anthony Robbins]], [[Bernie Siegel]], and [[Gloria Steinem]].&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;

== Theories ==
Many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation. American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] included self-esteem in his [[hierarchy of human needs]]. He described two different forms of "esteem": the need for respect from others in the form of recognition, success, and admiration, and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love, self-confidence, skill, or aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maslow |first=A. H. |year=1987 |title=Motivation and Personality |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-041987-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization. Maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem "is the one which manifests in respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame and flattery".  Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. [[Sociometer]] theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one's level of status and acceptance in ones' social group. According to ''[[Terror Management Theory]]'', self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greenberg |first=J. |year=2008 |title=Understanding the vital human quest for self-esteem |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00061.x |pmid=26158669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-esteem is important because it shows ourselves how we view the way we are and the sense of our personal value.  Thus, it affects the way we are and act in the world and the way we are related to everybody else.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt;

[[Carl Rogers]] (1902-1987), an advocate of [[humanistic psychology]], theorized the origin of many people's problems to be that they despise themselves and consider themselves worthless and incapable of being loved. This is why Rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt; In his therapy sessions with clients, he offered positive regard no matter what.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wickman S.A. |author2=Campbell C. | year = 2003 | title = An analysis of how Carl Rogers enacted client-centered conversation with Gloria | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 178–184 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2003.tb00239.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person, summarized in the following sentence:

{{cquote|Every human being, with no exception, for the mere fact to be it, is worthy of unconditional respect of everybody else; he deserves to esteem himself and to be esteemed.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;}}

==Measurement==
Self-esteem is typically assessed using self-report inventories.

One of the most widely used instruments, the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]] (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem scale score that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/selfesteem.php#measurement|title=MacArthur SES &amp; Health Network - Research|website=Macses.ucsf.edu|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Lauren |title=The Trouble With Self-Esteem |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 Feb 2002 |accessdate=27 Nov 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/03/magazine/the-trouble-with-self-esteem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit measures of self-esteem began to be used in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bosson J.K. |author2=Swann W.B. |author3=Pennebaker J.W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?. | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 631–643 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rely on indirect measures of [[cognitive processing]] thought to be linked to [[implicit self-esteem]], including the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]].&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L., &amp; Pelham, B. W. (2003). On the nature of implicit self-esteem: The case of the name letter effect. In S. Spencer, S. Fein, &amp; M. P.

When used to assess implicit self-esteem, psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hetts J.J. |author2=Sakuma M. |author3=Pelham B.W. | year = 1999 | title = Two roads to positive regard: Implicit and explicit self-evaluation and culture | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 512–559 | doi=10.1006/jesp.1999.1391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother, psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word, evil, or the positive word, kind.

== Development across lifespan ==
Experiences in a person's life are a major source of how self-esteem develops.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have.&lt;ref name="Raboteg 2014" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Raboteg-Saric Z. |author2=Sakic M. | year = 2014 | title = Relations of parenting styles and friendship quality to self-esteem, life satisfaction, &amp; happiness in adolescents | url = | journal = Applied Research in the Quality of Life | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 749–765 | doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected.

As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons play an important role in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=R. |year=1998 |title=Age Trends in the Use of Social and Temporal Comparison for Self-Evaluation: Examination of a Novel Developmental Hypothesis |journal=Child Development |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=1054–1073 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06160.x |pmid=9768486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomerantz |first=E.

Adolescence shows an increase in self-esteem that continues to increase in young adulthood and middle age.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on whether it is a small or large decrease.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Multiple cohort studies show that there is not a difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of [[social media]].&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt;

High levels of mastery, low risk taking, and better health are ways to predict higher self-esteem. In terms of personality, emotionally stable, extroverted, and conscientious individuals experience higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; These predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt;  However, this does not mean it can not be changed.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers, but then slightly higher levels by age 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erol |first=R.

===Shame===
Shame can be a contributor to those with problems of low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrenreich|first1=Barbara|title=Patterns for college Writing|date=January 2007|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=680|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of shame usually occur because of a situation where the social self is devalued, such as a socially evaluated poor performance.

===Real self, ideal self, and dreaded self===
There are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self, ideal self, and the dreaded self. The real, ideal, and dreaded selves develop in children in a sequential pattern on cognitive levels.&lt;ref name="self-evaluation"&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. Clark |last=Power |first2=Vladimir T. |last2=Khmelkov |title=Character development and self-esteem: Psychological foundations and educational implications |journal=International Journal of Educational Research |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=539–551 |doi=10.1016/S0883-0355(97)00053-0 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Moral Judgment Stages: Individuals describe their Real, Ideal, and Dreaded Selves with stereotypical labels, such as "nice" or "bad". Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves in terms of disposition for action or as behavioral habits. The Dreaded Self is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits. 
#Ego Development Stages: Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves in terms of traits that are based in attitudes as well as actions. The Dreaded Self is often described as having failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered.
#Self-Understanding Stages: Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves as having a unified identity or character. Descriptions of the Dreaded Self focus on a failure to live up to one's ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems. 
This development brings with it increasingly complicated and encompassing moral demands. Level 3 is where individuals' self-esteem can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations. This feeling will moderately effect one's self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their Dreaded Self&lt;ref name="self-evaluation"/&gt;

=== Secure vs. Defensive ===

A person can have a high self-esteem and hold it confidently where they do not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=C.

=== Implicit, explicit, narcissism and threatened egotism ===

[[Implicit self-esteem]] refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with [[explicit self-esteem]], which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper.

[[Narcissism]] is a disposition people may have that represents an excessive love for one's self. It is characterized by an inflated view of self-worth. Individuals who score high on Narcissism measures, Robert Raskin's ''40 Item True or False Test'', would likely select true to such statements as "If I ruled the world, it would be a much better place."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Krahe, ''The Social Psychology of Aggression'' (Psychology Press, 2013), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sedikieds |first=C. |last2=Rudich |first2=E.

Threatened [[egotism]] is characterized as a response to criticism that threatens the ego of narcissists; they often react in a hostile and aggressive manner.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterSmartBoden1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morf |first=C.

=== Low ===

Low self-esteem can result from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, mental health issues, socioeconomic status, significant emotional experiences, [[peer pressure]] or [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jones FC |title=Low self esteem |newspaper=Chicago Defender|pages=33|year=2003 |ISSN=0745-7014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person with low self-esteem may show some of the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adapted, Gill J | year = | title = Indispensable Self-Esteem | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sees temporary setbacks as permanent, intolerable conditions.&lt;ref name="KidsHealth" /&gt;

Individuals with low self-esteem tend to be critical of themselves. Some depend on the approval and praise of others when evaluating self-worth. Others may measure their likability in terms of successes: others will accept themselves if they succeed but will not if they fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=M. W. |last2=Sinclair |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Self-esteem and 'if...then' contingencies of interpersonal acceptance |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1130–1141 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.6.1130 |pmid=8979382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The three states ===
This classification proposed by Martin Ross&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"&gt;Ross, Martín. El Mapa de la Autoestima. 2013. Dunken. {{ISBN|978-987-02-6773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes three states of self-esteem compared to the "feats" ([[wikt:triumph|triumph]]s, [[honor]]s, [[virtue]]s) and the "anti-feats" ([[wikt:defeat|defeat]]s, [[embarrassment]], [[shame]], etc.) of the individuals.&lt;ref name="ecuador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos104/como-influye-genero-autoestima-adolescentes/como-influye-genero-autoestima-adolescentes.shtml|title=Como influye el genero en la Autoestima de los Adolescentes - Monografias.com|first=Darcy Leiva,|last=Monografias.com|website=Monografias.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shattered ====
The individual does not regard themselves as valuable or lovable. They may be overwhelmed by defeat, or shame, or see themselves as such, and they name their "anti-feat". For example, if they consider that being over a certain age is an anti-feat, they define themselves with the name of their anti-feat, and say, "I am old". They express actions and feelings such as pity, insulting themselves, and they may become paralyzed by their sadness.&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"&gt;“Feedback between self-esteem and digital activity in the adolescent group.” Bonet Gallardo, L. Huertas Bailén, Amparo. Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona. 2015 Online at http://ddd.uab.cat/record/142342?ln=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vulnerable ====
The individual has a generally positive self-image. However, their self-esteem is also vulnerable to the perceived risk of an imminent anti-feat (such as defeat, embarrassment, shame, discredit), consequently they are often nervous and regularly use defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt; A typical protection mechanism of those with a Vulnerable Self-Esteem may consist in avoiding decision-making.  Although such individuals may outwardly exhibit great self-confidence, the underlying reality may be just the opposite: the apparent [[self-confidence]] is indicative of their heightened fear of anti-feats and the fragility of their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="ecuador"/&gt; They may also try to blame others to protect their self-image from situations which would threaten it. They may employ defense mechanisms, including attempting to lose at games and other competitions in order to protect their self-image by publicly dissociating themselves from a 'need to win', and asserting an independence from social acceptance which they may deeply desire. In this deep fear of being unaccepted by an individual's peers, they make poor life choices by making risky choices.&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;

==== Strong ====
People with strong self-esteem have a positive [[self-image]] and enough strength so that anti-feats do not subdue their self-esteem. They have less fear of failure. These individuals appear humble, cheerful, and this shows a certain strength not to boast about feats and not to be afraid of anti-feats.&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;
They are capable of fighting with all their might to achieve their goals because, if things go wrong, their self-esteem will not be affected.  They can acknowledge their own mistakes precisely because their self-image is strong, and this acknowledgment will not impair or affect their self-image.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt; They live with less fear of losing social prestige, and with more happiness and general well-being.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;
However, no type of self-esteem is indestructible,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and due to certain situations or circumstances in life, one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;

=== Contingent vs. non-contingent ===
A distinction is made between contingent (or conditional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/contingent|title=Contingent Synonyms, Contingent Antonyms - Thesaurus.com|website=thesaurus.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  and non-contingent (or unconditional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/unconditional|title=Unconditional|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) self-esteem.

'''Contingent self-esteem''' is derived from external sources, such as (a) what others say, (b) one's success or failure, (c) one's competence,&lt;ref name="Koivula-et-al-2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Koivula | first = Nathalie  | last2 = Hassmén | first2 = Peter  | last3 = Fallby | first3 = Johan  | title = Self-esteem and perfectionism in elite athletes: effects on competitive anxiety and self-confidence  | journal = Personality and Individual Differences  | volume = 32 | issue = 5  | year = 2002  | pages = 865–875  | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00092-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (d) [[relationship-contingent self-esteem]].

'''Non-contingent self-esteem''' is described as true, stable, and solid.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Mruk, ''Self-esteem Research, Theory, and Practice'' (Springer, 1995), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; It springs from a belief that one is "acceptable period, acceptable before life itself, ontologically acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Terry D. Cooper, ''Paul Tillich and Psychology: Historic and Contemporary Explorations in Theology, Psychotherapy, and Ethics'' (Mercer University,2006). 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief that one is "ontologically acceptable" is to believe that one's acceptability is "the way things ''be'' without contingency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/includes/articles/selfesteem.pdf|format=PDF|title=Self-esteem/OKness: a personal story|website=Ahpcc.org.uk|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief, as expounded by theologian [[Paul Tillich]], acceptability is not based on a person's virtue.

Cooper, ''Paul Tillich and Psychology: Historic and Contemporary Explorations in Theology, Psychotherapy, and Ethics'' (Mercer University,2006). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Thomas A Harris]] drew on theologian Paul Tillich for his classic [[I'm OK, You're OK|''I'm OK – You're OK'']] that addresses non-contingent self-esteem. Harris translated Tillich's "acceptable" by the vernacular "OK", a term that means "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/OK|title=OK|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian message, said Harris, is not "YOU CAN BE OK, IF", It is "YOU ARE ACCEPTED, unconditionally".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.

A secure non-contingent self-esteem springs from the belief that one is ontologically acceptable and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/PGSG/Kernis%2003%20opt%20s-esteem%20authenticity%20copy.pdf|format=PDF|title=Toward a Conceptualization of Optimal Self-Esteem|author=Michael H.

==Importance==
[[Abraham Maslow]] states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted, loved and respected by others and by her or his self. Self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence, benevolence and optimism, and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize.&lt;ref name="Branden"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=psvHFOqRuhkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nathaniel Branden. ''Cómo mejorar su autoestima'']. 1987. Versión traducida: 1990. 1ª edición en formato electrónico: enero de 2010. Ediciones Paidós Ibérica. {{ISBN|978-84-493-2347-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-esteem may make people convinced they deserve happiness.&lt;ref name="Branden" /&gt; Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since the development of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones.&lt;ref name="Branden" /&gt; For [[Erich Fromm]], love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those who are capable of loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for [[teaching]] professions.&lt;ref name="Miranda"&gt;Christian Miranda. [http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/551/55130179.pdf La autoestima profesional: una competencia mediadora para la innovación en las prácticas pedagógicas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230252/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/551/55130179.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}.

José-Vicente Bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is, he says, not a loss of esteem from others, but self-rejection. Bonet claims that this corresponds to [[Major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt; [[Freud]] also claimed that the depressive has suffered "an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard, an impoverishment of his ego on a grand scale....He has lost his self-respect".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 254-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on [[international human rights law]] addresses the discriminatory attitude toward [[LGBT]] peoples that makes their self-esteem low to be subject to human rights violation including [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], Preamble and Principles 11&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Health Organization]] recommends in "Preventing Suicide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Health Organization|title=Preventing suicide: A global imperative|journal=World Health Organization - Mental Health|date=2014|pages=92|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;" published in 2000 that strengthening students' self-esteem is important to protect children and adolescents against mental distress and despondency, enabling them to cope adequately with difficult and stressful life situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_hearth/media/en/62.pdf|title=Preventing Suicide, A resource for teachers and other school staff, WHO, Geneva, 2000|website=who.int|accessdate=22 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; How this might be done, and whether it would be effective is unclear.

Other than increased happiness, higher self-esteem is also known to be correlated with a better ability to cope with stress and a higher likeliness that the individual takes on difficult tasks relative to those with low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner |chapter=Self Esteem |title=Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Worth |year=2009 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-7167-5215-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correlates ===

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s many Americans assumed as a matter of course that students' self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earn in school, in their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.

Peer-reviewed research undertaken since then has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem in and of itself has no positive effect on grades. [[Roy Baumeister]] has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|author2=Jennifer D. Campbell, Joachim I. Krueger and Kathleen D.

It simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=R.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Attempts by pro-esteem advocates to encourage self-pride in students solely by reason of their uniqueness as human beings will fail if feelings of well-being are not accompanied by well-doing. It is only when students engage in personally meaningful endeavors for which they can be justifiably proud that self-confidence grows, and it is this growing self-assurance that in turn triggers further achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Reasoner, Robert W.

Retrieved February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

High self-esteem has a high correlation to self-reported happiness; whether this is a causal relationship has not been established.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; The relationship between self-esteem and [[life satisfaction]] is stronger in individualistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3psyuli/PReprints/JRP_IESE_SWB.pdf | title=Predictive validity of explicit and implicit self-esteem for subjective well-being | author=Ulrich Schimmack and Ed Diener | journal=Journal of Research in Personality | year=2003 | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=100–106 | doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00532-9}}&lt;!--page 101 mentions two studies that demonstrate this--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, self-esteem has been found to be related to forgiveness in close relationships, in that people with high self-esteem will be more forgiving than people with low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="EatonWardstruthers2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=J|last2=Wardstruthers|first2=C|last3=Santelli|first3=A|title=Dispositional and state forgiveness: The role of self-esteem, need for structure, and narcissism|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=2|year=2006|pages=371–380|issn=0191-8869|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High self-esteem does not prevent children from smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or engaging in early sex.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; One important exception is that high self-esteem reduces the chances of bulimia in females.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;

== Neuroscience ==
In a 2014 research conducted by Robert S. Chavez and Todd F. Heatherton, it was found that self-esteem is related to the connectivity of the [[frontostriatal circuit]]. The frontostriatal pathway connects the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], which deals with [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], to the [[ventral striatum]], which deals with feelings of [[motivation]] and [[Reward system|reward]]. Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/15/scan.nsu063.abstract?sid=47d08b42-0aa2-4f71-a058-1b2e69810145 | title=Multimodal frontostriatal connectivity underlies individual differences in self-esteem | publisher=''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience''.

== Criticism and controversy ==

The American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] criticized on numerous occasions the concept of self-esteem as essentially self-defeating and ultimately destructive.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 2001"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate, he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic, illogical and self- and socially destructive – often doing more harm than good. Questioning the foundations and usefulness of generalized ego strength, he has claimed that self-esteem is based on arbitrary definitional [[premise]]s, and over-generalized, perfectionistic and grandiose thinking.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 2001" /&gt; Acknowledging that rating and valuing behaviours and characteristics is functional and even necessary, he sees rating and valuing human beings' totality and total selves as irrational and unethical. The healthier alternative to self-esteem according to him is unconditional [[self-acceptance]] and unconditional other-[[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=A. |title=The Myth of Self-esteem |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-59102-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]'' is a psychotherapy based on this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPeFALg673MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: Second Edition|first1=Albert Ellis|last1=PhD|first2=Windy Dryden|last2=PhD|date=31 July 2007|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: "There seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem....First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.)...It can also lead people to ignore sensible advice as they stubbornly keep wasting time and money on hopeless causes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumeister |last2=Tierney |year=2011 |title=Willpower: The Greatest's Human Strength |location= |publisher= |page=192 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False attempts ===
For persons with low self-esteem, any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem. Therefore, possessions, sex, success, or physical appearance will produce development of self-esteem, but the development is ephemeral at best.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Branden, ''The Six Pillars of Self-esteem'' (Bantam, 1995), 52. Also see Nathaniel Branden, ''How to Raise Your Self-Esteem: The Proven Action-Oriented Approach to Greater Self-Respect and Self-Confidence'' (Random House, 1988), 9. Spanish edition: ''Cómo mejorar su autoestima'' (Paidos, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attempts to raise one's self-esteem by positive stimulus produce a "boom or bust" pattern. "Compliments and positive feedback" produce a boost, but a bust follows a lack of such feedback. For a person whose "self-esteem is contingent", success is "not extra sweet", but "failure is extra bitter".&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

=== As narcissism ===

Life satisfaction, happiness, healthy behavioral practices, [[Self-efficacy|perceived efficacy]], and academic success and adjustment have been associated with having high levels of self-esteem (Harter, 1987; Huebner, 1991; Lipschitz-Elhawi &amp; Itzhaky, 2005; Rumberger 1995; Swenson &amp; Prelow, 2005; Yarcheski &amp; Mahon, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michaels |first=M. |last2=Barr |first2=A. |last3=Roosa |first3=M. |last4=Knight |first4=G. |year=2007 |title=Self-Esteem: Assessing Measurement Equivalence in a Multiethnic Sample of Youth |journal=Journal of Early Adolescence |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1177/0272431607302009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} However, a common mistake is to think that [[self-love|loving oneself]] is necessarily equivalent to narcissism, as opposed for example to what [[Erik Erikson]] speaks of as "a post-narcissistic love of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Erik H. |last=Erikson |title=[[Childhood and Society]] |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |year=1973 |page=260 |isbn=0-14-020754-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a healthy self-esteem accepts and loves himself/herself unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, and yet, in spite of everything, is able to continue to love her/himself.

In narcissists, by contrast, an " uncertainty about their own worth gives rise to...a self-protective, but often totally spurious, aura of [[grandiosity]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Crompton |title=All about Me |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=2007 |page=16 |isbn=978-0-00-724795-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– producing the class "of narcissists, or people with very high, but insecure, self-esteem... fluctuating with each new episode of social praise or rejection."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem, that is, lack of love towards oneself, but often accompanied by "an immense increase in self-esteem" based on "the [[defense mechanism]] of denial by overcompensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |publisher= |year=1946 |pages=407–410 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"idealized love of self...rejected the part of him" that he denigrates&amp;nbsp;– "this destructive little child"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Neville |last=Symington |title=Narcissism: A New Theory |location=London |publisher=Karmac |year=2003 |page=114 |isbn=1-85575-047-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; within. Instead, the narcissist emphasizes his virtues in the presence of others, just to try to convince himself that he is a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for his faults;&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt; unfortunately such "people with unrealistically inflated self-views, which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information,...tend to have poor social skills."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie" /&gt;{{rp|126}}

The  '''self-schema''' refers to a long lasting and stable set of memories that summarize a person's [[beliefs]], [[experience]]s and generalizations about the [[self]], in specific behavioral domains. A person may have a self-schema based on any aspect of himself or herself as a person, including physical characteristics, personality traits and interests, as long as they consider that aspect of their self important to their own self-definition.

For example, someone will have an [[extroverted]] self-schema if they think of themselves as extroverted and also believe that their extroversion is central to who they are. Their self-schema for extroversion may include general self-categorizations ("I am sociable."), beliefs about how they would act in certain situations ("At a party I would talk to lots of people") and also memories of specific past events ("On my first day at university I made lots of new friends").

== General ==
{{See also|Schema (psychology)}}
The term '''schematic''' describes having a particular schema for a particular dimension. For instance, a person in a [[musical ensemble|rock band]] at night would have a "rocker" schema. However, during the day, if he works as a [[sales]]person, he would have a "salesperson" schema during that period of time. Schemas vary according to [[culture|cultural background]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramírez-Esparza, N., Chung, C. K., Sierra-Otero, G., &amp; Pennebaker, J. W. (2012). Cross-cultural constructions of self-schemas: Americans and Mexicans. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 43(2), 233-250.&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[social environment|environmental factors]].&lt;ref&gt;Leite, C., &amp; Kuiper, N. A. (2010). Positive and negative self-worth beliefs and evaluative standards. Revista De Psihologie, 56(3-4), 219-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once people have developed a schema about themselves, there is a strong tendency for that schema to be maintained by a [[cognitive bias|bias]] in what they attend to, in what they remember, and in what they are prepared to accept as true about themselves. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In other words, the self-schema becomes self-perpetuating. The self-schema is then stored in [[long-term memory]], which both facilitates and biases the processing of personally relevant information.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, L., Stahlberg, D., &amp; Dauenheimer, D. (2000). Effects of self-schema elaboration on affective and cognitive reactions to self-relevant information. Genetic, Social, And General Psychology Monographs, 126(1), 25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who form a self-schema of a person with good exercise habits will then in return exercise more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Banting, L. K., Dimmock, J. A., &amp; Lay, B. S. (2009). The role of implicit and explicit components of exerciser self-schema in the prediction of exercise behaviour. Psychology Of Sport And Exercise, 10(1), 80-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''aschematic''' means not having a schema for a particular dimension. This usually occurs when people are not involved with or concerned about a certain attribute. For example, if a person plans on being a [[music]]ian, a self-schema in [[aeronautics]] will not apply to him; he is aschematic on aeronautics.

Self-schemas vary from person to person because each individual has very different social and cultural life experiences. A few examples of self-schemas are: ''exciting'' or ''dull''; ''quiet'' or ''loud''; ''healthy'' or ''sickly''; ''athletic'' or ''nonathletic''; ''lazy'' or ''active''; and ''geek'' or ''jock''. If a person has a schema for "[[geek]] or [[jock (athlete)|jock]]," for example, he might think of himself as a bit of a computer geek and would possess a lot of information about that trait. Because of this, he would probably interpret many situations based on relevance to his being a computer geek.

Another person with the "[[health]]y or [[illness|sickly]]" schema might consider themselves a very health conscious person. Their concern with being healthy would then affect everyday decisions such as what groceries they buy, what restaurants they frequent, or how often they exercise. Women who are schematic on appearance exhibited lower [[body image]], lower [[self-esteem]], and more [[mood (psychology)|negative mood]] than did those who are aschematic on appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Jahee, J, &amp; Lennon, S.J. (2003). Body Image, Appearance Self-Schema, and Media Images. Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal, 32, Retrieved March 3, 2009, from {{cite web |url=http://fcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/1/27 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427152305/http://fcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/1/27 |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood creation===
Early in life, we are exposed to the idea of the self from our parents and other figures. We begin to take on a very basic self-schema, which is mostly limited to a "good child" or "bad child" schema—that is, we see ourselves in unambiguously positive or negative terms.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} It is in childhood that we begin to offer explanations for our actions, which reasoning creates the more complicated concept of the self: a child will begin to believe that the self caused his or her behaviors, deciding on what motivations to offer as explanations of behavior.&lt;ref name=Blakeslee&gt;{{cite book|last=Blakeslee|first=Thomas R|title=Beyond the conscious mind: Unlocking the secrets of the self|year=1996|publisher=Plenum Publishing Corporation|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-306-45262-6|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiple ==
Most people have multiple self-schemas, however this is not the same as [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] in the pathological sense. Indeed, for the most part, multiple self-schemas are extremely useful to people in daily life. Subconsciously, they help people make rapid decisions and behave efficiently and appropriately in different situations and with different people. Multiple self-schemas guide what people attend to and how people interpret and use incoming information. They also activate specific cognitive, verbal, and behavioral action sequences – called ''[[behavioral script|scripts]]'' and ''action plans'' in [[cognitive psychology]] – that help people meet [[goal]]s efficiently.
Self-schemas vary not only by circumstances and who the person is interacting with, but also by mood. Researchers found that we have mood-congruent self-schemas that vary with our emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jonathon D., and Shelley E. Taylor. "Affect and the Processing of Personal Information: Evidence for Mood-Activated Self-Schemata." Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 22 (1986): 436-452.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The body==
The self's relationship with and understanding of the body is an important part of self-schema. [[Body schema]] is a general term that has multiple definitions in various disciplines. Generally, it refers to a person's concept of his or her own body, where it is in space, what it looks like, how it is functioning, etc.

Our body image is part of our self-schema. The body image includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Shaun (1995). Body schema and intentionality. In N. Eilan, A. Marcel, &amp; J. L. Bermudez (Eds.), '''The body and the self.''' (1-28). USA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''perceptual'' experience of the body
*The ''conceptual'' experience of the body—what we have been told and believe about our body, including scientific information, hearsay, myth, etc.
*The ''emotional attitude'' towards the body

Our body schemata may transcend the realities of what our bodies actually are—or in other words, we may have a different mental picture of our bodies than what they physically are. This is evidenced when individuals who lose limbs have [[phantom limb]] sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Altabe, M. &amp; Thompson, J. K. (1996). Body image: a cognitive self-schema construct. ''Cognitive therapy and research, 20''(2), 171-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who lose a limb may still feel like they have that limb. They may even feel in that limb sensations from other limbs.

==Sexual schema==
Over the years, the emphasis on sex as a means of predicting the emergence of neurosis has shifted to finding the developmental influence that sex has on personality.  This new focus is on the balance between the capacity for sexual pleasure and the establishment of intimate relationships. The assumption here is that to the extent that an individual uses sexuality, one's sexual nature will be experienced as more or less central to one's identity.

Schemas can be viewed as a cognitive framework that organizes the relationship between external social stimuli and one's behavioral reactions. Thus, there are cognitive representations of the self that become active within specific contexts. '''Sexual schema''' is defined as a cognitive generalization about the sexual aspects of the self. This view is derived from past experience, manifested in current experience, influential in the processing of sexually relevant social information, and gives guidance for sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, B. L., &amp; Cyranowski, J. M. (1994). Women's sexual self-schema. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 0022-3514, Vol. 67, Issue 6&lt;/ref&gt; Women and men experience sexual self-schema in their own ways.

Women's sexual schema is composed of two positive aspects: the romantic-passionate and the open-direct self-views, and one negative aspect: embarrassment or conservative self-view. Women with a positive sexual schema tend to view themselves as: emotionally romantic or passionate, open to romantic and sexual relationships and experiences, liberal in their sexual attitudes and free of social inhibitions, evaluating sexual behavior more positively, more likely to engage in uncommitted sex and (one-night) sexual encounters, and more likely to anticipate more sexual partners in the future. Although they might seem very unrestricted, they also are more likely to have romantic ties or partners, and more likely to value romantic, loving, intimate attachments. On the other hand, women with negative sexual self-schema tend to view themselves as emotionally cold and unromantic, behaviorally inhibited in their sexual and romantic relationships, very conservative, and not confident in a variety of social and sexual contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, B. L., &amp; Cyranowski, J. M. (1994). Women's sexual self-schema.  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 0022-3514, Vol. 67, Issue 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's sexual schema can be described along a spectrum from being schematic to aschematic. Schematic men tend to view themselves as powerful and aggressive, open minded and liberal in their sexual attitudes, unquestionably more sexually experienced, and they tend to have a high frequency of sexual relationships, many of which occur without any commitment. In the same way as a woman with a positive sexual schema, these men are capable of feeling romantic love and passion. They are more likely to be in a relationship and to fall in love. Being single is usually just a temporary occurrence.  On the other hand, aschematic men have a narrower range of sexual activities, they are most likely to be single, and the majority believes that situation will not change in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, B. L., &amp; Cyranowski, J. M., Espindle, D. (1999) Men's sexual self-schema.  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 0022-3514, Vol. 76, Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women believe that a sexual person is someone who is sexual, but who can also display romantic, passionate, arousable, and loving qualities in order to establish intimate relationships.

==Effect of illness==
Individuals afflicted with both physical and mental illness have more negative self-schemata. This has been documented in patients suffering from such illnesses as depression and irritable bowel syndrome. Sufferers tend to identify themselves with their illness, unconsciously associating the negative traits of the illness itself with themselves.

Frank describes his work as "poorly drawn cartoons inspired by actual spam subject lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/technology/online-diary.html |title=Online Diary |last=Napoli |first=Lisa |date=August 26, 2004 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/node/141 |title=IT Blogwatch: Email Tyranny, HP's Q2, Outlook Tips, and more... |last=Jennings |first=Richi |date=May 18, 2005 |work=Computer World |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To draw the comics, Frank uses a [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] [[graphics tablet]] to sketch his ideas freehand into his computer, using the application [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=How |title=For Your Spamusement |page=22 |volume=20 |number=1 |year=2005 |publisher=RC Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank's cartoons have occasionally featured repeating characters such Cabinet Sanchez, Eggplant Mike and Troy Powell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spamusers.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Cabinet_Sanchez Cabinet Sanchez], [http://spamusers.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Troy_Powell Troy Powell], {{cite web |url=http://www.spamusers.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Eggplant_Mike |title=Eggplant Mike |work=Spamusement!

He published it on July 23, 2004. The cartoon proved popular and was made into merchandise such as T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/4074 |title=Spamusement: Poorly-drawn cartoons inspired by actual spam subject lines! |work=Mental Floss: Where Knowledge Junkies Get Their Fix |last=Higgins |first=Chris |date=February 13, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2004, [[Worm Quartet]] began performing an original song called "You Were Wrong Cabinet Sanchez" and in 2008 the artist released it as part of the album ''Mental Notes''. The song has been featured on the [[Dr. Demento]] radio show during the final "Funny Five" countdown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wormquartet.livejournal.com/51288.html |title=Worm Quartet Update and Blatant Plug |work=Worm Quartet Blog |author=Shoebox (wormquartet) |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on ''Laughter is a Powerful Weapon Volume 2'', a compilation of songs from the radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoradionews.com/news06/0100061231.htm |title=Best 11 Dementia Albums for 2006 |work=Dave's Radio Blog and Other News Archives |last=Tanny |first=Dave |date=December 31, 2006 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Spamusement!'' site also features forums, one section of which allows readers to create their own spam-inspired comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/e-mail/275315-turning-spam-into-entertainment |title=Turning Spam Into Entertainment |last=Henry |first=Alan |work=Appscout: Stalking the Killer App |publisher=PC Magazine / Ziff Davis Inc. |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank did not contribute for three months in early 2006, then posted irregularly from June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/table_of_malcontents/2006/06/spambased_webco/ |title=Spam-Based Webcomic |author=Wired blogs |work=Wired |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2006, Frank completely turned over the responsibility of comic-making to the forums, although another original comic by Frank appeared on the site in late June 2007.

A '''straight-line diagram''' (abbreviated '''SLD''') is a diagram of a road where the road is shown as a [[straight line]]. Such diagrams are usually produced by a highway department, and display features along the road, including bridges and intersecting roads. Rows below the diagram show data about the road, usually including speed limit, number of lanes, bridge numbers, and historical data, among other data. Subway lines also frequently employ straight-line diagrams.

An internal SLD viewing system may also include links to other internal data, including photos or plans. Public SLDs are distributed in formats including [[portable document format|PDF]] and [[tagged image file format|TIFF]].

In Australia, "strip maps", which serve a similar function, are distributed by state automobile associations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29796">A reference frame in which the time [[coordinate]] defines [[proper time]] for all co-moving observers is called "synchronous". It is built by choosing some [[time-like]] [[hypersurface]] as an origin, such that has in every point a [[normal (geometry) | normal]] along the time line (lies inside the [[light cone]] with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are [[space-like]]. A family of [[geodesics]] normal to this hypersurface are drawn and defined as the time coordinates with a beginning at the hypersurface.

Such a construct, and hence, choice of synchronous frame, is always possible though it is not unique. It allows any transformation of space coordinates that does not depend on time and, additionally, a transformation brought about by the arbitrary choice of hypersurface used for this geometric construct.

== Synchronization over a curved space ==
[[Einstein synchronisation | Synchronization]] of clocks located at different space points means that events happening at different places can be measured as simultaneous if those clocks show the same times. In the special relativity theory, the space distance element ''dl'' is defined as the intervals between two very close events that occur at the same moment of time. In the general relativity theory this cannot be done, that is, one cannot define ''dl'' by just substituting ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 in the metric. The reason for this is the different dependence between [[proper time]] and time coordinate ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in different points of space.
[[File:Synchronization.svg|250px|left|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Synchronization of clocks in curved space through light signals.]]
To find ''dl'' in this case, one can first synchronize time over the whole space in the following way (Fig. 1): Bob sends a light signal from some space point ''B'' with coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; to Alice who is at a very close point ''A'' with coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; and then Alice immediately reflects the signal back to Bob. The time necessary for this operation (measured by Bob), multiplied by ''c'' is, obviously, the doubled distance between [[Alice and Bob]].

The squared interval, with separated space and time coordinates, is:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = g_{\alpha\beta}\, dx^\alpha\, dx^\beta + 2g_{0\alpha}\, dx^0\, dx^\alpha + g_{00} \left ( dx^0 \right )^2,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1}}}}
where a repeated Greek index within a term means summation by values 1, 2, 3. The interval between the events of signal arrival in point ''A'' and its immediate reflection back is zero (two events in the same time at the same point). Equation ''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 solved for ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; gives two roots:
: &lt;math&gt;dx^{0(1)} = \frac{1}{g_{00}} \left ( -g_{0\alpha}\, dx^\alpha - \sqrt{\left ( g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta} - g_{\alpha \beta}g_{00} \right )\, dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;dx^{0(2)} = \frac{1}{g_{00}} \left ( -g_{0\alpha}\, dx^\alpha + \sqrt{\left ( g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta} - g_{\alpha \beta}g_{00} \right ) \,dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2}}}}
which correspond to the propagation of the signal in both directions between Alice and Bob. If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the moment of arrival/reflection of the signal to/from Alice, the moments of signal departure from Bob and its arrival back to Bob correspond, respectively, to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (1)&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (2)&lt;/sup&gt;. The thick lines on Fig. 1 are the world lines of Alice and Bob with coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, while the red lines are the world lines of the signals. Fig. 1 supposes that ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (2)&lt;/sup&gt; is positive and ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (1)&lt;/sup&gt; is negative, which, however, is not necessarily the case: ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (1)&lt;/sup&gt; and ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (2)&lt;/sup&gt; may have the same sign. The fact that in the latter case the value ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (Alice) in the moment of signal arrival at Alice's position may be less than the value ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (Bob) in the moment of signal departure from Bob does not contain a contradiction because clocks in different points of space are not supposed to be synchronized. It is clear that the full "time" interval between departure and arrival of the signal in Bob's place is

: &lt;math&gt;dx^{0(2)} - dx^{0(1)} = \frac{2}{g_{00}} \sqrt{\left ( g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta} - g_{\alpha \beta}g_{00} \right ) \,dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The respective proper time interval is obtained from the above relationship by multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g_{00}}/c&lt;/math&gt;, and the distance ''dl'' between the two points – by additional multiplication by ''c''/2. As a result:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \left ( -g_{\alpha \beta} + \frac{g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta}}{g_{00}} \right )\, dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 3}}}}
This is the required relationship that defines distance through the space coordinate elements.

It is obvious that such synchronization should be done by exchange of light signals between points. Consider again propagation of signals between infinitesimally close points ''A'' and ''B'' in Fig. 1. The clock reading in ''B'' which is simultaneous with the moment ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in ''A'' lies in the middle between the moments of sending and receiving the signal in ''B''; this is the moment
:&lt;math&gt;x^0 + \Delta x^0 = x^0 + \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( dx^{0(2)} + dx^{0(1)} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute here {{EquationNote|eq. 2}} to find the difference in "time" ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; between two simultaneous events occurring in infinitesimally close points as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x^0 = -\frac{g_{0 \alpha}\, dx^\alpha}{g_{00}} \equiv g_\alpha \,dx^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 4}}}}
This relationship allows clock synchronization in any infinitesimally small space volume. By continuing such synchronization further from point ''A'', one can synchronize clocks, that is, determine simultaneity of events along any open line. The synchronization condition can be written in another form by multiplying {{EquationNote|eq. 4}} by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; and bringing terms to the left hand side  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_0 = g_{0i} dx^i = 0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 5}}}}
or, the "covariant differential" ''dx''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; between two infinitesimally close points should be zero.

However, it is impossible, in general, to synchronize clocks along a closed contour: starting out along the contour and returning to the starting point one would obtain a Δ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; value different from zero. Thus, unambiguous synchronization of clocks over the whole space is impossible. An exception are reference frames in which all components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; are zeros.

Note the inability to synchronize all clocks is a property of the reference frame and not of the spacetime itself. It is always possible in infinitely many ways in any gravitational field to choose the reference frame so that the three ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; become zeros and thus enable a complete synchronization of clocks. To this class are assigned cases where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; can be made zeros by a simple change in the time coordinate which does not involve a choice of a system of objects that define the space coordinates.

In the special relativity theory, too, proper time elapses differently for clocks moving relatively to each other. In general relativity, proper time is different even in the same reference frame at different points of space. This means that the interval of proper time between two events occurring at some space point and the time interval between the events simultaneous with those at another space point are, in general, different from one another.

== Space metric tensor ==

Rewrite {{EquationNote|eq. 3}} in the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \gamma_{\alpha \beta} \,dx^\alpha\, dx^\beta,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 6}}}}

where

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\alpha \beta} = -g_{\alpha \beta} + \frac{g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta}}{g_{00}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 7}}}}

is the three-dimensional metric tensor that determines the metric, that is, the geometrical properties of space. Equations {{EquationNote|eq. 7}} give the relationships between the metric of the three-dimensional space and the metric of the four-dimensional spacetime.

In general, however, the metric ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; so that the space metric {{EquationNote|eq. 7}} changes with time. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to integrate ''dl'': this integral depends on the choice of world line between the two points on which it is taken. It follows that in general relativity the distance between two bodies cannot be determined in general; this distance is determined only for infinitesimally close points. Distance can be determined also for finite space regions only in such reference frames in which ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' does not depend on time and therefore the integral '''∫'''''dl'' along the space curve acquires some definite sense.

The tensor&amp;nbsp;–γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; is inverse to the contravariant 3-dimensional tensor ''g''&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, writing equation ''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;kl&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\delta_l^i}&lt;/math&gt; in components, one has:

: &lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}g_{\beta \gamma} + g^{\alpha 0}g_{0 \gamma} = \delta_\gamma^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}g_{\beta 0} + g^{\alpha 0}g_{00} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eqs. 8}}}}

: &lt;math&gt;g^{0 \beta}g_{\beta 0} + g^{00}g_{00} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Determine ''g''&lt;sup&gt;α0&lt;/sup&gt; from the second equation and substitute in the first to obtain

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;-g^{\alpha \beta} \gamma_{\beta \gamma} = \delta_\gamma^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 9}}}}

which was to be demonstrated. This result can be presented otherwise by saying that ''g''&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt; are components of a contravariant 3-dimensional tensor corresponding to metric {{EquationNote|eq. 7}}:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\alpha \beta} = -g^{\alpha \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 10}}}}

The determinants ''g'' and γ composed of elements ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' and γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, are related to each other by the simple relationship:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;-g = g_{00}\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 11}}}}

In many applications, it is convenient to define a 3-dimensional vector '''g''' with covariant components

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_\alpha = -\frac{g_{0 \alpha}}{g_{00}}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 12}}}}

Considering '''g''' as a vector in space with metric {{EquationNote|eq. 7}}, its contravariant components can be written as ''g''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = γ&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Using {{EquationNote|eq. 11}} and the second of {{EquationNote|eqs. 8}}, it is easy to see that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^\alpha = \gamma^{\alpha \beta} g_\beta = -g^{0 \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 13}}}}

From the third of {{EquationNote|eqs. 8}}, it follows

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{00} = \frac{1}{g_{00}} - g_\alpha g^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 14}}}}

==Synchronous coordinates==

As concluded from {{EquationNote|eq. 5}}, the condition that allows clock synchronization in different space points is that metric tensor components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; are zeros. If, in addition, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, then the time coordinate ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' is the proper time in each space point (with ''c'' = 1). A reference frame that satisfies the conditions
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_{00} = 1, \quad g_{0 \alpha} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 15}}}}
is called ''synchronous frame''. The interval element in this system is given by the expression
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dt^2 - g_{\alpha \beta}\, dx^\alpha\, dx^\beta,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 16}}}}
with the spatial metric tensor components identical (with opposite sign) to the components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\alpha \beta} = -g_{\alpha \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 17}}}}
[[File:Time lines.svg|300px|left|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' A synchronous reference frame built with the choice of the timelike hypersurface ''t'' = const (teal color). Only one spatial coordinate ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' is shown. The four observers have the same proper times ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' which are normal to the hypersurface in their locally flat spacetimes (shown by the [[light cones]]). The unit vector ''n''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 is shown in yellow. There are no spatial components (''u''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0) so the common proper time is a geodesic line with a beginning at the hypersurface and a positive direction (red arrows).]]
In synchronous frame time, time lines are normal to the hypersurfaces ''t'' = const. Indeed, the unit four-vector normal to such a hypersurface ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ∂''t''/∂''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' has covariant components ''n''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. The respective contravariant components with the conditions {{EquationNote|eq. 15}} are again ''n''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

The components of the unit normal coincide with those of the four-vector ''u&lt;sup&gt; i&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''dx&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;/ds'' which is tangent to the world line ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = const. The ''u&lt;sup&gt; i&lt;/sup&gt;'' with components ''u''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 automatically satisfies the [[geodesics in general relativity|geodesic equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du^i}{ds} + \Gamma_{kl}^i u^k u^l = \Gamma_{00}^i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
since, from the conditions {{EquationNote|eq. 15}}, the Christoffel symbols &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{00}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{00}^0&lt;/math&gt; vanish identically. Therefore, in the synchronous reference system the time lines are geodesics in the spacetime.

These properties can be used to construct synchronous frame in any spacetime (Fig. 2). To this end, choose some [[spacelike]] [[hypersurface]] as an origin, such that has in every point a normal along the time line (lies inside the [[light cone]] with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are space-like. Then draw a family of geodesics normal to this hypersurface. Choose these lines as time coordinate lines and define the time coordinate ''t'' as the length ''s'' of the geodesic measured with a beginning at the hypersurface; the result is a synchronous frame.

An analytic transformation to synchronous frame can be done with the use of the [[Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equation]]. The principle of this method is based on the fact that particle trajectories in gravitational fields are geodesics. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation#HJE in a gravitational field|Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equation]] for a particle (whose mass is set equal to unity) in a gravitational field is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{ik} \frac{\partial S}{\partial x^i} \frac{\partial S}{\partial x^k} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18a}}}}
where ''S'' is the action. Its complete integral has the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;S = f \left ( \xi^{\alpha}, x^i \right ) + A \left ( \xi^{\alpha} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18b}}}}
where ''f'' is a function of the four coordinates ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and the three parameters ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;; the constant ''A'' is treated as an arbitrary function of the three ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;. With such a representation for ''S'' the equations for the trajectory of the particle can be obtained by equating the derivatives ∂''S''/∂ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; to zero, i.e. 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial \xi^{\alpha}} = - \frac{\partial A}{\partial \xi^{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18c}}}}
For each set of assigned values of the parameters ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, the right sides of equations {{EquationNote|18a-18c}} have definite constant values, and the world line determined by these equations is one of the possible trajectories of the particle. Choosing the quantities ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, which are constant along the trajectory, as new space coordinates, and the quantity ''S'' as the new time coordinate, one obtains a synchronous reference system; the transformation from the old coordinates to the new ones is given by equations {{EquationNote|18b-18c}}. In fact, it is guaranteed that for such a transformation the time lines will be geodesics and will be normal to the hypersurfaces ''S'' = const. The latter point is obvious from the mechanical analogy: the four-vector ∂''S''/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; which is normal to the hypersurface coincides in mechanics with the four-momentum of the particle, and therefore coincides in direction with its four-velocity ''u''&lt;sup&gt; ''i''&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. with the four-vector tangent to the trajectory. Finally the condition ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 is obviously satisfied, since the derivative −''dS''/''ds'' of the action along the trajectory is the mass of the particle, which was set equal to 1; therefore |''dS''/''ds''| = 1.

The gauge conditions {{EquationNote|eq. 15}} do not fix the coordinate system completely and therefore are not a fixed [[gauge theory|gauge]], as the spacelike hypersurface at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen arbitrarily. One still have the freedom of performing some coordinate transformations containing four arbitrary functions depending on the three spatial variables ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, which are easily worked out in infinitesimal form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;x^i = \acute{x}^i + \xi^i(\acute{x}).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18}}}}
Here, the collections of the four old coordinates (''t'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;) and four new coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\acute{t}, \acute{x}^{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt; are denoted by the symbols ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The functions &lt;math&gt;\xi^i(\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt; together with their first derivatives are infinitesimally small quantities. After such a transformation, the four-dimensional interval takes the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = g_{ik}(x)dx^i dx^k = g^{(new)}_{ik} (\acute{x})d\acute{x}^i d\acute{x}^k,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 19}}}}
where
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{(new)}_{ik} (\acute{x}) = g_{ik} (\acute{x}) + g_{il} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial \xi^l (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^k} + g_{kl} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial \xi^l (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^i} + \frac{\partial g_{ik} (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^l} \xi^l (\acute{x}).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 20}}}}
In the last formula, the &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}(\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt; are the same functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') in which ''x'' should simply be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}&lt;/math&gt;. If one wishes to preserve the gauge {{EquationNote|eq. 15}} also for the new metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g^{(new)}_{ik} (\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt; in the new coordinates &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}&lt;/math&gt;, it is necessary to impose the following restrictions on the functions &lt;math&gt;\xi^i (\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \xi^0 (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}} = 0, \quad g_{\alpha \beta} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial \xi^{\beta} (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{t}} - \frac{\partial \xi^0 (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^{\alpha}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 21}}}}
The solutions of these equations are:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\xi^0 = f^0 \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right ), \quad \xi^{\alpha} = \int{g^{\alpha \beta} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial f^0 \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right )}{\partial \acute{x}^{\beta}} d \acute{x}^0 } + f^{\alpha} \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 22}}}}
where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; are four arbitrary functions depending only on the spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a more elementary geometrical explanation, consider Fig. 2. First, the synchronous time line ξ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' can be chosen arbitrarily (Bob's, Carol's, Dana's or any of an infinitely many observers). This makes one arbitrarily chosen function: &lt;math&gt;\xi^0 = f^0 \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right )&lt;/math&gt;. Second, the initial hypersurface can be chosen in infinitely many ways. Each of these choices changes three functions: one function for each of the three spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;\xi^{\alpha} = f^{\alpha} \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right )&lt;/math&gt;. Altogether, four (= 1 + 3) functions are arbitrary.

When discussing general solutions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; of the field equations in synchronous gauges, it is necessary to keep in mind that the gravitational potentials ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; contain, among all possible arbitrary functional parameters present in them, four arbitrary functions of 3-space just representing the gauge freedom and therefore of no direct physical significance.

Another problem with the reference system is that [[caustic (optics)|caustic]]s can occur which cause the gauge choice to break down. These problems have caused some difficulties doing [[cosmological perturbation theory]] in this system, but the problems are now well understood. Synchronous coordinates are generally considered the most efficient reference system for doing calculations, and are used in many modern cosmology codes, such as [[CMBFAST]]. They are also useful for solving theoretical problems in which a spacelike hypersurface needs to be fixed, as with spacelike [[gravitational singularity|singularities]].

==Einstein equations in synchronous frame==
Introduction of a synchronous frame allows one to separate the operations of space and time differentiation in the [[Einstein field equations]]. To make them more concise, the notation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{\partial \gamma_{\alpha \beta}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 23}}}}
is introduced for the time derivatives of the three-dimensional metric tensor; these quantities also form a three-dimensional tensor. In the synchronous frame &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the [[second fundamental form]] (shape tensor). All operations of shifting indices and covariant differentiation of the tensor &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; are done in three-dimensional space with the metric γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;. This does not apply to operations of shifting indices in the space components of the four-tensors ''R&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''. Thus ''T''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; must be understood to be ''g''&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''&lt;sup&gt;β0&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt;, which reduces to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt; and differs in sign from γ&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt;. The sum &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the logarithmic derivative of the determinant γ ≡ |γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;| = − ''g'':
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha}^{\alpha} = \gamma^{\alpha \beta} \frac{\partial \gamma_{\alpha \beta}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ln{(\gamma)}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 24}}}}
Then for the complete set of [[Christoffel symbols]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kl}^i&lt;/math&gt; one obtains:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{00}^{0} = \Gamma_{00}^{\alpha} = \Gamma_{0 \alpha}^0 = 0, \quad \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^0 = \frac{1}{2} \varkappa_{\alpha \beta}, \quad \Gamma_{0 \beta}^{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2} \varkappa_{\beta}^{\alpha}, \quad \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma} = \lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 25}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; are the three-dimensional Christoffel symbols constructed from γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma} = \frac{1}{2} \gamma^{\gamma \mu} \left ( \gamma_{\mu \alpha,\beta} + \gamma_{\mu \beta,\beta} - \gamma_{\alpha \beta,\mu} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 26}}}}
where the comma denotes partial derivative by the respective coordinate.

With the Christoffel symbols {{EquationNote|eq. 25}}, the components ''R&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sup&gt;il&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;lk&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the [[Ricci tensor]] can be written in the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_0^0=-\frac{1}{2} \dot{\varkappa}-\frac{1}{4} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \varkappa_{\beta}^{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 27}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{0}=\frac{1}{2} \left (\varkappa_{\alpha;\beta}^{\beta} - \varkappa_{,\alpha} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 28}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{\beta}=-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\gamma}} \dot{\left (\sqrt{\gamma} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \right )} - P_{\alpha}^{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 29}}}}
Dots on top denote time differentiation, semicolons (";") denote covariant differentiation which in this case is performed with respect to the three-dimensional metric γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; with three-dimensional Christoffel symbols &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varkappa \equiv \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; is a three-dimensional Ricci tensor constructed from &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{\alpha}^{\beta} = \gamma^{\beta \gamma} P_{\gamma \alpha}, \quad P_{\alpha \beta} = \lambda_{\alpha \beta, \gamma}^{\gamma} - \lambda_{\gamma \alpha, \beta}^{\gamma} + \lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma} \lambda_{\gamma \mu}^{\mu} - \lambda_{\alpha \mu}^{\gamma} \lambda_{\beta \gamma}^{\mu}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 30}}}}
It follows from {{EquationNote|eq. 27–29}} that the Einstein equations &lt;math&gt;R_i^k = 8 \pi k \left ( T_i^k - \frac{1}{2} \delta_i^k T \right )&lt;/math&gt; (with the components of the energy-momentum tensor ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = −''T''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = −''T''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; = γ&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt;) become in a synchronous coordinate system:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_0^0=-\frac{1}{2} \dot{\varkappa}-\frac{1}{4} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \varkappa_{\beta}^{\alpha} = 8 \pi k \left ( T_0^0 - \frac{1}{2} T \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 31}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{0}=\frac{1}{2} \left (\varkappa_{\alpha;\beta}^{\beta} - \varkappa_{,\alpha} \right ) = 8 \pi k T_{\alpha}^0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 32}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{\beta}=-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\gamma}} \dot{\left (\sqrt{\gamma} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \right )} - P_{\alpha}^{\beta} = 8 \pi k \left ( T_{\alpha}^{\beta} - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{\alpha}^{\beta} T \right ).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 33}}}}
A characteristic feature of synchronous reference systems is that they are not stationary: the [[gravitational field]] cannot be constant in such a system. In a constant field &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; would become zero. But in the presence of matter the disappearance of all &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; would contradict {{EquationNote|eq. 31}} (which has a right side different from zero). In empty space from {{EquationNote|eq. 33}} follows that all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, and with them all the components of the three-dimensional curvature tensor ''P''&lt;sub&gt;αβγδ&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Riemann tensor]]) vanish, i.e. the field vanishes entirely (in a synchronous system with a [[Euclidean metric|Euclidean spatial metric]] the space-time is flat).

At the same time the matter filling the space cannot in general be at rest relative to the synchronous reference frame. This is obvious from the fact that particles of matter within which there are pressures generally move along lines that are not geodesics; the [[world line]] of a particle at rest is a time line, and thus is a geodesic in the synchronous reference system. An exception is the case of dust (''p'' = 0). Here the particles interacting with one another will move along geodesic lines; consequently, in this case the condition for a synchronous reference system does not contradict the condition that it be comoving with the matter. Even in this case, in order to be able to choose a synchronously comoving system of reference, it is still necessary that the matter move without rotation. In the comoving system the contravariant components of the velocity are ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, ''u''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. If the reference system is also synchronous, the covariant components must satisfy ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, so that its four-dimensional [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] must vanish:
:&lt;math&gt;u_{i;k} - u_{k;i} \equiv \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x^i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
But this tensor equation must then also be valid in any other reference frame. Thus, in a synchronous but not comoving system the condition curl '''v''' = 0 for the three-dimensional velocity '''v''' is additionally needed. For other [[equations of state]] a similar situation can occur only in special cases when the pressure gradient vanishes in all or in certain directions.

The '''Szarvas inscription''' refers to the inscription on a bone [[needlecase|needle case]] found near [[Szarvas]] in southeastern [[Hungary]] and dating from the second half of the 8th century, the "[[Late Avar]]" period (700-791).&lt;ref&gt;[[András Róna-Tas|Róna-Tas, András]] (1996): A honfoglaló magyar nép [The landtaking Hungarian nation].

==The name of the script of the Szarvas inscription==
[[File:Carphatian_Basin_Rovas_alphabet_on_coin_1996.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Picture of the bone needle case of Szarvas with Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet on a coin issued around 1996.]]
The Hungarian archeologist, historian and linguist [[Gábor Vékony]] named the script used on the needle case  as ''"Kárpát-medencei rovásírás"'' ("Carpathian Basin Rovas script").&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 203, first line of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Hosszú: [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4006.pdf Proposal for encoding the Carpathian Basin Rovas script in the SMP of the UCS]. National Body Contribution for consideration by UTC and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2, January 21, 2011, revised: May 19, 2011, Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set. ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N4006&lt;/ref&gt; He often used this term in his  book, ''A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története'', e.g. in the chapter ''"A kárpát-medencei rovásábécé korabeli feljegyzése"'' ("The contemporary record of the Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet").

Vékony analysed the similarities and the differences between the Old Hungarian and the Carpathian Basin scripts on page 154 of his book.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 154, first row of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; On page 232, Vékony wrote: ''"- Aethicus Ister jelei azonosak az egykori Kárpát-medencei rovásírás jeleivel."'' ("The symbols of Aethicus Ister are identical to the symbols of the quondam Carpathian Basin script").&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 232, eighth and ninth rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

Vékony also writes : ''"E jel a Szarvason azonosított Kárpát-medencei '''f''' alig torzult megfelelője..."'' ("This symbol is identical to the Carpathian Basin 'f' identified in Szarvas". (referring to the bone needle case found in Szarvas)&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 235, second and third rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

In page 233, Vékony writes: ''"Erre utalhat az is, hogy ez a betűalak levezethető egy párthus alep formából. Feltehető tehát ennek a jelnek a megléte a Kárpát-medencei rovásírásban is (a székelybe is innen származhatott)."'' ("This could imply also that this glyph can be derived from the Parthian Aleph form. Consequently, the existence of this symbol can be supposed in the Carpathian Basin script as well (it could originate from this to the Székely)."&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 233, last six rows in the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; Here the 'Szekely' refers to the ''Szekely-Hungarian Rovas'' script also known as [[Old Hungarian script]]. Vékony's writing suggests a proposal that a Carpathian Basin Rovas script may be one of the ancestors of the Szekely-Hungarian Rovas script.

== The meaning of the inscription ==

Szombathely-Budapest&lt;/ref&gt;  was improved by linguist Erzsébet Zelliger.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  The last character of the fourth row of the inscription was reconstructed by Vékony. The edges of the bone needle case are worn, and the top and bottom edges for part of the characters are not clearly visible.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony, Gábor (1987): Későnépvándorláskori rovásfeliratok a Kárpát-medencében [Runic inscriptions from the Late Migration Period in the Carpathian Basin].

In the inscription, the third symbol of the third row (from left) could be considered a descendant of the [[ideograms]] in [[Turkic languages]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} However, their possible relationship needs further evidence.

==Critics and alternative theories==
Vékony had read the Szarvas transcription as Hungarian, thus proposing it as evidence that the Hungarian-speaking people had appeared in the region by the 7th century. There are several critics of Vékony's theories and translations, most notably the Hungarian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and historian, [[András Róna-Tas]]. The debates were summarized by István Riba in 1999 and 2000: "many find themselves unable to accept Vékony's theory".&lt;ref&gt;Riba,István: Jöttek, honfoglaltak, fújtak. Régészvita egy rovásírásról [Came, settled, blown. Archaeological debate about the runic writing]. In: Heti Világgazdaság [Weekly Word's Economy], Vol. 21. 1999. N. 46. pp. 101-102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riba, István (2000). [http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no157/080.shtml "Reading the Runes: Evidence of the Dual Conquest?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316014918/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no157/080.shtml |date=16 March 2012 }}. ''The Hungarian Quarterly''. Vol. XLI. No. 157, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The key point of the critics has been that in traditional Hungarian scholarship, the existence of the Hungarian-speaking population dates from 896 (when the [[Magyars]] took over the [[History of Hungary#Middle Ages .28895.E2.80.931526.29|Carpathian Basin]] ), while the Szarvas needle case dates from the 8th century. Consequently, either the Szarvas inscription is not in Hungarian or Hungarians were in the Carpathian Basin much earlier than the late 9th century. Róna-Tas attempted to read the Szarvas relic in Turkic instead of Hungarian, but wrote that his transcription needed further improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[[András Róna-Tas|Róna-Tas, András]] (1996): A honfoglaló magyar nép [The landtaking Hungarian nation]. Bevezetés a korai Magyar történelem ismeretébe [Introduction to the knowledge of the early Hungarian history]. Budapest: Balassi Kiadó, pp. 108-110&lt;/ref&gt; The issue remains an open question amongst Hungarian scholars.

'''''Thought and Change''''' is a 1964 book by the philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], in which the author outlines his views on "[[modernity]]" and looks at the processes of social change and historical transformation and, perhaps most forcefully, the power of nationalism. Maleŝević and Haugaard argue that the method is the socio-historical method, and Gellner sets out a powerful sociology of specific philosophical doctrines and ideologies, from [[utilitarianism]] and [[Kantianism]] to [[nationalism]]. The chapter specifically dealing with nationalism was later expanded to form the basis of Gellner's most famous book, ''[[Nations and Nationalism (book)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' (1983).

They also note that rather than looking at the internal coherence of philosophies, Gellner places them in their historical context. He thus explains their origins and their likely influence. Modernity is considered to be "unique, unprecedented and exceptional", with characteristics sustained by growth of economies and increases in cultural uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;Maleŝević, Siniŝa, and Mark Haugaard (ed.), 2007, ''Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of feminism==
;1848-1920
* [[First-wave feminism]] was a period of feminist activity and thought that occurred within the 19th and early 20th century throughout the world. It focused on legal issues, primarily on gaining women's suffrage (the right to vote).
; 1960s
* 1963: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published; it is a book written by [[Betty Friedan]] which is widely credited with starting the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/thisweek/feb/17/1963/betty-friedan|title=Publication of "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan - Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity and thought that began in the early 1960s in the United States, and spread throughout the Western world and beyond. In the United States the movement lasted through the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. ''The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Black feminism]] became popular because of the exclusion from the civil rights movement and the feminist movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} 
* [[Radical feminism]] emerged in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 60's without Apology |issue=9/10|year=1984|pages=91–118|jstor=466537}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: "The Discontent of Women", by [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smits]], was published&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;; the publication of this essay is often regarded as the start of [[second-wave feminism]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joke-smit-feministe-en-journaliste|title=Joke Smit: feministe en journaliste|date=6 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Smit describes the frustration of married women, saying they are fed up being solely mothers and housewives.
* 1969: [[Chicana feminism]], also called Xicanisma, is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the [[Chicano movement]] and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference, women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns. After the conference, women returned to their communities as activists and thus began the Chicana feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; 1970s
*  In the 1970s, [[Feminism in France|French feminist]] theorists approached feminism with the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as female, or feminine writing).&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth (2000). ''Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters)''. Totem Books or Icon Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
; 1980s
* The [[radical lesbian]] movement is a [[francophone]] lesbian movement roughly analogous to [[English-language]] lesbian separatism. Inspired by the writings of philosopher [[Monique Wittig]],&lt;ref&gt;Turcotte, Louise. (foreword) ''The Straight Mind and Other Essays'', Monique Wittig, Beacon Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-8070-7917-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;ix&lt;/ref&gt; the movement originated in [[France]] in the early 1980s, spreading soon after to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]].
* In [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;Badran, Margot, ''Feminism in Islam: Secular and Religious Convergences'' (Oxford, Eng.: Oneworld, 2009) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Marcia, "Theorizing Israeli Feminism, 1970–2000", in Misra, Kalpana, &amp; Melanie S. Rich, ''Jewish Feminism in Israel: Some Contemporary Perspectives'' (Hanover, N.H.: Univ. Press of New England (Brandeis Univ. Press) 2003) pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; [[second-wave feminism]] began in the 1980s.
* [[Difference feminism]] was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasizes the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it is still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasizes the differences between men and women and argues that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aims to make society and law gender-neutral, since it sees recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism holds that gender-neutrality harms women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31232">A '''truth table''' is a [[mathematical table]] used in [[logic]]—specifically in connection with [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[boolean function]]s, and [[propositional calculus]]—which sets out the functional values of logical [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables ([[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]], 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]].

A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, P and Q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, P XOR Q). Each row of the truth table contains one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, P=true Q=false), and the result of the operation for those values. See the examples below for further clarification. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is often credited with inventing the truth table in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] | title = Ludwig Wittgenstein, A Biographical Sketch | journal = The Philosophical Review | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | year = 1955 | pages = 527–545 (p. 532, note 9) | jstor = 2182631 | doi=10.2307/2182631}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it appeared at least a year earlier in a paper on propositional logic by [[Emil Leon Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Emil Post]]|title=Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|date=July 1921|volume=43|issue=3|pages=163–185|jstor= 2370324|doi=10.2307/2370324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unary operations==

There are 4 unary operations:
*Always true
*Never true, unary ''[[falsum]]''
*Unary ''Identity'' 
*Unary ''negation'' 

===Logical true===
The output value is always true, regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical True'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''T''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T ||  T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}
===Logical false===
The output value is never true: that is, always false,  regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical False'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical identity===
[[Identity function|Logical identity]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]] p, for which the output value remains p.

The truth table for the logical identity operator is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Identity'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical negation===
[[Logical negation]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' if its operand is false and a value of ''false'' if its operand is true.

The truth table for '''NOT p''' (also written as '''¬p''', '''Np''', '''Fpq''', or '''~p''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Negation'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''¬p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}


==Binary operations==

There are 16  possible [[truth function]]s of two [[binary variable]]s:

===Truth table for all binary logical operators===
Here is an extended truth table giving definitions of all possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Information about notation may be found in [[Józef Maria Bocheński|Bocheński]] (1959), [[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]] (2001), and [[W. V. Quine|Quine]] (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:T = true.
:F = false.
:The '''Com''' row indicates whether an operator, '''op''', is [[Commutative property|commutative]] - '''P op Q = Q op P'''.
:The '''L id''' row shows the operator's [[left identity|left identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''I op Q = Q'''.
:The '''R id''' row shows the operator's [[right identity|right identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''P op I = P'''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The operators here with equal left and right identities (XOR, AND, XNOR, and OR) are also [[monoid#Commutative_monoid|commutative monoids]] because they are also [[Associative_property|associative]]. While this distinction may be irrelevant in a simple discussion of logic, it can be quite important in more advanced mathematics. For example, in [[category theory]] an [[enriched category]] is described as a base [[category (mathematics)|category]] enriched over a monoid, and any of these operators can be used for enrichment.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The four combinations of input values for p, q, are read by row from the table above.
The output function for each  p, q combination, can be read, by row, from the table.

'''Key:'''

The following table is oriented by column, rather than by row. There are four columns rather than four rows, to display the four combinations of p, q, as input. 

'''p''': T T F F&lt;br&gt;
'''q''': T F T F

There are 16 rows in this key, one row for each binary function of the two binary variables, p, q. For example, in row 2 of this Key, the value of [[Converse nonimplication]] ('&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;') is solely T, for the column denoted by the unique combination p=F, q=T; while  in row 2, the value of that '&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;' operation is F for the three remaining columns of p, q. The output row for &lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt; is thus

Logical operators can also be visualized using [[Venn diagram#Overview|Venn diagram]]s.

===Logical conjunction (AND)===
[[Logical conjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are true.

The truth table for '''p AND q''' (also written as '''p ∧ q''', '''Kpq''', '''p &amp; q''', or '''p''' &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; '''q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Conjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∧ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

In ordinary language terms, if both ''p'' and ''q'' are true, then the conjunction ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is true.  For all other assignments of logical values to ''p'' and to ''q'' the conjunction ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'' is false.

It can also be said that if ''p'', then ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''q'', otherwise ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''p''.

===Logical disjunction (OR)===
[[Logical disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p OR q''' (also written as '''p ∨ q''', '''Apq''', '''p || q''', or '''p + q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∨ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

Stated in English, if ''p'', then ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''p'', otherwise ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''q''.

===Logical implication===
Logical implication and the [[material conditional]] are both associated with an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, which produces a value of ''false'' if the first operand is true and the second operand is false, and  a value of ''true'' otherwise.

The truth table associated with the logical implication '''p implies q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''', or more rarely '''Cpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Implication'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⇒ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The truth table associated with the material conditional '''if p then q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Material Conditional '''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' → ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It may also be useful to note that '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''' and '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''' are equivalent to '''¬p&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;q'''.

===Logical equality===
[[Logical equality]] (also known as biconditional) is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both operands are false or both operands are true.

The truth table for '''p XNOR q''' (also written as '''p ↔ q''', '''Epq''', '''p = q''', or '''p ≡ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equality'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↔ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

So p EQ q is true if p and q have the same [[truth value]] (both true or both false), and false if they have different truth values.

===Exclusive disjunction===
[[Exclusive disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if one but not both of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p XOR q''' (also written as '''p ⊕ q''', '''Jpq''', '''p ≠ q''', or '''p ↮ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Exclusive Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⊕ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

For two propositions, '''XOR''' can also be written as (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q).

===Logical NAND===
The [[logical NAND]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''false'' if both of its operands are true.  In other words, it produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is false.

The truth table for '''p NAND q''' (also written as '''p ↑ q''', '''Dpq''', or '''p | q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NAND'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↑ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It is frequently useful to express a logical operation as a compound operation, that is, as an operation that is built up or composed from other operations.  Many such compositions are possible, depending on the operations that are taken as basic or "primitive" and the operations that are taken as composite or "derivative".

In the case of logical NAND, it is clearly expressible as a compound of NOT and AND.

The negation of a conjunction: ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the disjunction of negations: (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:15%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:15%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:15%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:15%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-
| T || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

===Logical NOR===
The [[logical NOR]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of ''false'' if at least one of its operands is true. ↓ is also known as the [[Peirce arrow]] after its inventor, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and is a [[Sole sufficient operator]].

The truth table for '''p NOR q''' (also written as '''p ↓ q''', or '''Xpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NOR'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↓ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The negation of a disjunction ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the conjunction of negations (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:10%" | ''p''
! style="width:10%" | ''q''
! style="width:10%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:10%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:10%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:10%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:10%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-
| T || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

Inspection of the tabular derivations for NAND and NOR, under each assignment of logical values to the functional arguments ''p'' and ''q'', produces the identical patterns of functional values for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q''), and for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'').  Thus the first and second expressions in each pair are logically equivalent, and may be substituted for each other in all contexts that pertain solely to their logical values.

This equivalence is one of [[De Morgan's laws]].

==Applications==
Truth tables can be used to prove many other [[logical equivalence]]s.  For example, consider the following truth table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equivalence : &lt;math&gt;(p \Rightarrow q) \equiv (\lnot p \lor q)&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T
|}

This demonstrates the fact that &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;.

===Truth table for most commonly used logical operators===
Here is a truth table that gives definitions of the 6 most commonly used out of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Propositions 4.*-5.*|the 16 possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Q &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \underline{\lor} Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \underline{\land} Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;  ||  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  T  ||  T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F 
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F  || T ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F 
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F  || style="background:papayawhip" | F  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  T  ||  T
|}

where

:T = true
:F = false
:&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conjunction|AND]] (logical conjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical disjunction|OR]] (logical disjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\lor}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive or|XOR]] (exclusive or) &lt;!-- this could be "+" instead according to other articles --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\land}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive nor|XNOR]] (exclusive nor)
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conditional|conditional "if-then"]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; = conditional "then-if"
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[if and only if|biconditional "if-and-only-if"]].

===Condensed truth tables for binary operators===
For binary operators, a condensed form of truth table is also used, where the row headings and the column headings specify the operands and the table cells specify the result. For example, [[Boolean logic]] uses this condensed truth table notation:

{|
|-
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∧ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || F
|-
! T
| F || T
|}
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∨ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || T
|-
! T
| T || T
|}
|}

This notation is useful especially if the operations are commutative, although one can additionally specify that the rows are the first operand and the columns are the second operand. This condensed notation is particularly useful in discussing multi-valued extensions of logic, as it significantly cuts down on combinatoric explosion of the number of rows otherwise needed. It also provides for quickly recognizable characteristic "shape" of the distribution of the values in the table which can assist the reader in grasping the rules more quickly.

===Truth tables in digital logic===
Truth tables are also used to specify the function of [[Lookup table#Hardware LUTs|hardware look-up tables (LUTs)]] in [[Digital circuit|digital logic circuitry]]. For an n-input LUT, the truth table will have 2^''n'' values (or rows in the above tabular format), completely specifying a boolean function for the LUT. By representing each boolean value as a [[bit]] in a [[Binary numeral system|binary number]], truth table values can be efficiently encoded as [[integer]] values in [[Electronic design automation|electronic design automation (EDA)]] [[software]]. For example, a 32-bit integer can encode the truth table for a LUT with up to 5 inputs.

When using an integer representation of a truth table, the output value of the LUT can be obtained by calculating a bit index ''k'' based on the input values of the LUT, in which case the LUT's output value is the ''k''th bit of the integer. For example, to evaluate the output value of a LUT given an [[Array data structure|array]] of ''n'' boolean input values, the bit index of the truth table's output value can be computed as follows: if the ''i''th input is true, let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, else let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''k''th bit of the binary representation of the truth table is the LUT's output value, where &lt;math&gt;k = V_0 \times 2^0 + V_1 \times 2^1 + V_2 \times 2^2 + \dots + V_n \times 2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Truth tables are a simple and straightforward way to encode boolean functions, however given the [[exponential growth]] in size as the number of inputs increase, they are not suitable for functions with a large number of inputs. Other representations which are more memory efficient are text equations and [[binary decision diagram]]s.

===Applications of truth tables in digital electronics===
In digital electronics and computer science (fields of applied logic engineering and mathematics), truth tables can be used to reduce basic boolean operations to simple correlations of inputs to outputs, without the use of [[logic gate]]s or code. For example, a binary addition can be represented with the truth table:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B | C R
1 1 | 1 0
1 0 | 0 1
0 1 | 0 1
0 0 | 0 0

where

A = First Operand
B = Second Operand
C = Carry
R = Result
&lt;/pre&gt;

This truth table is read left to right:
* Value pair (A,B) equals value pair (C,R).
* Or for this example, A plus B equal result R, with the Carry C.

Note that this table does not describe the logic operations necessary to implement this operation, rather it simply specifies the function of inputs to output values.

With respect to the result, this example may be arithmetically viewed as modulo 2 binary addition, and as logically equivalent to the exclusive-or (exclusive disjunction) binary logic operation.

In this case it can be used for only very simple inputs and outputs, such as 1s and 0s. However, if the number of types of values one can have on the inputs increases, the size of the truth table will  increase.

For instance, in an addition operation, one needs two operands, A and B. Each can have one of two values, zero or one. The number of combinations of these two values is 2×2, or four. So the result is four possible outputs of C and R.  If one were to use base 3, the size would increase to 3×3, or nine possible outputs.

The first "addition" example above is called a half-adder. A full-adder is when the carry from the previous operation is provided as input to the next adder. Thus, a truth table of eight rows would be needed to describe a [[full adder]]'s logic:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B C* | C R
0 0 0  | 0 0
0 1 0  | 0 1
1 0 0  | 0 1
1 1 0  | 1 0
0 0 1  | 0 1
0 1 1  | 1 0
1 0 1  | 1 0
1 1 1  | 1 1

Same as previous, but..
C* = Carry from previous adder
&lt;/pre&gt;

==History==
Irving Anellis has done the research to show that [[C.S. Peirce]] appears to be the earliest logician (in 1893) to devise a truth table matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anellis|first1=Irving H.|title=Peirce's Truth-functional Analysis and the Origin of the Truth Table|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|date=2012|volume=33|pages=87–97|doi=10.1080/01445340.2011.621702}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the summary of his paper:
&lt;blockquote&gt; In 1997, John Shosky discovered, on the verso of a page of the typed transcript of Bertrand Russell's 1912 lecture on "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" truth table matrices. The matrix for negation is Russell's, alongside of which is the matrix for material implication in the hand of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is shown that an unpublished manuscript identified as composed by Peirce in 1893 includes a truth table matrix that is equivalent to the matrix for material implication discovered by John Shosky. An unpublished manuscript by Peirce identified as having been composed in 1883–84 in connection with the composition of Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation" that appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' in 1885 includes an example of an indirect truth table for the conditional. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Vegetarian ecofeminism''' is an activist and academic movement&lt;ref&gt;''Lois Ann Lorentzen, University of San Francisco, and Heather Eaton, Saint Paul University (2002)''&lt;/ref&gt; which states that all types of [[oppression]] are linked and must be eradicated, with a focus on including the domination of humans over nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Through the feminist concept known as [[intersectionality]], it is recognized that [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[classism]], and other forms of inter human oppression are all connected. Vegetarian ecofeminism aims to include the domination of not only the environment but also of nonhuman animals to the list.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gaard, Greta. "Vegetarian Ecofeminism: A Review Essay."

Web. 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the academic and philosophical field of [[ecofeminism]], which states that the ways in which the privileged dominates the oppressed should include the way humans dominate nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Adams | first1=Carol | year=1991| title=Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals | doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1991.tb00213.x | journal=Hypatia | volume=1991 | issue=| pages=125–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme within ecofeminism is the belief that there is a strong connection between the domination of women and the domination of nature, and that both must be eradicated in order to end oppression.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminism extends beyond ecofeminism because it believes that the way in which humans exploit and kill nonhuman animals should be distinctly recognized, and that the oppression of humans is linked to the oppression of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The concept of [[speciesism]] is central to distinguishing between vegetarian ecofeminism and ecofeminism, and it strongly links the [[hierarchies]] created among nonhuman animals to the hierarchies created among humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Distinguishing between ecofeminism and vegetarian ecofeminism is important because of vegetarian ecofeminism's focus on the oppression of nonhuman animals provides connections between the other linked forms of oppression, but specifically the oppression of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a4443d40-b53a-427f-98dd-533f23a76bdf%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=104|title=Linking Sexism and Speciesism|last=Wyckoff|first=Jason|date=1 September 2014|journal=Hypatia|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/hypa.12098 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speciesism==
{{Main|Speciesism}}
Speciesism is a form of oppression central to the ecofeminist concept,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and the belief that speciesism is a valid form of oppression that must be eradicated is at the center of most vegetarian ecofeminist arguments. It is used to support the exploitation and killing of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Much like any other form of oppression, speciesism is a social construction that benefits the dominant at the expense of the oppressed.

===Humanism in opposition to vegetarian ecofeminism===
[[Humanist]]s believe that speciesism is not a "bad -ism" like racism or sexism, because while women, people of color, and any other group of oppressed humans are moral humans, nonhuman animals are not and therefore do not deserve the same rights.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Against "Humanism": Speciesism, Personhood, and Preference|last=Cushing|first=Simon|date=2003|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to humanism, the domination of humans over animals is justified, and animals are indeed meant for human [[Consumer (food chain)|consumption]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Human rights are inherently more important than animal rights because their biological differences from human makes them morally different as well.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that there is an inherent bond between humans and nonhuman animals, and the human supremacy and degradation of animals that ensues is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]] meant to undermine the human-animal bond.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Luke | first1=Brian | year=| title=Justice, Caring, and Animal Liberation | url=| journal=Animals and Women | volume=1992 | issue=| pages=81–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact not the characteristic of an abnormal few who care and empathize with nonhuman animals, but the normal state for most humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This is exemplified by the cross-cultural practice of pet-keeping or the usage of animals in therapy, which demonstrate the strength of the bond between humans and animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The act of [[expiation]] in which humans justify the act of killing nonhuman animals shows that humans are inclined not to harm animals, otherwise there would not need to be any mechanisms created cross-culturally to help deal with the guilt felt in killing animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Hierarchies===
The hierarchy created among nonhuman animals validates the hierarchies created among humans. Humans identify more closely with nonhuman animals that have human characteristics, and this allows for humans to create a hierarchy that places nonhuman that humans are able to identify more closely with at the top, and those it shares less characteristics with at the bottom.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Humans have evolved to sympathize with beings similar to themselves.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This allows humans to justify the killing of certain animals over others, because due to the hierarchy humans have created, some animals are of lesser value and therefore have fewer rights. For example, Western cultures kill cows, chickens, and fish for consumption, but find it morally wrong to kill lions, dogs, and dolphins. That is because Western moral values find connections between humans and lions, dogs, and dolphins, but do not find connections between cows, chickens, and fish, and therefore value certain species' lives over others. Which species are valued over others differs depending on culture, country, religion, etc., as can be seen in the fact that it is socially acceptable to eat dogs in many Asian cultures, but is seen as morally corrupt in most Western cultures. The lack of a universal hierarchy for nonhuman animals shows that it is a social construction created to benefit humans.

Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the killing of any animal is part of a larger system of oppression, and that instead of choosing one animal over another, or a human over a nonhuman animal, humans should care about all oppressed subjects and should be invested in ending each subject's oppression, so as to end the oppression of all beings. The creation of hierarchies in nonhuman animals can also rapidly become the creation of hierarchies in humans, and thus one can once again observe how speciesism is linked to racism, classism, sexism, and other forms of oppression.

Vegetarian ecofeminism asserts that as long as "humans are violent toward animals, they often are violent toward one another" and this "vicious circle of violence and destruction can end only if and when the human species learns to form harmonious relations – non-hierarchical and non-exploitative – with other animal species and the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=S.|year=2006|title=Rethinking Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the Left|url=|journal=Journal of Inclusive Democracy|volume=2 |issue=3|pages=1–28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetarianism==
Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women are closely linked, so vegetarian ecofeminism argues that eating meat makes one complicit in the exploitation of animals. It also makes one complicit in the violence towards animals and women, for "meat-eating is a form of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] domination ... that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The phrase "the personal is political" is deeply embedded in ecofeminism, because just as it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products created in [[sweatshop]]s, it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products produced by factory farming.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Feminist]]s recognize that buying and consuming these products, whether they are clothes made by a woman denied her [[Human rights in Cambodia]] or meat from a cow whose rights as a nonhuman animal were violated until it was killed, is an act of support to sweatshops and factory farming, but also to the larger patriarchal system at play.

It is also noted that vegetarianism can be a means to protest violence of all kinds because it believes that "animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and brutal taking of life."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarianism is therefore a way that ecofeminists can embody their beliefs, because eating meat directly supports the domination of humans over nonhumans, speciesism, and the creation of hierarchies. Or in other words, "the fact that our meat-advocating culture has successfully separated the consequence of eating animals from the experience of eating animals".&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Neal. 1990. The evolution of the human diet. ''In The power of your plate''. Summertown TN: Book Publishing Co. Web. 11 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The dairy industry acquires revenue via artificial insemination and the consequential lactating of female bodies. When their calf is born, the newborn is immediately taken from their mother. If they are a male calf, they are destined to be sold to the veal or beef industry. If they are a female calf, they are destined to live the same dairy cow life as their mothers. Vegetarians are able to empathize with nonhuman animals and reject the notion of speciesism, and their diets reflect their beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminists do the same but connect it to the larger picture of systematic oppression, and recognize that the only way that humans are able to justify their oppression of animals is to discredit the empathy and sympathy felt for nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Link between sexism and speciesism==
While the goal of vegetarian ecofeminism is to end all oppression, it does focus on the connections between the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women. Both are [[Objectification|objectified]] by men within the dominate discourse of the patriarchy, though in different ways: women are seen as sex objects and nonhuman animals are seen as food.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In both instances, both beings are considered to be less than men, and therefore are able to be used, abused, and consumed by those with more privilege.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; There are often [[essentialist]]ic and empathetic connections made between human mothers and nonhuman mothers, and ecofeminist scholar Carol Adams exemplifies this when she states "As a lactating mother, I empathize with the sow whose reproductive freedoms have been denied and whose nursing experience seems so wretched."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Generalizing women as mothers is problematic because not all women identify as mothers, yet there often is a strong link made between women and nonhuman animals due to their shared experience and oppression as mothers.

The egg, veal, and dairy industry directly profits from exploiting the reproductive system of female non-human animals. Similarly, many industries profit from objectifying, dominating, and consuming female human bodies. The advertising industry often objectifies women's bodies, as something to be dominated and consumed. Adams asserts that the culturally accepted belief that animal bodies are "disposable objects for fun or eating" emboldens the acceptance of "heterosexuality as normative and the idea that pleasuring men is women's work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Carol J.|year=2017|title=The Poetics of Christian Engagement: Living Compassionately in a Sexual Politics of Meat World|url=|journal=Studies in Christian Ethics|volume=30.1|pages=45–59|via=|doi=10.1177/0953946816674148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linking sexism and speciesism through language===
Women are often objectified by being compared to a piece of meat or [[Dehumanization|dehumanized]] by being called a 'cow' or a 'bird'.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There is indeed a history of dehumanization through equating humans to animals, which because of speciesism, means that they are devalued and considered to be less than other valued humans.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This is often seen in cases of [[genocide]], for in Rwanda the Tutsi were compared to cockroaches for many months leading up to the actual genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. J. 2006. The War on Compassion. In J. Donovan and C. J. Adams (eds) The Feminist Care Tradition in Animal Ethics. New York: Columbia University Press, 2007, pp.21–38&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing humans as animals makes it easier to oppress them, and thus it is once again clear that in order to end the oppression of humans, one must also work to end the oppression of nonhuman animals, because so long as nonhuman animals are viewed as inherently inferior to humans, dehumanization will continue to be justified with comparisons to nonhuman animals.

==Morality and ethics==
Sympathy towards nonhuman animals and recognizing that the same dominant power is abusing all of the oppressed is essential to ending all oppression because "humans have an innate sense of sympathy and that this is the basis for moral awareness",&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Donovan | first1=Josephine | year=1990| title=Animal Rights and Feminist Theory | doi=10.1086/494588 | journal=Signs | volume=15 | issue=2| pages=350–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore able to make the moral and sympathetic connections between human experiences and nonhuman experiences.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These can include the connection mothers will feel to cows being exploited for their milk, or the understanding among "people of color, women, gays, and lesbians [who] all know the experience of being hunted-of being "prey" in Western culture."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that as feminists, those who recognize the domination of the patriarchal power, should also recognize the way in which it dominates and objectifies nonhuman animals, and should therefore feel a moral obligation to end not only women's oppression, but animals' oppression as well.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===Need for justification when harming nonhuman animals===
Harming animals goes against humans' natural instincts, and language is used to hide the harm humans cause nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; In farming, the act of killing a nonhuman animal is not known as "slaughter" but as "termination" or "meat-packing" and the animals themselves are referred to as "livestock". This terminology prevents sympathy, through disconnecting the living animal from the product, and by masking the harm done to these nonhuman animals by humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Another justification for exploiting and harming animals is that it is a necessary function in order for humans to survive. This is supported by the discourse that humans must consume meat and eggs in order to be healthy, or that animal testing must be used to advance medicine.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; So while humans are naturally empathetic and caring to nonhuman animals, there are a great deal of obstacles created by "the substantial power of institutionalized animal exploitation [that] sustain ignorance, promote fear, reward cruelty, and punish kindness."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; These obstacles are deeply ingrained in many societies and thus social justice for nonhuman animals is often difficult to obtain.

==The feminist–vegetarian connection==
''The feminist–vegetarian connection'' first appeared in Sheri Lucas' "A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection", a response to Kathryn Paxton George's book ''Animal, Vegetable, or Woman? A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism (2000)''. The feminist–vegetarian connection is a concept indicating that the oppression of animals in the form of being slaughtered and consumed is parallel to the oppression of women in a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], which establishes a connection between feminism and vegetarianism.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Sheri|year=2005|title=A defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection|url=|journal=Hypatia|volume=20|pages=150–177|doi=10.1353/hyp.2005.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol. J. Adams first published on this topic in 1975.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; However, this topic was mentioned in 'few publications' for ten years afterwards.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The lack of acknowledgment on this topic in the 1980s became a concern amongst feminists and, eventually, triggered the formation of an 'Ecofeminist Task Force' in 1990, raising awareness on the feminist–vegetarian connection.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; After 1990, this connection was extensively analysed in articles and journals by numerous scholars such as [[Josephine Donovan]] and Kathryn Paxton George.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

==Voices in opposition to the feminist–vegetarian connection==

===Health of men and women on vegetarian and vegan diets===
In ''Animal, Vegetable, or Woman,'' Kathryn Paxton George invalidates the oppression of nonhuman animals, which is "inconsistent with feminism or antithetical to its goals" in her opinion.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; George argues in her essay "Should Feminists be Vegetarians" that "these traditional arguments for ethical vegetarianism cannot be assimilated into a feminist ethic. Correlatively, limited consumption of animal products and, in some cases, meat is consistent with a feminist ethic".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Kathryn Paxton|year=1994|title=Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?|url=|journal=Signs|volume=19|issue=2|pages=405–434|doi=10.1086/494889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George's stance is based on human beings' physiology that conditions male to be more likely to succeed on a vegetarian diet than female.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; According to George, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet poses risks on "people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Based on George's scientific research, she discovered that women and children "are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministcurrent.com/2011/12/18/should-feminists-be-vegetarian/|title=PODCAST: Should Feminists be Vegetarians?|last=Murphy|first=Meghan|date=18 December 2011|website=Feminist Current|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially children who adopt a vegan diet "may lack sufficient quantities of vitamin D and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, iron, calcium, and zinc".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; George claims that "milk is still recommended as the best source of calcium" as calcium in plants "either comes in a form the body cannot use very well or occurs in the presence of other compounds (such as phytates, fiber, cellulose, uronic acids, and oxalates in the case of calcium) that prevent its use".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Furthermore, lactating and gestating women may be at 'greater nutritional risk' which may negatively influence the health of the fetus or infant.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In addition, George claims that "even [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|lacto-ovovegetarian]] diet poses some risks".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Along with children and women, people from developing countries where resources and education about taking iron and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements are not available can also be under the risk of iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===The male ideal===
To further support the argument, George claims that the research on plant-based nutrition was "done almost entirely on men" to support the statement that one does not need to eat animal products for good health.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In George's opinion, the potential health risks brought by a vegetarian or vegan diet are "rare for Western adult males, for whom the ideal is best suited".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Also, "the nutritional evidence suggests that the best candidates for vegetarianism, and for veganism in particular, are young, healthy adult males" because they do not have the nutritional stress "from feeding a rapidly growing fetus nor are they unduly stressed by their own growth requirements, as most of their growth is accomplished".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In general, good health can be achieved and maintained on a vegetarian or vegan diet by privileged people who are "adult [20–50-year-old] male, non-allergic, healthy, well-educated, middle or upper class individual or upper class female unable to bear children".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal, Vegetable, or Woman?: A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism|last=George|first=Kathryn Paxton|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Albany, New York, United States|pages=16–197|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone else who does not fall into the category of those privileged people is "''physiologically'' barred" from both maintaining health and "being fully moral" of not consuming animals.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

In ''A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection,'' Lucas summarizes George's arguments on healthy vegetarian and vegan diets as diets that "[requires] access to fortified foods, supplements, a dietitian, and many other advantages".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Therefore, an "ecofeminist dilemma" arises in the form that "the entire human population cannot enjoy health on vegetarian diets unless an environmental dire spread of industrialization occurs".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; According to George, even if fortified foods and supplements are already incorporated into one's diet, the risk of supplementation still takes its toll on people's health due to "the possibility of toxicity, low availability, and interactions among supplements".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===Vegetarianism and veganism not as feminist ideals===
According to George, there are two "minimum conceptions of a feminist ethics": "First, no ethics can permit arbitrariness in its prescriptions and theories," and, "Second, any specific feminist ethic must affirm the value of the female body".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Thus, for George, "any feminist ethic must reject (1) requiring women to live as if physiologically the same as men and (2) placing arbitrary burdens upon females that males do not have to bear".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, in order to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, women are required "to accept these burdens rather than reject them".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Therefore, this requirement upon women causes vegetarianism and veganism to "hardly be a feminist ideal".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Instead, George thinks that semivegetarianism best embraces "the value of health" and that "it would be more productive ... to improve conditions for animals and to urge truly balanced diets that are not excessive".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

==Voices in support of the feminist–vegetarian connection==

===Food choices and gender identification===
Some scholars such as [[Carol J. Adams]] and [[Josephine Donovan]] support the feminist–vegetarian connection. In ''The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory'', Adams establishes "the cross-mapping between feminism and vegetarianism" through an in-depth analysis of gender identification embedded in people's food choices.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory|last=Adams|first=Carol J|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York, United States|pages=xxxiv–193|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a patriarchal society, "meat is constant for men, intermittent for women".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For example, {{"'}}Ethiopian women and girls of all classes are obliged to prepare two meals, one for the males and a second, often containing no meat or other substantial protein, for the females{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Also, women who prepare to be pregnant are told that "one should eat meat (or fish, vegetables, chocolate, and salt) at least six weeks before becoming pregnant if one wants a boy. But if a girl is desired, no meat please, rather milk, cheese, nuts, beans, and cereals".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Additionally, there are cultural food taboos that concern meat consumption based on gender; women are commonly forbidden to have "chicken, duck, and pork" and also "fish, seafood, and eggs" in some Asian countries.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Only "vegetables and other nonmeat foods are viewed as women's food".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, gender identification is heavily associated with the eating of animals; meat-eating links with masculinity while vegetable-eating suggests "emasculation or femininity".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; This gender-based reading of meat-eating is further accentuated by "[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s notion of [[Phallogocentrism|carnophallogocentrism]]," indicating that "masculinity and carnivorism work together to support the virility, power, and authority of one who argues, dialogues, and speaks reasonably".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malatino|first=Hilary|year=2011|title=Carnophallogocentrism and the Sexual Politics of Meat|url=|journal=Journal of Critical Animal Studies|volume=9|pages=128–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Links between women and animals===
Adams also argues that animals and women are linked through "fused oppressions" as "we oppress animals by associating them with women's lesser status".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Examples include the use of different gender pronouns based on whether an animal poses as having "''a major power'' (he) or ''a minor power'' (she)".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In this case, ''a major power'' refers to {{"'}}an active power and a possible danger to the speaker{{'"}} while ''a minor power'' refers to the power {{"'}}as a potential prey, a power that has to be destroyed{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Adams further explains that "'she' represents not only a 'minor power', but a vanished power, a soon-to-be-killed powerless animal".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Through Adams' analysis, a female-gendered pronoun becomes an indicator of the oppressed, "representing the violated victim of male violence".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, women and animals are linked through "a shared and co-constitutive mechanism of oppression that manifests linguistically, particularly through metaphor".&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In addition, Adams indicates that people exploits animals' "femaleness" through the consumption of female animals such as hens and cows as well as their by-products such as eggs and dairy.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In the [[meat industry]], slaughters are told not to slaughter female animals "in the advanced stage of pregnancy" because "the physiological condition of the female is disturbed and the flesh is not normal".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Conclusively, Adams states that "the text of the body upon whom we write the fate of being meat is symbolically if not predominantly female".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Furthermore, Adams argues that the links between women and animals are reinforced "through a structure of the absent referent".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For instance, animals whose flesh is called "meat" become "absent referent" through butchering;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; by renaming dead bodies as meat, people "do not conjured dead, butchered animals, but cuisine".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  On the other hand, Women also becomes absent in the language about sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For example, the term "[[rape]]" is used metaphorically to depict other devastating violent incidents, such as {{"'}}rape' of the earth in ecological writing of the early 1970s{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In this case, the experiences of women are recalled "as a vehicle for explicating another being's oppression" yet women themselves are absent.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to Adams, violence against both women and animals in the form of "sexual violence and meat eating ... find a point of intersection in the absent referent; ... if animals are the absent referent in the phrase 'the butchering of women', women are the absent referent in the phrase 'the rape of animals{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminism brings to light the interconnecting oppressions of women and animals within the patriarchal hierarchy. One primary issue that feminists address is autonomy over their bodies, independent and free from control from the church and the state. Vegan ecofeminist [[Marti Kheel]] contends that "the lack of control that women have over their reproductive capacity in patriarchal society is magnified on factory farms where female cows are kept in a continual state of lactation, and where rape racks are routinely used to impregnate female animals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheel|first=Marti|year=2005|title=Toppling Patriarchy with a Fork: the Feminist Debate Over Meat|url=|journal=Pacific Division of the Society for Women in Philosophy Conference|volume=|pages=1–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliance between feminism and vegetarianism===
After acknowledging the connections amongst vegetable-eating, women, and animals, Adams proposes that "not only was vegetarianism a logical enacting of a moral viewpoint, but it also resonated with feminist theory and female experience".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to ethicist Beverly Harrison, feminists must be with their bodies and acknowledge that all their knowledge, including their moral one, is 'body-mediated knowledge'; disconnecting from their bodies would result in the destruction of 'possibility of moral relations' amongst feminists.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  Adams further asserts that "ethical vegetarianism is a theory people enact with their bodies" as "vegetarians identify a connection between a healthy body and a diet that honors the moral relations between us and other animals".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; From a biological point of view, Adams supports the arguments that humans have bodies of herbivores as opposed to those of carnivores due to the biological evidences from humans' "teeth, saliva, stomach acids, and length of the intestines".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, vegetarianism and feminism are connected through the predominant involvement of one's body. Veganism is a method of rejection to partaking in the oppression of animals in a patriarchal culture.

===Other voices and evidences supporting the feminist–vegetarian connection===
Through evidences from several nutritional studies that prove the health benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets, Donovan explicitly proclaims that "yes, feminists should be vegetarians" one year after the publication of George's article "Should Feminists be Vegetarians?" in 1994.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donovan|first=Josephine|year=1994|title=Comment on George's "Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?"|url=|journal=Signs|volume=21|pages=226–229|doi=10.1086/495062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan quotes "Nutritional Consequences of Vegetarianism" that {{"'}}with appropriate attention to nutritional needs, the health consequences of vegetarianism itself are neutral and in some respects may even be positive{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Based on nutritional studies done in 1994, she also quotes that "infant, children, adolescents, and pregnant women have ... special needs ... vegan diets can safely be used by these groups if foods, and in some instances, supplements, are selected which provide a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet ... In many cases, vegan diets offer health benefits".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Donovan also claims that "most non-Western diets are largely vegetarian" and meat-eating, as a 'Western norm', is imposed on non-Western countries through 'Western cultural imperialism'.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Moreover, according to Lucas, "in the West, nearly all of the available flesh, milk products, and eggs are the output of cruel, violet, and wasteful practices".&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; By extension, purchasing and consuming any animal products directly supports cruelty.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Such evidences disproving the potential biological and environmental harm caused by vegetarianism accentuates the necessity of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet while being a feminist. According to Donovan, "feminism must take a stand against animal suffering and exploitation, including human consumption of meat".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

==Praxis==

===Activism===
While vegetarian ecofeminism is at its core an academic field, its main principles and ideas – eradicating all oppression by including speciesism and emphasizing the link between speciesism and sexism – can be transferred from theory into action through activism. Activism can take many forms, one of the most common and achievable being the power of boycotting products that support the exploitation and abuse of women and/or animals.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; For example, vegetarian ecofeminists might boycott products that were created in sweatshops and therefore exploited women, or products that were tested on animals or that were created by killing animals and therefore exploited nonhuman animals. The act of being a vegetarian or a vegan is itself a form of boycotting, for it choosing not to consume products that were created at the expense of killing or abusing nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Even at the Ecofeminist Task Force of the National Women's Studies Association suggested that no animal products should be served the 1990 NWSA meeting or at future conferences due to ecological and humane issues.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminist might put their beliefs into practice by participating in demonstrations, as was seen at the 1990 March for the Animals in Washington, D.C., when ecofeminists carried a banner showing their support of recognizing how the domination of humans over nonhumans animals fits into ecofeminism, but also feminism in general.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Key thinkers==
Since vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the larger academic field of ecofeminism, the most significant thinkers of vegetarian ecofeminism are part of both, but one of their focuses is connecting the domination of women to the domination of nonhuman animals, and understanding how animal liberation fits into ecofeminism.

[[Greta Gaard]] is one of the main thinkers within ecofeminism in general, but especially within vegetarian ecofeminism. Aside from being an activist and a writer, she is also a professor at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. Her essay entitled "Vegetarian Ecofeminism" speaks to many of the key concepts within the field, including the importance of including speciesism in ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[Carol J. Adams]], both a vegetarian ecofeminist writer and activist, has spent over twenty years writing about ecofeminism, focusing on the importance of connecting speciesism to sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sister Species: Women, Animals, and Social Justice|last=Kemmerer|first=Lisa|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her article entitled "Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals" is an essential work to the field, and draws upon the importance of not consuming meat as an ecofeminist. Another one of her major works is "The Sexual Politics of Meat", which once again examines major themes in vegetarian ecofeminism.

{{Lowercase title}}
[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Embryology theories of [[Ernst Haeckel]] (following [[Johann Friedrich Meckel|Meckel]]) and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] compared. Von Baer denied any recapitulation of whole adult forms, though individual structures might be recapitulated.]]
'''Von Baer's laws of embryology''' (or '''laws of development''') are four rules discovered by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] to explain the observed pattern of [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] in different species.&lt;ref name=abz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abzhanov|first1=Arhat|title=von Baer's law for the ages: lost and found principles of developmental evolution |journal=Trends in Genetics|date=2013|volume=29|issue=12|pages=712–722|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.004|pmid=24120296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Baer formulated the laws in the book ''Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere'' ("''On the Developmental History of Animals''"), published in 1828, while working at the [[University of Königsberg]]. He specifically intended to rebut [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s 1808 [[recapitulation theory]]. According to that theory, embryos pass through successive stages that represent the adult forms of less complex organisms in the course of development, and that ultimately reflects ''scala naturae'' (the [[great chain of being]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Baer believed that such linear development is impossible. He posited that instead of linear progression, embryos started from one or a few basic forms that are similar in different animals, and then developed in a branching pattern into increasingly different organisms. Defending his ideas, he was also opposed to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[Natural selection|common ancestry and descent with modification]], and particularly to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s revised recapitulation theory with its slogan "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |authorlink=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922|volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovtrup |first1=Soren |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348 |doi=10.2307/2412887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The laws==

Von Baer's laws are a series of statements generally summarised into four points. As translated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in his ''Scientific Memoirs'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Thomas Henry |authorlink=Thomas Huxley |editor1-last=Henfrey |editor1-first=Arthur |title=Scientific memoirs, selected from the transactions of foreign academies of science, and from foreign journals. Natural history |year=1853 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.28029 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/70597#page/186/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The more general characters of a large group appear earlier in the embryo than the more special characters.
# From the most general forms the less general are developed, and so on, until finally the most special arises.
# Every embryo of a given animal form, instead of passing through the other forms, rather becomes separated from them.
# The embryo of a higher form never resembles any other form, but only its embryo.

==Description==

Von Baer discovered the [[blastula]] (the early hollow ball stage of an embryo) and the development of the [[notochord]] (the stiffening rod along the back of all [[chordate]]s, that forms after the blastula and [[gastrula]] stages). From his observations of these stages in different vertebrates, he realised that [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] must be wrong. For example, he noticed that the [[yolk sac]] is found in [[bird]]s, but not in [[frog]]s. According to the recapitulation theory, such structures should invariably be present in frogs because they were assumed to be at a lower level in the evolutionary tree. Von Baer concluded that while structures like the notochord are recapitulated during embryogenesis, whole organisms are not.&lt;ref name="matthen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthen |first1=Mohan |last2=Stephens |first2=Christopher |title=Philosophy of Biology |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-080-47124-2 |pages=444–445 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bVww2ZPO258C&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that (as translated):

{{quote|The embryo successively adds the organs that characterize the animal classes in the ascending scale. When the human embryo, for instance, is but a simple vesicle, it is an infusorian; when it has gained a liver, it is a mussel; with the appearance of the osseous system, it enters the class of fishes; and so forth, until it becomes a mammal and then a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ospovat |first1=D. |title=The influence of Karl Ernst von Baer's embryology, 1828–1859: A reappraisal in light of Richard Owen's and William B. Carpenter's "Palaeontological application of 'von Baer's law'" |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |year=1976 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1007/BF00129171}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of taxonomic hierarchy, according to von Baer, characters in the embryo are formed in top-to-bottom sequence, first from those of the largest and oldest taxon, the [[phylum]], then in turn class, order, family, genus, and finally species.&lt;ref name="matthen"/&gt;

==Reception==

The laws received a mixed appreciation. While they were criticised in detail, they formed the foundation of modern [[embryology]].&lt;ref name=abz/&gt; The British zoologist [[Adam Sedgwick (zoologist)|Adam Sedgwick]] studied the developing embryos of [[Squalus|dogfish]] and [[chicken]], and in 1894 noted a series of differences, such as the green yolk in the dogfish and yellow yolk in the chicken, absence of embryonic rim in chick embryos, absence of [[blastopore]] in dogfish, and differences in the gill slits and gill clefts. He concluded:

{{quote|There is no stage of development in which the unaided eye would fail to distinguish between them with ease... A blind man could distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sedgwick |first1=Adam |authorlink=Adam Sedgwick (zoologist) |title=Memoirs: On the Law of Development commonly known as von Baer's Law; and on the Significance of Ancestral Rudiments in Embryonic Development |journal=Journal of Cell Science |date=1894 |volume=s2-36 |pages=35–52 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s2-36/141/35}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most important supporter of von Baer's laws was Charles Darwin, who wrote in his ''[[Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|[The] adult [animal] differs from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |title=On the Origin of Species |date=1859 |publisher=John Murray|location=London |page=338 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Darwin took up the concept of common descent which formed part of his theory of evolution. But von Baer was a vociferous anti-Darwinist, devoting much of his scholarly effort to criticising Darwinism. His criticism culminated with his last work ''Über Darwins Lehre'' ("''On Darwin's Doctrine''"), published in the year of his death in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vucinich |first1=Alexander |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-52-006283-3 |page=93 |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5290063h&amp;chunk.id=d0e2212&amp;toc.id=d0e2205&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Health Organisation Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)''' is a structured interview for psychiatric disorders. As the interview is designed for [[epidemiological studies]], it can be administered by those who are not clinically trained and can be completed in a short amount of time. Versions of the CIDI were used in two important studies, the [[National Comorbidity Survey]] (NCS)&lt;ref name="NCS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blazer |first1=DG |last2=Kessler |first2=RC |last3=McGonagle |first3=KA |last4=Swartz |first4=MS |name-list-format=vanc |date=July 1994 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/151/7/979 |url-access=subscription |title=The prevalence and distribution of major depression in a national community sample: The National Comorbidity Survey |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=7 |pages=979-86 |pmid=8010383 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.7.979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

which are often used as a reference for estimates of the rates of psychiatric illness in the USA.
The first version of the CIDI was published in 1988,&lt;ref name="CIDI"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lee N. |last1=Robins |first2=John |last2=Wing |first3=Hans Ulrich |last3=Wittchen |first4=John E. |last4=Helzer |first5=Thomas F. |last5=Babor |first6=Jay |last6=Burke |first7=Anne |last7=Farmer |first8=Assen |last8=Jablenski |first9=Roy |last9=Pickens |first10=Darrel A. |last10=Regier |first11=Norman |last11=Sartorius |first12=Leland H. |last12=Towle |name-list-format=vanc |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/45/12/1069 |url-access=subscription |title=The Composite International Diagnostic Interview: An Epidemiologic Instrument Suitable for Use in Conjunction With Different Diagnostic Systems and in Different Cultures |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=1069-1077 |date=December 1988 |pmid=2848472 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800360017003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been periodically updated to reflect the changing diagnostic criteria of [[DSM-IV|DSM]] and [[ICD-10|ICD]].

The '''Composite International Diagnostic Interview – Short Form''' ('''CIDI-SF''') was first published by [[Ronald C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6773">'''Zoosadism''' is [[pleasure]] derived from [[cruelty to animals]]. It is part of the [[Macdonald triad]], a set of three behaviors that are considered a precursor to [[Psychopathy|psychopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M. MacDonald|title=The Threat to Kill|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=120|issue=2|pages=125–130|year=1963|doi=10.1176/ajp.120.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Some studies have suggested that individuals who are [[cruel to animals]] are more likely to be violent to humans. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{cquote|The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appear in its computer records of [[Serial rape|serial rapists]] and [[Serial killer|murderers]], and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals as a diagnostic criterion for [[conduct disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Child's Love of Cruelty May Hint at the Future Killer | newspaper = New York Times | pages = | year = | date = 7 August 1991 | url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Helen Gavin wrote however in ''Criminological and Forensic Psychology'' (2013):

{{cquote|This is not a universal trait, though. [[Dennis Nilsen]] had difficulty initiating social contact with people, but loved his faithful companion, Bleep, a mongrel bitch. After his arrest, he was very concerned for her welfare, as she was taken to the police station too.&lt;ref name="Helen Gavin 2013 120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Gavin|title=Criminological and Forensic Psychology|pages=120|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alan R. Felthous reported in his paper "Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People" (1980):

{{cquote|A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well, including one patient who had murdered a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Felthous | first = Alan R. | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 10 | pages = 169–177 | date = | year = 1980 | url = | doi = 10.1007/bf01433629| id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a commonly reported finding, and for this reason, [[cruelty to animals]] is often considered a warning sign of potential violence towards humans.

==Legal status==
In the [[United States]], since 2010, it has been a federal offense to create or distribute "obscene" depictions of "living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians ... subjected to serious bodily injury".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruthann Robson|Robson, Ruthann]] (2010-12-14) [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html Animal Porn - Criminalized by Federal Law Again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415045939/http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html |date=2011-04-15 }}, ''Constitutional Law Prof Blog''&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced an overly broad 1999 statute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|title=18 U.S. Code § 48 - Animal crush videos|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121143325/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found unconstitutional in ''[[United States v.

==Criticism of alleged link to violence against humans==
Critics of the concept of a propensity for cruelty to humans cite the fact that animals can be cruel to some animals yet caring to other animals, combined with [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s studies using metronomes at different rates to test conditioned learning showing that humans can discriminate in fine ways that animals cannot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Catania, A.C.|year=1994|title=Query: Did Pavlov's research ring a bell?|journal=Psycoloquy Newsletter, June 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conclude that there is no such general basis. The exact way these critics explain studies that seems to show links varies, but most of them state that psychiatric and criminological studies are subject to [[institutional bias]] and [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill, 2002 RobertWhitaker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique by Lieberman, P 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is also pointed out that [[correlation does not prove causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|title=The Case for Animal Experimentation: An Evolutionary and Ethical Perspective|first=Michael Allen|last=Fox|date=23 April 1986|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=23 April 2018|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032616/https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|archivedate=5 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Piers Beirne]], a professor of [[criminology]] at the [[University of Southern Maine]], has criticized existing studies for ignoring socially accepted practices of violence against animals, such as [[animal slaughter]] and [[vivisection]], that might be linked to violence against humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021521/http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
