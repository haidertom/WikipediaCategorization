      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26568">'''''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy''''' is an [[ANSI|American National Standard]] published by [[ASHRAE]] that establishes the ranges of indoor environmental conditions to achieve acceptable [[thermal comfort]] for occupants of buildings. It was first published in 1966, and since 2004 has been updated every three to six years. The most recent version of the standard was published in 2017.

== Organization of standard ==
The body of the standard consists of a foreword (describing changes made in the current version), eight sections and two normative appendices:
# Purpose
# Scope
# Definitions
# General requirements
# Conditions that provide thermal comfort
# Design compliance
# Evaluation of comfort in existing buildings
# References
: Normative Appendix A: Methods for determining operative temperature
: Normative Appendix B: Computer program for calculation of [[Thermal comfort#PMV/PPD method|PMV/PPD]]

After the body of the standard there are 11 informative appendices. These are not part of the standard, but provide additional information about terms and methods described within the standard, as well as a bibliography, and a description of the addenda incorporated from the previous version in the current version.&lt;ref name="55_2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2013 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
As described within the standard: "The purpose of the standard is to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space".&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

== Scope ==
The standard addresses the four primary environmental factors ([[temperature]], [[thermal radiation]], [[humidity]], and [[Thermal comfort#Air speed|air speed]]) and two personal factors ([[Thermal comfort#Metabolic rate|activity]] and [[Thermal comfort#Clothing insulation|clothing]]) that affect [[thermal comfort]].  It is applicable for healthy adults at atmospheric pressures in altitudes up to (or equivalent to) {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and for indoor spaces designed for occupancy of at least 15 minutes.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

=== Adaptive model ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#Adaptive comfort model}}
Adaptive model is a model that relates indoor design temperatures or acceptable temperature ranges to outdoor meteorological or climatological parameters.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Thermal comfort ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#thermal comfort}}
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces ===
A occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space is where the thermal conditions of the space are primarily regulated by occupant-controlled openings.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Predicted mean vote (PMV) ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#PMV/PPD method}}
Predicted mean vote is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self-reported perceptions) of a large group of persons on a sensation scale expressed from -3 to +3 corresponding to the categories "cold," "cool," "slightly cool," "neutral," "slight warm," "warm," and "hot."&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Comfort zone ===
Comfort zone refers to the combinations of air temperature, mean radiant temperature (tr), and humidity that are predicted to be an acceptable thermal environment at particular values of air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation (I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Clothing insulation (I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
{{Further |Thermal comfort #Clothing insulation}}
Clothing insulation is the resistance to sensible heat transfer provided by a clothing ensemble (expressed in units of clo, which is a unit to quantify the insulation provided by garments and clothing ensembles. 1 ''clo'' = 0.155&amp;nbsp;m²&amp;nbsp;°C/W (0.88&amp;nbsp;ft²·h·°F/Btu))&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Metabolic rate (met) ===
{{Further |Thermal comfort #Metabolic rate}}
Metabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual, per unit of skin surface are (expressed in units of met) equal to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²), which is the energy produced per unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest.

=== Exceedance hours ===
Exceedance hour is the number of occupied hours within a defined time period in which the environmental conditions in an occupied space are outside the comfort zone.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Methods to evaluate thermal comfort ==

=== Graphic comfort zone method ===
The graphic method utilizes an overlay on a [[Psychrometrics#Psychrometric charts|psychrometric chart]] to indicate the [[operative temperature]]s and [[humidity]] at which [[thermal comfort]] is achieved in the winter (1.0 ''clo'') and summer (0.5 ''clo'').  It is based on the [[Thermal comfort#PMV.2FPPD method|Predicted Mean Vote]] (PMV) model.&lt;ref name = "Fanger1970"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fanger|first1=P.O.|title=Thermal Comfort|date=1970|publisher=Danish Technical Press|location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic comfort zone model is limited in applicability to conditions when the [[Thermal comfort#Metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] of occupants is 1.0-1.3 met and the [[Humidity#Absolute humidity|humidity ratio]] is below 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/kg dry air (0.012&amp;nbsp;lb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/lb dry air).  If these requirements are met and the environmental conditions inside the building fall within the indicated ranges, then compliance is achieved.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Analytical comfort zone method ===
For humidity ratios above 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/kg dry air (0.012&amp;nbsp;lb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/lb dry air), or for metabolic rates up to 2.0 met, the analytical model must be used to determine thermal comfort sensation.  Also based on the PMV model, this method uses tools such as the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool or the online [[Center for the Built Environment|CBE]] Thermal Comfort Tool&lt;ref name = "Hoytetal_2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool |title=CBE Thermal Comfort Tool |last1=Hoyt |first1=Tyler |last2=Schiavon |first2=Stefano |last3=Piccioli |first3=Alberto |last4=Moon |first4=Dustin |last5=Steinfeld |first5=Kyle |year=2013 |publisher=[[Center for the Built Environment]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evaluate thermal comfort.  Users provide [[operative temperature]] (or air temperature and [[mean radiant temperature]]), air speed, humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation value, and the tool evaluates predicted thermal sensation on a scale from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Compliance is achieved if the conditions provide thermal neutrality, measured as falling between -0.5 and +0.5 on the PMV scale.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Elevated air speed ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#Elevated air speed method}}
The section sets provisions for increasing the upper air temperature limit at elevated air speeds above {{convert|0.20|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}}.  The methodology is based on the SET (Standard Effective Temperature) model, which provides a way to assign an effective temperature (at a standard metabolic rate, and clothing insulation values) to compare thermal sensations experienced at a range of thermal conditions.&lt;ref name = "NishiGagge_1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishi|first1=Y|last2=Gagge|first2=A.P.|title=Effective temperature scale useful for hypo-and hyperbaric environments|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=1977|volume=48|issue=2|pages=97–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper limit of air speed is based on whether occupants have local control or not.  To evaluate compliance, the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool may be used, or a computer model validated against the code provided in Informative Appendix G of the standard.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Local thermal discomfort ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#Local thermal discomfort}}
 
Radiant temperature asymmetry between ceiling and floor, and air and walls must be limited to reduce discomfort.  To reduce draft risk at temperatures below {{convert|22.5|C|F}}, air speed due to the HVAC system must be {{convert|0.15|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}} or below.  The vertical air temperature difference between ankle and head is limited to {{convert|3|C-change|F-change}} for seated occupants and {{convert|4|C-change|F-change}} for standing occupants.&lt;ref name=ashrae2013_a&gt;{{cite web|title=Addendum a to Standard 55-2013|url=https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/StdsAddenda/55_2013_a_Final.pdf|website=ASHRAE|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If occupants' feet will be in contact with the floor, the temperature must be {{convert|19|-|29|C}}.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Temperature variations with time ===
When occupants do not have control over the cyclical variation or drifts in indoor environmental conditions, the conditions within this section must be met.  Operative temperatures may not fluctuate more than {{convert|1.1|C-change|F-change}} within 15 minutes, nor change more than {{convert|2.2|C-change|F-change}} within 1 hour.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Acceptable thermal conditions in occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces ===
This method, also known as the [[Thermal comfort#Adaptive comfort model|adaptive comfort model]], is applicable in buildings without mechanical cooling (and no operating heating system) where occupants’ met rates are 1.0-1.3 met and their clothing levels are 0.5-1.0 ''clo''.  For this model the standard provides a graph of acceptable indoor temperature limits at prevailing mean outdoor temperatures (a mean of the daily mean outdoor temperatures of the previous 7–30 days).  An accompanying table lists provisions for higher operative temperatures at air speeds above {{convert|0.3|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|1.2|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}}. The graph is valid for prevailing mean temperatures between {{convert|10|-|33.5|C}}.  It provides 80% and 90% acceptability ranges, indicating the percentage of occupants expected to be comfortable at the indicated indoor and prevailing mean outdoor temperatures.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Demonstrating design compliance ==
This section of the standard is applicable for the design of buildings.  All of the building systems must be designed to maintain the occupied spaces at the indoor conditions specified by one of the described evaluation methods at design conditions.  The systems must be able to maintain these conditions within the expected range of indoor and outdoor operating conditions.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

To demonstrate compliance the following must be documented, where applicable.  Sample documentation is provided in Informative Appendix J.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;
* Method of compliance (e.g. Graphic Comfort Zone Method)
* Design operative temperature and humidity, heating and cooling design outdoor conditions, total indoor loads, and design exceedance hours
* Assumed values for environmental factors (operative temperature, humidity, and average air speed) and personal factors (clothing insulation and metabolic rate) for heating and cooling design conditions; spaces where personal factors are outside the specified limits should be indicated as not within the standard’s scope
* A description of how local thermal discomfort will be addressed, including calculation methods, inputs and results
* System equipment capacities for each space demonstrating that thermal loads will be met under heating and cooling design conditions
* Where occupant-controlled elevated air speed is provided, a description of control type
* Air speed, radiant temperature asymmetry, vertical radiant temperature asymmetry, surface temperatures, and temperature variations in time must be calculated per engineering industry standards (e.g. Chapter 57 of the [[ASHRAE Handbook]]-HVAC Applications)

== Evaluation of comfort in existing buildings ==
Although the ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' does not require the evaluation of comfort in existing building, this part of the standard offers a guideline of performing an evaluation when one is required from other codes or standard. Generally, the evaluation of comfort in existing buildings can be performed from two perspectives: from occupant satisfaction survey and physical environmental measurements.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Measurement methods ===

==== Occupant Survey ====
Indoor thermal comfort can be determined from the responses of the occupant survey. The survey shall be distributed to the entire occupancy or representative part of the occupancy. The standard suggests that if the surveys were distributed to more than 45 occupants, the response rate must exceed 35%. If that number is between 20 and 45, the minimum number of responses is 15. When the number is under 20, at least 16 must reply for the survey to make the survey representative.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

For satisfaction surveys, the thermal satisfaction scale shall end with choices: "very satisfied" and "very dissatisfied", and, also, the occupants should be allowed to explain their dissatisfaction by answering an open-ended question. As for point-in-time surveys, the survey should be solicited during the time of occupancy, and the satisfaction scale ought to be continuous. There should be at least seven points on the scale ending with "very acceptable" and "very unacceptable." The standard also specifies that when asking thermal sensation questions, the scale should be "cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm, and hot." &lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

==== Physical measurements ====
For mechanically conditioned spaces, the PMV-based comfort zone has to be determined, which includes measuring and recording the metabolic activity and clothing insulation. The comfort zone boundaries must be adjusted to the air movements, and the zone conditions should be adjusted to avoid local thermal discomfort. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the adaptive model shall be used to determine the thermal comfort boundaries. For such spaces, the indoor and outdoor air temperature and mean radiant temperature and the air speed need to be measured.&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' provides guideline on the position, time, and equipment accuracy of the physical measurement. The measurement locations should be where the occupants are expected to spend time in. If there are multiple such locations, the measurement can be performed at a representative location.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt; In cases that the optimal representative location cannot be found, the standard suggests specific locations in the space.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

For seating occupants, the air temperature and air speed measurements shall be taken at heights of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.1 m (4, 24, and 43 in.), and operative temperature and PMV shall be measured at 0.6 m (24 in.). The heights need to be adjusted for standing persons. Local discomfort caused by radiant temperature asymmetry shall be measured at occupants’ locations, with the sensors oriented to catch the maximum surface temperature differences.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

The standard suggests that the time of measurements should last two or more hours long, and it should also be a representative time of the year for this specific building. Measuring time step should be no more than five minutes for air temperature, mean radiant temperature, and humidity, and no more than three minutes for the air speed.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

In order to achieve acceptable results, the standard also suggests the minimum equipment accuracy based the current industry standard.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

When extracting environmental data from the Building Administration System, one should evaluate the location, height, and time step of the sensors based on the previous suggestion.&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

=== Evaluation methods ===

==== Occupant Survey ====
To evaluate the probability of satisfaction from satisfaction surveys, the standard suggests dividing the number of the votes falling between "just satisfied" and "very satisfied" by the total number of votes in that questions. The answers of open-ended questions from "very dissatisfied" occupants should be documented for later analysis.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt; For point-in-time surveys, the comfort evaluation shall be performed by dividing the number of votes between -1 and +3 by the total number of votes. One has to keep in mind that the results from point-in-time surveys are only effective during the time when the surveys were solicited.&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

==== Physical measurements ====
The measured results should be evaluated against the adjusted comfort zone for the specific building. There are two cases when evaluating thermal comfort: at a specific time or over a period of time. For a mechanically conditioned space at an instance in time, the PMV and SET model shall be used to establish the comfort zone, and the local thermal discomfort shall be evaluated against the limit posed this standard as well. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces, the measured results shall be check with the comfort zone established by adaptive model.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

To evaluate the thermal comfort over a period of time in a mechanically conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of all the hours when the absolute value of PMV is greater than 0.5. For an occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of hours when the operative temperature falls outside of the lower and upper boundaries of the comfort zone.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Appendix D: Use the metabolic rate data ==
Metabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual. It is defined as per unit of skin surface area which equals to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²). This is the energy produced from a unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' provides a table of metabolic rate of different continuous activities. These values are valid for an average adult with surface skin area of 1.8 m² (19.6&amp;nbsp;ft²). The standard reminds the users that they should use their own judgment to match the activities being considered to the comparable activities in the table. Except sedentary activities, metabolic rate for all other activities is likely to have range of variation. This variation is depending on the individual performing the task and his/her environment.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

When the duration of an activity is equal or less than one hour, one can use a time-weighted metabolic rate. As metabolic rates increase over 1.0 met, the evaporation of the sweat becomes an increasingly important factor, and the PMV method does not fully account for this factor.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Appendix E: Clothing insulation ==
Clothing insulation refers to the heat transfer of the entire body, which includes the uncovered parts, such as hands and heads. There is a variety of means to determine the insulation provided by clothing. Accurate data from the measurement using thermal manikins is acceptable. When such measurement is not feasible, this standard provides four methods to determine the clothing insulation. It is also specified that the methods provided by this standard are no longer valid when the clothing insulation exceed 1.5 ''clo''. And it is also not valid when occupants wear clothing that is highly impermeable to moisture transport.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;
The first method is the least accurate, according to ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'', and the accuracy increases in order of the methods.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

First, one can estimate the clothing insulation from the table provided in section five. If the clothing ensemble in question reasonably matches the clothing ensemble in the table, the indicated value can be used. The second method is to add or subtract individual garment clo value to achieve the clothing ensemble in question. Section five of the ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' provides a table with clothing insulation of a variety of individual garments. This table can be used together with the previous one, so that one can add or subtract the clothing ensemble from the ''clo'' value of each garment. The third method is to add all the ''clo'' value of each garment to match the clothing ensemble in question.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

The fourth method described in ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' can be used to determine the clothing insulation in mechanically conditioned spaces. This method is based on the concept that when occupants choose their clothing according to their environment, the outdoor environment is more influential than the indoor one. There is a figure in the section five of the standard which predicts the representative clothing insulation of the occupants as a function of the average outdoor [[thermal comfort#Air temperature|air temperature]] at 06:00 am. The function line has four segments: the average outdoor air temperature is below {{convert|-5.0|C|F}}, between {{convert|-5.0|C|F}} and {{convert|5.0|C|F}}, between {{convert|5.0|C|F}} and {{convert|26.0|C|F}}, and above {{convert|26.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

There is a function to determine the representative clothing insulation at each segment. One can also take into account the posture of the occupants. So far, all the clothing insulation value can be used when the occupant is standing. When occupant is sitting, one has to realize the insulation effect of the chair, and the decrease of insulation due to compression of the air in the clothing.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

If the occupant is moving, it also affects the insulation value of clothing. In general, body motion decreases the clothing insulation by pumping air through clothing. ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' recognizes that this effect varies largely depending on the nature of the movements and the nature clothing, such as how tight the clothing is. Thus, it only provides an approximation of the clothing insulation value of a moving person. This approximation is an equation that relates the clothing insulation with the metabolic rate. And this equation is only valid when the metabolic rate is between 1.2 and 2.0.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' also states that the thermal environment conditions desired for sleeping and resting vary largely among individuals and cannot be determined using the methods provided in this standard. Considering that a sleeping person or one in reclining posture will be provided with sufficient insulation with the bedding material, and he or she is also free to adjust, it is impossible to determine the clothing insulation effect for these occupants unless they are immobile.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' cautious the users that there are two forms of variability among occupants. In the first form, different individuals wear different clothing due to factors that are not related to thermal conditions, and the second form is opposite. For the first, it is not correct to use the average clothing insulation value to determine the desired thermal conditions for all occupants.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== History of the standard ==
''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' was first published in 1966.  It was revised in 1974, 1981, 1992, 2004, 2010, 2013 and 2017.  Starting in 2004, it is now updated based on ASHRAE’s standard maintenance procedures. These periodic revisions are based on publicly reviewed addenda to the previous version available on ASHRAE’s website.&lt;ref name="55_2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2004 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992 the standard was updated with more extensive information on measurement protocols and an expanded definitions section.&lt;ref name="55_1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 1992 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2004 the standard underwent significant changes with the addition of two thermal comfort models: the [[Thermal comfort#PMV.2FPPD method|PMV/PPD]] model and the [[Thermal comfort#Adaptive comfort model|adaptive comfort model]].&lt;ref name="55_2004" /&gt;
 
In 2010 the standard included the following changes.  It re-introduced the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) as a method to calculate the cooling effect of air movement.  It also added a general satisfaction survey to section 7 intended to evaluate general thermal comfort in an occupied space, bringing the standard in line with current survey-based [[post-occupancy evaluation]] (POE) practices.&lt;ref name="55_2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2010 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013 the body of the standard was rewritten in mandatory language, with informative language moved from the body of the standard to informative appendices.  The applicability of the cooling effect of air movement was expanded to apply to naturally conditioned spaces.  Section 7 underwent major revisions for measuring thermal comfort in existing spaces including procedures for physical measurements and survey methods, and how to evaluate and report results.  The last major change concerns measuring air speed and air temperature experienced by the occupant, which now must be an average across three heights and over a period of time.&lt;ref name="55_2013"/&gt;

'''Agricultural wastewater treatment''' is a farm management agenda for controlling pollution from surface runoff that may be contaminated by chemicals in fertiliser, pesticides, animal slurry, crop residues or irrigation water.

==Nonpoint source pollution==
[[Nonpoint source pollution]] from farms is caused by [[surface runoff]] from fields during rain storms.  Agricultural runoff is a major source of [[water pollution|pollution]], in some cases the only source, in many [[drainage basin|watersheds]].&lt;ref name="EPA-fact"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/Ag_Runoff_Fact_Sheet.pdf "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] March 2005. Document No. EPA 841-F-05-001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sediment runoff===
[[Image:Eroded soils in Iowa.png|right|thumb|Highly erodible soils on a farm in [[Iowa]]]]
[[Soil]] washed off fields is the largest source of agricultural pollution in the United States. Excess sediment causes high levels of [[turbidity]] in water bodies, which can inhibit growth of [[aquatic plant]]s, clog [[fish]] [[gill]]s and smother animal [[larva]]e.&lt;ref name="EPA-fact" /&gt;

Farmers may utilize [[erosion control]]s to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include:

*[[crop rotation]]
*planting [[perennial]] crops
*installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;EPA. [http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/agriculture/agmm_index.cfm "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Agriculture."] July 2003. Document No. EPA-841-B-03-004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-95–4-96}}

===Nutrient runoff===
{{main|Nutrient pollution}}
[[Image:Epandeur de Fumier Rolland.JPG|right|thumb|Manure spreader]]
[[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are key pollutants found in runoff, and they are applied to farmland in several ways, such as in the form of commercial [[fertilizer]], animal [[manure]], or municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. These chemicals may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p. 2–9}}

Farmers can develop and implement [[nutrient management]] plans to mitigate impacts on water quality by:
*mapping and documenting fields, crop types, [[soil type]]s, water bodies
*developing realistic [[crop yield]] projections
*conducting [[soil test]]s and nutrient analyses of manures and/or sludges applied
*identifying other significant nutrient sources (e.g., irrigation water)
*evaluating significant field features such as highly erodible soils, subsurface drains, and shallow aquifers
*applying fertilizers, manures, and/or sludges based on realistic yield goals and using [[precision agriculture]] techniques.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-37–4-38}}&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/590.pdf "National Conservation Practice Standard: Nutrient Management."]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 590. August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticides===
[[Image:Crop Duster.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aerial application]] (crop dusting) of [[pesticide]]s over a [[soybean]] field in the U.S.]]
[[Pesticides]] are widely used by farmers to control plant [[pest (organism)|pests]] and enhance [[Agricultural productivity|production]], but chemical pesticides can also cause [[water quality]] problems.  Pesticides may appear in [[surface water]] due to:
*direct application (e.g. aerial spraying or [[broadcast spreader|broadcasting]] over water bodies)
*runoff during rain storms
*aerial drift (from adjacent fields).&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p.2–22}}
Some pesticides have also been detected in [[groundwater]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p.2–24}}

Farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/595.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management."]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 595. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/ipm.htm "Integrated Pest Management Principles."] March 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few safe ways of disposing of pesticide surpluses other than through containment in well managed landfills or by [[incineration]]. In some parts of the world, spraying on land is a permitted method of disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wetlands-preserve.org/phpUpload/uploads/RS%20Smithfield.pdf|title=Boss Hog|last=Tietz|first=Jeff|date=December 14, 2006|website=Wetlands Preserve|access-date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waste Pesticide Management|url=http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/pubs/factsheets/hw/WastePesticideManagementHowtoDispose.pdf|website=Oregon.Gov|publisher=State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Land Quality Division Hazardous Waste Program|accessdate=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202112958/http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/pubs/factsheets/hw/WastePesticideManagementHowtoDispose.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=April 2012}}

==Point source pollution==
Farms with large [[livestock]] and [[poultry]] operations, such as [[factory farm]]s, can be a major source of [[point source pollution|point source]] wastewater.  In the United States, these facilities are called [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s or ''confined animal feeding operations'' and are being subject to increasing government [[regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-17 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal wastes===
[[Image:Confined-animal-feeding-operation.jpg|right|thumb|Confined animal feeding operation in the [[United States]]]]
The constituents of animal wastewater typically contain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrec.org/pubs/dairy%20waste%20handbook.pdf Dairy Waste Anaerobic Digestion Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073309/http://www.mrec.org/pubs/dairy%20waste%20handbook.pdf |date=October 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatanksales.com/agriculturalwaste.html|title=Agricultural Waste|website=usatanksales.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Strong organic content — much stronger than human sewage
*High [[total suspended solids|solids]] concentration
*High [[nitrate]] and phosphorus content
*[[Antibiotics]]
*Synthetic [[hormones]]
*Often high concentrations of [[parasite]]s and their eggs
*Spores of ''[[Cryptosporidiosis|Cryptosporidium]]'' (a protozoan) resistant to drinking water treatment processes
*Spores of ''[[Giardia]]''
*Human pathogenic [[Bacterium|bacteria]] such as ''[[Brucellosis|Brucella]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''

Animal wastes from cattle can be produced as solid or semisolid manure or as a liquid [[slurry]]. The production of slurry is especially common in housed dairy cattle.

;Treatment
Whilst solid manure heaps outdoors can give rise to polluting wastewaters from runoff, this type of waste is usually relatively easy to treat by containment and/or covering of the heap.

Animal slurries require special handling and are usually treated by containment in lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. [[Constructed wetland]]s are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes, as are [[anaerobic lagoons]]. Excessive application or application to sodden land or insufficient land area can result in direct runoff to watercourses, with the potential for causing severe [[pollution]]. Application of slurries to land overlying [[aquifer]]s can result in direct contamination or, more commonly, elevation of nitrogen levels as [[nitrite]] or nitrate.

The disposal of any wastewater containing animal waste upstream of a drinking water intake can pose serious health problems to those drinking the water because of the highly resistant spores present in many animals that are capable of causing disabling disease in humans. This risk exists even for very low-level seepage via shallow surface drains or from rainfall run-off.

Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straws and [[Composting|composted]] at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.

===Piggery waste===
[[Image:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pig|Hog]] confinement barn or [[piggery]]]]

Piggery waste is comparable to other animal wastes and is processed as for general animal waste, except that many piggery wastes contain elevated levels of [[copper]] that can be toxic in the natural environment. The liquid fraction of the waste is frequently separated off and re-used in the piggery to avoid the prohibitively expensive costs of disposing of copper-rich liquid. [[Ascariasis|Ascarid]] worms and their eggs are also common in piggery waste and can infect humans if wastewater treatment is ineffective.

===Silage liquor===
Fresh or wilted [[grass]] or other green crops can be made into a semi-[[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] product called [[silage]] which can be stored and used as winter forage for cattle and sheep. The production of silage often involves the use of an acid conditioner such as [[sulfuric acid]] or [[formic acid]]. The process of silage making frequently produces a yellow-brown strongly smelling liquid which is very rich in simple [[sugars]], [[alcohol]], short-chain organic acids and silage conditioner. This liquor is one of the most polluting organic substances known. The volume of silage liquor produced is generally in proportion to the moisture content of the ensiled material.

;Treatment
Silage liquor is best treated through prevention by wilting crops well before silage making. Any silage liquor that is produced can be used as part of the food for pigs.
The most effective treatment is by containment in a slurry lagoon and by subsequent spreading on land following substantial dilution with slurry. Containment of silage liquor on its own can cause structural problems in concrete pits because of the acidic nature of silage liquor.

===Milking parlour (dairy farming) wastes===
Although milk is an important food product, its presence in wastewaters is highly polluting because of its organic strength, which can lead to very rapid [[Hypoxia (environmental)|de-oxygenation]] of receiving waters. [[Dairy farming#Milking parlors|Milking parlour]] wastes also contain large volumes of wash-down water, some animal waste together with cleaning and [[disinfection]] chemicals.

;Treatment
Milking parlour wastes are often treated in [[mixture|admixture]] with human sewage in a local [[sewage treatment]] plant. This ensures that disinfectants and cleaning agents are sufficiently diluted and amenable to treatment. Running milking wastewaters into a farm slurry lagoon is a possible option although this tends to consume lagoon capacity very quickly. Land spreading is also a treatment option. ''See also [[Industrial wastewater treatment]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater treatment|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/wastewater-treatment/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaughtering waste===
Wastewater from slaughtering activities is similar to milking parlour waste (see above) although considerably stronger in its organic composition and therefore potentially much more polluting.

;Treatment
As for milking parlour waste (see above).

===Vegetable washing water===
Washing of [[vegetable]]s produces large volumes of water contaminated by soil and vegetable pieces. Low levels of pesticides used to treat the vegetables may also be present together with moderate levels of disinfectants such as [[chlorine]].

;Treatment
Most vegetable washing waters are extensively recycled with the solids removed by settlement and filtration. The recovered soil can be returned to the land.

===Firewater===
Although few farms plan for fires, fires are nevertheless more common on farms than on many other industrial premises. Stores of  pesticides, herbicides, fuel oil for farm machinery and fertilizers can all help promote fire and can all be present in environmentally lethal quantities in [[Firewater (fire fighting)|firewater]] from [[firefighting|fire fighting]] at farms.

'''Treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;
All farm environmental management plans should allow for containment of substantial quantities of firewater and for its subsequent recovery and disposal by specialist disposal companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO600BBUD-e-e.pdf|title=Managing Fire water and major spillages - Environment Agency Guidance note PPG18 ( retrieved 19 April 2009)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219043323/http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO600BBUD-e-e.pdf|archivedate=19 December 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration and mixture of contaminants in firewater make them unsuited to any treatment method available on the farm. Even land spreading has produced severe taste and odour problems for downstream water supply companies in the past.

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Anaerobic digestion''' is a collection of processes by which [[microorganisms]] break down [[biodegradable]] material in the absence of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="nnfcc"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-fuels-and-energy-factsheet-anaerobic-digestion "NNFCC Renewable Fuels and Energy Factsheet: Anaerobic Digestion"], Retrieved on 2011-11-22&lt;/ref&gt; The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to [[Waste management|manage waste]] or to produce fuels. Much of the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as home fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion.

Anaerobic [[digestion]] occurs naturally in some soils and in lake and [[oceanic basin]] [[sediment]]s, where it is usually referred to as "anaerobic activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Koyama, Tadashiro|year=1963|title=Gaseous metabolism in lake sediments and paddy soils and the production of atmospheric methane and hydrogen|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=68|issue=13|pages=3971–3973|doi=10.1029/JZ068i013p03971|bibcode=1963JGR....68.3971K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Pamatmat, Mario Macalalag|author2=Bhagwat, Ashok M.|year=1973|title=Anaerobic metabolism in Lake Washington sediments|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=18|issue=4|pages=611&amp;ndash;627|url=http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_18/issue_4/0611.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216221344/http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_18/issue_4/0611.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2013|deadurl=yes|doi=10.4319/lo.1973.18.4.0611|df=dmy-all|bibcode=1973LimOc..18..611P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the source of [[Methane#Occurrence|marsh gas methane]] as discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zehnder, Alexander J.

The digestion process begins with [[bacteria]]l [[hydrolysis]] of the input materials. Insoluble [[organic polymer]]s, such as [[carbohydrate]]s, are broken down to soluble derivatives that become available for other bacteria. [[Acidogenesis|Acidogenic bacteria]] then convert the [[sugar]]s and [[amino acid]]s into carbon dioxide, [[hydrogen]], [[ammonia]], and [[organic acid]]s. These bacteria convert these resulting organic acids into [[acetic acid]], along with additional ammonia, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Finally, [[methanogen]]s convert these products to methane and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/content/download/472/3779/file/WB89-InfoSheet(Anaerobic%20Digestion).pdf Anaerobic digestion reference sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005194523/http://www.waste.nl/content/download/472/3779/file/WB89-InfoSheet(Anaerobic%20Digestion).pdf |date=5 October 2011 }}, waste.nl.

Anaerobic digestion is used as part of the process to treat biodegradable waste and [[sewage sludge]]. As part of an integrated [[waste management]] system, anaerobic digestion reduces the emission of [[landfill gas]] into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/biogas/agricultural-biogas/ Agricultural Biogas], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 08.11.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaerobic digestion is widely used as a source of [[renewable energy]]. The process produces a [[biogas]], consisting of [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]], and traces of other ‘contaminant’ gases.&lt;ref name="nnfcc" /&gt; This biogas can be used directly as fuel, in combined heat and power gas engines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/gas_engines.html GE Jenbacher Biogas Engines], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 15.04.11&lt;/ref&gt; or upgraded to natural gas-quality [[biomethane]]. The nutrient-rich [[digestate]] also produced can be used as [[fertilizer]].

With the re-use of waste as a resource and new technological approaches that have lowered [[capital costs]], anaerobic digestion has in recent years received increased attention among governments in a number of countries, among these the United Kingdom (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/anaerobic-digestion-strat-action-plan.pdf Anaerobic Digestion Strategy and Action Plan], defra.gov.uk.

==Process==
{{Main|Anaerobic respiration}}

Many microorganisms affect anaerobic digestion, including acetic acid-forming [[bacteria]] ([[acetogen]]s) and methane-forming [[archaea]] ([[methanogen]]s). These organisms promote a number of chemical processes in converting the biomass to [[biogas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy (Report), NNFCC 09-012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaseous oxygen is excluded from the reactions by physical containment. Anaerobes utilize electron acceptors from sources other than oxygen gas. These acceptors can be the organic material itself or may be supplied by inorganic [[oxide]]s from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, the 'intermediate' end products are primarily [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and organic acids, plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adapted from'' Beychok, M. (1967) [[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]], First edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an anaerobic system, the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.&lt;ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49" /&gt;

Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. Therefore, common practice is to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as "seeding" the digesters, typically accomplished with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80434e/80434E0k.htm The biogas plant], unu.edu. Retrieved 5.11.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process stages===
The four key stages of anaerobic digestion involve [[hydrolysis]], [[acidogenesis]], [[acetogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Anaerobic digestion" /&gt;
The overall process can be described by the chemical reaction, where organic material such as glucose is biochemically digested into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by the anaerobic microorganisms.
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid; max-width: 450px;"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* '''Hydrolysis'''
In most cases, biomass is made up of large organic polymers. For the bacteria in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material, these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts. These constituent parts, or monomers, such as sugars, are readily available to other bacteria. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of these high-molecular-weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Sleat, R. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Hydrolytic Bacteria ''in'' Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p15&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[hydrolysis]] the complex organic molecules are broken down into [[simple sugar]]s, amino acids, and [[fatty acid]]s.

Acetate and hydrogen produced in the first stages can be used directly by methanogens. Other molecules, such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) with a chain length greater than that of acetate must first be [[catabolised]] into compounds that can be directly used by methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, D. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Transitional bacteria in anaerobic digestion of biomass, p35&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Acidogenesis'''
The biological process of [[acidogenesis]] results in further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic (fermentative) bacteria. Here, VFAs are created, along with ammonia, carbon dioxide, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], as well as other byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sop.inria.fr/relation_ext/slides/water_treatment.pdf What is anaerobic digestion], sop.inria.fr. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way [[sour milk|milk sours]].

* '''Acetogenesis'''
The third stage of anaerobic digestion is [[acetogenesis]]. Here, simple molecules created through the acidogenesis phase are further digested by acetogens to produce largely acetic acid, as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotank.co.uk/anaerobic_digestion.htm Anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012031436/http://www.biotank.co.uk/anaerobic_digestion.htm |date=12 October 2007 }}, biotank.co.uk. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Methanogenesis'''
The terminal stage of anaerobic digestion is the biological process of [[methanogenesis]]. Here, methanogens use the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane, carbon dioxide, and water. These components make up the majority of the biogas emitted from the system. Methanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anaerobic Digester: How It Works [Process] {{!}} GreenTheFuture.com|url = http://greenthefuture.com/DIGESTER_HOWITWORKS_PROCESS.html|website = greenthefuture.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining, indigestible material the microbes cannot use and any dead bacterial remains constitute the digestate.

===Configuration===
Anaerobic digesters can be designed and engineered to operate using a number of different configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, [[Mesophilic digester|mesophilic]] vs. [[Thermophilic digester|thermophilic]] temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative Evaluation of Batch and Continuous Anaerobic Digesters in Biogas Production from Municipal Solid Waste using Mathematical Models|url = http://www.cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/view/1160|journal = Agricultural Engineering International: CIGR Journal|date = 2009-01-16|issn = 1682-1130|language = en|first = Igoni Hilkia|last = A|first2 = M.

====Batch or continuous====
Anaerobic digestion can be performed as a batch process or a continuous process. In a batch system, biomass is added to the reactor at the start of the process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs [[inoculation]] with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario, biogas production will be formed with a [[normal distribution]] pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a batch reactor is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with [[in-vessel composting]]. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed, the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for [[in-vessel composting]] before it is opened&lt;ref&gt;[http://aikantechnology.com/how-it-works/batch-processing.html aikantechnology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206123235/http://www.aikantechnology.com/how-it-works/batch-processing.html |date=6 February 2012 }} Retrieved 10. Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work, it is typically a cheaper form of digestion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/research/renewable/biomass/anaerobic_digestion/index.html Anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613112417/http://www.energy.ca.gov/research/renewable/biomass/anaerobic_digestion/index.html |date=13 June 2009 }}, energy.ca.gov. Retrieved 18.06.09.&lt;/ref&gt; Using more than one batch reactor at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas.

In continuous digestion processes, organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed) or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; first in – first out). Here, the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]s, [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]]s, [[expanded granular sludge bed]]s, and [[internal circulation reactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paques.nl/?pid=42&amp;parentid=41 BIOPAQ IC], paques.nl.

====Temperature====
The two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters determine the species of methanogens in the digesters:&lt;ref&gt;Song, Y.C., Kwon, S.J., Woo, J.H. (2004) Mesophilic and thermophilic temperature co-phase anaerobic digestion compared with single-stage mesophilic- and thermophilic digestion of sewage sludge, Water Res. 2004 Apr;38(7):1653–62&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mesophilic digester|''Mesophilic'' digestion]] takes place optimally around 30 to 38&amp;nbsp;°C, or at ambient temperatures between 20 and 45&amp;nbsp;°C, where mesophiles are the primary microorganism present.
* [[Thermophilic digester|''Thermophilic'' digestion]] takes place optimally around 49 to 57&amp;nbsp;°C, or at elevated temperatures up to 70&amp;nbsp;°C, where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present.

A limit case has been reached in [[Bolivia]], with anaerobic digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking more than three times the normal mesophilic time process.&lt;ref name="lrrd.org"/&gt; In experimental work at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], a 1,000 litre digester using [[psychrophiles]] harvested from "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" has produced 200–300&amp;nbsp;litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="NewSc2785p14"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast, while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the [[Animal By-Products Regulations]] in the European Union, requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of mesophilic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/animalbyproducts/index_en.htm Animal by-products introduction], ec.europa.eu. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional pre-treatment can be used to reduce the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as pasteurisation) to significantly enhance the biogas output. The pasteurisation process can also be used to reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic digester. Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with [[maceration (sewage)|maceration]] of the solids.

====Solids content====
In a typical scenario, three different operational parameters are associated with the solids content of the feedstock to the digesters:
* High solids (dry—stackable substrate)
* High solids (wet—pumpable substrate)
* Low solids (wet—pumpable substrate)

High solids (dry) digesters are designed to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters are designed to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed into the top of the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.&lt;ref name="eunomia.co.uk"&gt;[http://eunomia.co.uk/NI%20AD%20final%20report.pdf Feasibility study concerning anaerobic digestion in Northern Ireland], eunomia.co.uk, Retrieved 19.08.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://eunomia.co.uk/NI%20AD%20final%20report.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maximum"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jewell | first1 = W.| first2 = R.| first3 = B. | title = Methane fermentation of energy crops: Maximum conversion kinetics and in situ biogas purification | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 5| issue = 3–4 | pages = 261–278 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(93)90076-G| last2 = Cummings| last3 = Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High solids (wet) digesters process a thick slurry that requires more energy input to move and process the feedstock. The thickness of the material may also lead to associated problems with abrasion. High solids digesters will typically have a lower land requirement due to the lower volumes associated with the moisture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} High solids digesters also require correction of conventional performance calculations (e.g. gas production, retention time, kinetics, etc.) originally based on very dilute sewage digestion concepts, since larger fractions of the feedstock mass are potentially convertible to biogas.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| first2 = R.| first3 = T.| first4 = W. | title = Methods for kinetic analysis of methane fermentation in high solids biomass digesters| last1 = Richards | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 1| issue = 2 | pages =  65–73| year = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(91)90028-B| last2 = Cummings| last3 = White| last4 = Jewell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low solids (wet) digesters can transport material through the system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land than high solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding, and increases the rate of gas production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Complexity====
Digestion systems can be configured with different levels of complexity.&lt;ref name="eunomia.co.uk" /&gt; In a '''single-stage digestion system''' (one-stage), all of the biological reactions occur within a single, sealed reactor or holding tank. Using a single stage reduces construction costs, but results in less control of the reactions occurring within the system. Acidogenic bacteria, through the production of acids, reduce the pH of the tank. Methanogenic bacteria, as outlined earlier, operate in a strictly defined pH range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZdRJfMKORwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=acidogens+reduce+ph&amp;source=web&amp;ots=EJkTnAMkfq&amp;sig=qlyQVlqbt_N_1m1c20NduxAEK90#PPP1,M1 Biomethanation in advances in biochemical engineering and biotechnology], books.google.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biological reactions of the different species in a single-stage reactor can be in direct competition with each other. Another one-stage reaction system is an [[anaerobic lagoon]]. These lagoons are pond-like, earthen basins used for the treatment and long-term storage of manures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/explore/envqual/eq0387.htm Anaerobic Lagoons for Storage/Treatment of Livestock Manure], missouri.edu. Retrieved 8.11.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the anaerobic reactions are contained within the natural anaerobic sludge contained in the pool.

In a '''two-stage digestion system''' (multistage), different digestion vessels are optimised to bring maximum control over the bacterial communities living within the digesters. Acidogenic bacteria produce organic acids and more quickly grow and reproduce than methanogenic bacteria. Methanogenic bacteria require stable pH and temperature to optimise their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71002223/ABSTRACT Abstract: Methanogenic population dynamics during start-up of anaerobic digesters treating municipal solid waste and biosolids], interscience.wiley.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and acidogenesis occur within the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either mesophilic or thermophilic) prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to the rate at which feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.archive.mlodeuu.com/ahvla-en/animalh/disease-control/by-prods Animal By-Products Regulations], defra.gov.uk. Retrieved 24.10.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182207/http://www.defra.gov.archive.mlodeuu.com/ahvla-en/animalh/disease-control/by-prods |date=16 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, there may be a pasteurisation or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably, it is not possible to completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.

==== Residence time ====
The residence time in a digester varies with the amount and type of feed material, and with the configuration of the digestion system. In a typical two-stage mesophilic digestion, residence time varies between 15 and 40&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=4reportspubs%5C4_8focus%5Chimetfocus.xml HIMET—A Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion Process for Converting Waste to Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030224122741/http://gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=4reportspubs%5C4_8focus%5Chimetfocus.xml |date=24 February 2003 }}, gastechnology.org. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt; while for a single-stage thermophilic digestion, residence times is normally faster and takes around 14&amp;nbsp;days. The plug-flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event, digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the case of an [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB), hydraulic residence times can be as short as 1 hour to 1 day, and solid retention times can be up to 90 days. In this manner, a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic retention times with the use of a sludge blanket.&lt;ref&gt;Finstein, M. S. (2006) [http://www.oaktech-environmental.com/documents/ProceedingsSWANA2006Nashville.pdf ArrowBio process integrates preprocessing and advanced anaerobic digestion to recover recyclables and generate electricity], oaktech-environmental.com. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow excess material to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Inhibition===
The anaerobic digestion process can be inhibited by several compounds, affecting one or more of the bacterial groups responsible for the different organic matter degradation steps. The degree of the inhibition depends, among other factors, on the concentration of the inhibitor in the digester. Potential inhibitors are ammonia, sulfide, light metal ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al), heavy metals, some organics (chlorophenols, halogenated aliphatics, N-substituted aromatics, long chain fatty acids), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2007.01.057 | pmid=17399981 | volume=99 | issue=10 | title=Inhibition of anaerobic digestion process: A review | year=2008 | journal=Bioresource Technology | pages=4044–4064 | last1 = Chen | first1 = Ye | last2 = Cheng | first2 = Jay J. | last3 = Creamer | first3 = Kurt S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feedstocks==
[[File:Anaerobic Lagoon at Cal Poly.jpg|thumb|Anaerobic lagoon and generators at the Cal Poly Dairy, United States]]

The most important initial issue when considering the application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31, Alfagy.com, retrieved 16.08.09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110727/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31, |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if biogas production is the aim, the level of putrescibility is the key factor in its successful application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/anaerobic.pdf Anaerobic digestion feedstock classification] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034038/http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/anaerobic.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, wisbiorefine.org. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The more putrescible (digestible) the material, the higher the gas yields possible from the system.

Feedstocks can include biodegradable waste materials, such as waste paper, grass clippings, leftover food, sewage, and animal waste.&lt;ref name=nnfcc /&gt; [[Wood]]y wastes are the exception, because they are largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobes are unable to degrade [[lignin]]. Xylophalgeous anaerobes (lignin consumers) or using high temperature pretreatment, such as pyrolysis, can be used to break lignin down. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown [[energy crop]]s, such as [[silage]], for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe, these facilities are referred to as "biogas" plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural anaerobic digester that accepts two or more input materials for simultaneous digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmer, A. &amp; Oeschsner, H. [http://ltnet.lv-h.de/en/volltext/Lt20016/LT20016E_412_413.pdf Co-fermentation of grass and forage maize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://ltnet.lv-h.de/en/volltext/Lt20016/LT20016E_412_413.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}, Energy, Landtechnik, 5/11, p 56, ltnet.lv-h.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time required for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily digestible sugars breaks down quickly, whereas intact lignocellulosic material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to break down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anaerobic-digestion.com/old-rope-anaerobic-digestion-article], waste-management-world.com.

Anaerobic digesters were originally designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material with the most potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material has already had much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion of two or more types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as slaughterhouse waste, fats, oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Anaerobic Digestion Initiative Advisory Committee (ADIAC)|title=Feedstock|url=http://www.bcfarmbiogas.ca/Feedstockenergy/feedstock |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213185207/http://bcfarmbiogas.ca/Feedstockenergy/feedstock |archivedate=13 December 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moisture content===
A second consideration related to the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable it will be to handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?doi=XfhO-iP3em4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=high+solids+anaerobic+digestion+bulking&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fEDEUaGKK4&amp;sig=B9CbvsX37xfMDLF4ILVhMKp2D-U#PPP1,M1 Management of Urban Biodegradable Waste], books.google.com. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvsde.ops-oms.org/bvsaar/cdlodos/pdf/anaerobiccodigestion495.pdf Anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and rice straw], bvsde.ops-oms.org. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.&lt;ref name="Low" /&gt;

===Contamination===
The level of contamination of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seas.ucla.edu/stenstro/r/r10 Anaerobic digestion of classified municipal solid wastes], seas.ucla.edu. Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

After sorting or screening to remove any physical contaminants from the feedstock, the material is often shredded, minced, and mechanically or hydraulically pulped to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and, hence, increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids can be achieved by using a [[chopper pump]] to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight digester, where anaerobic treatment takes place.

===Substrate composition===
Substrate composition is a major factor in determining the methane yield and methane production rates from the digestion of biomass. Techniques to determine the compositional characteristics of the feedstock are available, while parameters such as solids, elemental, and organic analyses are important for digester design and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Jerger, D. &amp; Tsao, G. (2006) Feed composition in Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p65&lt;/ref&gt; Methane yield can be estimated from the elemental composition of substrate along with an estimate of its degradability (the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Biotechnology|last=Rittmann 1, McCarty 2|first=B 1, P 2|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2001|isbn=978-0072345537|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to predict biogas composition (the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide) it is necessary to estimate [[carbon dioxide]] [[Partition coefficient|partitioning]] between the aqueous and gas phases, which requires additional information (reactor temperature, [[pH]], and substrate composition) and a chemical speciation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=D.

Using anaerobic digestion technologies can help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in a number of key ways:
* Replacement of fossil fuels
* Reducing or eliminating the energy footprint of waste treatment plants
* Reducing methane emission from landfills
* Displacing industrially produced chemical fertilizers
* Reducing [[automobile|vehicle]] movements
* Reducing [[electricity grid|electrical grid]] transportation losses
* Reducing usage of [[LP Gas]] for [[cooking]]

If the putrescible waste processed in anaerobic digesters were disposed of in a landfill, it would break down naturally and often anaerobically. In this case, the gas will eventually escape into the atmosphere. As methane is about 20 times more potent as a [[greenhouse gas]] than carbon dioxide, this has significant negative environmental effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2005/02/01/global_warming_methane_could_be_far_worse_than_carbon_dioxide.htm Global warming methane could be far more potent than carbon dioxide] newmediaexplorer.org. Retrieved 17.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries that collect household waste, the use of local anaerobic digestion facilities can help to reduce the amount of waste that requires transportation to centralized landfill sites or incineration facilities. This reduced burden on transportation reduces carbon emissions from the collection vehicles. If localized anaerobic digestion facilities are embedded within an electrical distribution network, they can help reduce the electrical losses associated with transporting electricity over a national grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/04-05/demand_side_management/framework5.htm Renewable Energy Framework], esru.strath.ac.uk.

Methane and power produced in anaerobic digestion facilities can be used to replace energy derived from fossil fuels, and hence reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, because the carbon in biodegradable material is part of a [[carbon cycle]]. The carbon released into the atmosphere from the combustion of biogas has been removed by plants for them to grow in the recent past, usually within the last decade, but more typically within the last growing season. If the plants are regrown, taking the carbon out of the atmosphere once more, the system will be carbon neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afbini.gov.uk/index/services/specialist-advice/renewable-energy/re-anaerobic-digestion-intro/re-anaerobic-digestion-benefits.htm Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion], afbini.gov.uk.

Biogas from [[sewage sludge treatment]] is sometimes used to run a [[gas engine]] to produce electrical power, some or all of which can be used to run the sewage works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html 38% HHV Caterpillar Bio-gas Engine Fitted to Sewage Works | Claverton Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], claverton-energy.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80&amp;nbsp;MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150&amp;nbsp;MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000&amp;nbsp;MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000&amp;nbsp;MW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and strengthen the grid, while providing UK farmers with additional revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31 Alfagy.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110257/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=31 |date=7 July 2011 }}, "Be Green – Make Gas"&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oakland, California at the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]]’s main wastewater treatment plant (EBMUD), [[food waste]] is currently codigested with primary and secondary municipal wastewater solids and other high-strength wastes.

Anaerobic digestion of food waste pulp from the EBMUD food waste process provides a higher normalized energy benefit, compared to municipal wastewater solids: 730 to 1,300 kWh per dry ton of food waste applied compared to 560 to 940 kWh per dry ton of municipal wastewater solids applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=East Bay Municipal Utility District|title=Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste|year=2008|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/organics/ad/EBMUDFinalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organics: Anaerobic Digestion|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/organics/ad/index.html|work=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grid injection===
Biogas grid-injection is the injection of biogas into the [[natural gas grid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm Half Britain’s homes could be heated by renewable gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208061528/http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm |date=8 December 2009 }}, nationalgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; The raw biogas has to be previously upgraded to biomethane. This upgrading implies the removal of contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide or siloxanes, as well as the carbon dioxide. Several technologies are available for this purpose, the most widely implemented being [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure swing adsorption (PSA)]], water or [[Amine gas treating|amine scrubbing]] (absorption processes) and, in recent years, [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf Petersson A., Wellinger A.

===Vehicle fuel===
After upgrading with the above-mentioned technologies, the biogas (transformed into biomethane) can be used as vehicle fuel in adapted vehicles. This use is very extensive in Sweden, where over 38,600 gas vehicles exist, and 60% of the vehicle gas is biomethane generated in anaerobic digestion plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngvaeurope.eu/sweden Natural &amp; bioGas Vehicle Association (NVGA).

===Fertiliser and soil conditioner===
The solid, fibrous component of the digested material can be used as a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor can be used as a fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as [[Spain]], where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compostnetwork.info/index.php?id=44 Introduction and Spanish organic waste situation], compostnetwork.info. Retrieved 19.08.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking gas===
By using a [[bio-digester]], which produces the bacteria required for decomposing, cooking gas is generated. The organic garbage like fallen leaves, kitchen waste, food waste etc. are fed into a crusher unit, where the mixture is conflated with a small amount of water. The mixture is then fed into the bio-digester, where the bacteria decomposes it to produce cooking gas. This gas is piped to kitchen stove. A 2 cubic meter bio-digester can produce 2 cubic meter of cooking gas. This is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;kg of LPG. The notable advantage of using a bio-digester is the sludge which is a rich organic manure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article3698431.ece|title= Satisfaction of reducing your carbon footprint|journal= The Hindu| accessdate=2012-07-31|date= 2012-07-28|last1= Vijay|first1= Hema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digestate===
{{Main|digestate}}

Digestate is the solid remnants of the original input material to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. Digestate can come in three forms: fibrous, liquor, or a sludge-based combination of the two fractions. In two-stage systems, different forms of digestate come from different digestion tanks. In single-stage digestion systems, the two fractions will be combined and, if desired, separated by further processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/page/248 Fact sheet on anaerobic digestion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055626/http://www.waste.nl/page/248 |date=28 September 2007 }}, waste.nl.

The second byproduct (acidogenic digestate) is a stable, organic material consisting largely of lignin and cellulose, but also of a variety of mineral components in a matrix of dead bacterial cells; some plastic may be present. The material resembles domestic compost and can be used as such or to make low-grade building products, such as fibreboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Oaktech Consultation Response to UK Source Segregation Requirement], alexmarshall.me.uk.

Retrieved 24.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;
The solid digestate can also be used as feedstock for ethanol production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/bit.22627 | pmid=19998279 | title=A sustainable pathway of cellulosic ethanol production integrating anaerobic digestion with biorefining | year=2010 | journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume=105 | issue=6 | pages=1031–9 | last1 = Yue | first1 = Zhengbo | last2 = Teater | first2 = Charles | last3 = Liu | first3 = Yan | last4 = MacLellan | first4 = James | last5 = Liao | first5 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third byproduct is a liquid (methanogenic digestate) rich in nutrients, which can be used as a fertiliser, depending on the quality of the material being digested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwarming101.com/content/view/595/88888958/ Biomass and biogas], globalwarming101.com. Retrieved 24.10.07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605194618/http://www.globalwarming101.com/content/view/595/88888958/ |date=5 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) should be chemically assessed. This will depend upon the quality of the original feedstock. In the case of most clean and source-separated biodegradable waste streams, the levels of PTEs will be low. In the case of wastes originating from industry, the levels of PTEs may be higher and will need to be taken into consideration when determining a suitable end use for the material.

Digestate typically contains elements, such as lignin, that cannot be broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also, the digestate may contain ammonia that is phytotoxic, and may hamper the growth of plants if it is used as a soil-improving material. For these two reasons, a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms, such as fungi, helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation, the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates, improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil improver. Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ows.be/pub/Vitoria_InfoEnviro.mei07.pdf Vitoria Plant Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093059/http://www.ows.be/pub/Vitoria_InfoEnviro.mei07.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}, ows.be.

===Wastewater===
The final output from anaerobic digestion systems is water, which originates both from the moisture content of the original waste that was treated and water produced during the microbial reactions in the digestion systems. This water may be released from the dewatering of the digestate or may be implicitly separate from the digestate.

The wastewater exiting the anaerobic digestion facility will typically have elevated levels of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD). These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability to pollute. Some of this material is termed 'hard COD', meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses, it would negatively affect them by causing [[eutrophication]]. As such, further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through the water in a sequencing batch reactors or [[reverse osmosis]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dosta|first=Joan|last2=Galí |first2=Alexandre |last3=Macé |first3=Sandra |last4=Mata‐Álvarez |first4=Joan|title=Modelling a sequencing batch reactor to treat the supernatant from anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology &amp; Biotechnology|date=February 2007|volume=82|issue=2|pages=158–64|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jws/jctb/2007/00000082/00000002/art00006?crawler=true|accessdate=16 September 2013|doi=10.1002/jctb.1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/clarke_waste/water_treatment.htm Clarke Energy Reverse Osmosis Unit], clarke-energy.co.uk.

[[Feed-in tariffs in Germany]] were enacted in 1991, also known as FIT, providing long-term contracts compensating investments in renewable energy generation. Consequently, between 1991 and 1998 the number of anaerobic digester plants in Germany grew from 20 to 517. In the late 1990s, energy prices in Germany varied and investors became unsure of the market’s potential. The German government responded by amending FIT four times between 2000 and 2011, increasing tariffs and improving the profitability of anaerobic digestion, and resulting in reliable returns for biogas production and continued high adoption rates across the country.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Arbitrariness''' is the quality of being "determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arbitrariness|title=arbitrariness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as [[random]] decisions.  For example, during the [[1973 oil crisis]], Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even.  The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people.  Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their [[surname]] in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least in cases where surnames are irrelevant.

==Law== 
''Arbitrary'' comes from the Latin ''arbitrarius'', the source of ''arbiter''; someone who is tasked to judge some matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arbitrary Online Etymology Dictionary]: "'deciding by one's own discretion,' from L. arbitrarius, from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning gradually to mean ‘capricious’ (1646) and ‘despotic’ (1642).”&lt;/ref&gt;  An arbitrary legal judgment is a decision made at the discretion of the judge, not one that is fixed by  law.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Thomas.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p31MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=%22discretion+of+the+judge%22+and+arbitrary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tl9MMK-av4&amp;sig=Zd8y_5GB9g8c-GX0qg87BHllhqo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ShbJSZylDcrJtgeM-IyUAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA565,M1 The London Encyclopaedia]'', page 565 (1829): “Arbitrary, and the words more immediately connected with it, signify that the decision of the arbiter is made in consequence of his own uncontrolled will, or in consequence of reasons which do not appear.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, a prohibition of arbitrariness is enshrined into the [[constitution]].  Article 9 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] theoretically overrides even democratic decisions in prohibiting arbitrary government action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation]. The Federal Authorities
of the Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has overturned laws for having "[[Rational basis review|no rational basis]]."  A recent study of the U.S. asylum system suggests that arbitrariness in decision-making might be the cause of large disparities in outcomes between different adjudicators, a phenomenon described as [[refugee roulette]].

Article 330 of the Russian penal code defines 'Arbitrariness' as a specific crime, but with a very broad definition encompassing any 'actions contrary to the order presented by a law'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Arbitrary actions are closely related to [[teleology]], the study of purpose.  Actions lacking a ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'', a goal, are necessarily arbitrary.  With no end to measure against, there can be no standard applied to choices, so all decisions are alike.  Note that arbitrary or random methods in the standard sense of ''arbitrary'' may not qualify as arbitrary choices philosophically, if they were done in furtherance of a larger purpose; in the examples above, discipline in school and avoiding overcrowding at gas stations.

[[Nihilism]] is the philosophy that believes that there is no purpose in the universe, and that ''every'' choice is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Bernd (1971). "Nihilism, Reason, and "The Good"." ''The Review of Metaphysics.'' '''25''' (2):292&amp;ndash;310.&lt;/ref&gt; According to nihilism, the universe contains no value and is essentially meaningless. Because the universe and all of its constituents contain no higher goal for us to make subgoals from, all aspects of human life and experiences are completely arbitrary. There is no right or wrong decision, thought or practice, and whatever choice a human being makes is just as meaningless and empty as any other choice he or she could have made.

Many brands of [[theism]], the belief in a [[deity]] or deities, believe that everything has a purpose and that ''nothing'' is arbitrary.  In these philosophies, God created the universe for a reason, and every event flows from that.  Even seemingly random events cannot escape God's hand and purpose.  This is somewhat related to the [[argument from design]], the argument for God's existence because a purpose can be found in the universe.

Arbitrariness is also related to [[ethics]], the philosophy of decision-making.  Even if a person has a goal, they may choose to attempt to achieve it in ways that may be considered arbitrary.  [[Rationalism]] holds that knowledge comes about through intellectual calculation and deduction; many rationalists (though not all) apply this to ethics as well.  All decisions should be made through reason and logic, not via whim or how one "feels" what is right.  Randomness may occasionally be acceptable as part of a subtask in furtherance of a larger goal, but not in general.

In [[semiotics]], the general theory of signs, sign systems, and sign processes, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the notion of [[Course in General Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness]] according to which there is no necessary connection between the material sign (or ''signifier'') and the entity it refers to or denotes as its meaning (or ''signified'') as a mental concept or real object.

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, arbitrary normally means "any;" for instance, an arbitrary division of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] or an arbitrary [[permutation]] of a sequence.  Its use implies generality and that a statement does not only apply to special cases &amp;ndash; "you may select any choice possible, and this statement will still hold."  A simple example would be "Given an arbitrary integer, multiplying it by two will result in an [[Even and odd numbers|even number]]."

Even further, the implication is that generality will hold even if you have an opponent choose the item in question.  In some ways ''arbitrary'' is here synonymous with ''worst-case''.&lt;ref&gt;Tel, Gérard (2000). ''Introduction to distributed algorithms.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Berg in 1980.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Berg]], a leading researcher in the field of [[recombinant DNA technology]], who subsequently shared the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Frederick Sanger]], helped organize the conference.]]
The '''Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA''' was an influential [[academic conference|conference]] organized by [[Paul Berg]]&lt;ref&gt;“First recombinant DNA.” The Human Genome Project. http://www.genome.gov/25520302 accessed 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the potential [[biohazard]]s and regulation of [[biotechnology]], held in February 1975 at a conference center at [[Asilomar State Beach]].&lt;ref name="asilomar"&gt;[[Paul Berg]], [[David Baltimore]], [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Richard O. Roblin III]], and [[Maxine F. Singer]]. “Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules”. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' Vol. 72, No. 6, pp. 1981-1984, (June 1975): 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of about 140 professionals (primarily [[biologist]]s, but also including [[lawyer]]s and [[physician]]s) participated in the conference to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure the safety of [[recombinant DNA]] technology. The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the [[precautionary principle]].

The effects of these guidelines are still being felt through the biotechnology industry and the participation of the general public in scientific discourse.&lt;ref name="recombinant"&gt;Paul Berg and Maxine F. Singer. “The recombinant DNA controversy: Twenty years later”. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol 92, pp. 9011-9013, (Sept. 1995): 9011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to potential safety hazards, scientists worldwide had halted experiments using recombinant DNA technology, which entailed combining DNAs from different organisms.&lt;ref name="asilomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="recombinant" /&gt; After the establishment of the guidelines during the conference, scientists continued with their research, which increased fundamental knowledge about biology and the public's interest in [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Singer (1995), pp. 9011-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background: recombinant DNA technology==
[[Recombinant DNA]] technology arose as a result of advances in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of classical genetics became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA produced through the combined efforts of [[James D. Watson|James Watson]], [[Francis Crick]],and [[Rosalind Franklin]]. Further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical advances that were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wright. "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation, 1972-1982." ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'', 2nd Series, Vol. 2 (1986): 305&lt;/ref&gt; One of these capacities was recombinant DNA technology.

===Experimental design===
This technology entails the joining of DNA from different species and the subsequent insertion of the hybrid DNA into a host cell. One of the first individuals to develop recombinant DNA technology was a biochemist at Stanford by the name of Paul Berg.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berg and Maxine F. Singer. “The recombinant DNA controversy: Twenty years later”. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol 92, pp. 9011-9013, (Sept. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an antibacterial agent known as [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage lambda]]. In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the bacteriophage lambda. The final step involved placing the mutant genetic material into a laboratory strain of the E. coli bacterium. This last step, however, was not completed in the original experiment.&lt;ref name="Carmen, Ira H. 1985 pp. 61-62"&gt;Carmen, Ira H. ''Cloning and the Constitution: An Inquiry into Governmental Policymaking and Genetic Experimentation''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985) pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial bio-safety concerns===
Berg did not complete his final step due to the pleas of several fellow investigators who feared the biohazards associated with the last step. The SV40 was known to cause cancer tumors to develop in mice. Additionally, the E. coli bacterium (although not the strain used by Berg) inhabited the human intestinal tract. For these reasons, the other investigators feared that the final step would create cloned SV40 DNA that might escape into the environment and infect laboratory workers. These workers could then become cancer victims.&lt;ref name="Carmen, Ira H. 1985 pp. 61-62"/&gt;

Concern about this potential biohazard, along with others, caused a group of leading researchers to send a letter to the president of the National Academy of Science (NAS). In this letter, they requested that he appoint an ad hoc committee to study the bio-safety ramifications of this new technology. This committee, called the Committee on Recombinant DNA molecules of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., held in 1974, concluded that an international conference was necessary to resolve the issue and that until that time, scientists should halt experiments involving recombinant DNA technology.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen, Ira H. ''Cloning and the Constitution: An Inquiry into Governmental Policymaking and Genetic Experimentation''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asilomar Conference==

===Established principles===
The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA took place at the [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar Conference Center]] on California's Monterey Peninsula in 1975. The main goal of the conference was to address the biohazards presented by recombinant DNA technology. During the conference, the principles guiding the recommendations for how to conduct experiments using this technology safely were established. The first principle for dealing with potential risks was that containment should be made an essential consideration in the experimental design. A second principle was that the effectiveness of the containment should match the estimated risk as closely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Berg]], [[David Baltimore]], [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Richard O. Roblin III]], and [[Maxine F. Singer]]. “Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules”. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' Vol. 72, No. 6, pp. 1981-1984, (June 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference also suggested the use of biological barriers to limit the spread of recombinant DNA. Such biological barriers included fastidious bacterial hosts that were unable to survive in natural environments. Other barriers were nontransmissible and equally fastidious vectors (plasmids, bacteriophages, or other viruses) that were able to grow in only specified hosts.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"&gt;Berg et al. (1975), p. 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to biological barriers, the conference advocated the use of additional safety factors. One such safety factor was physical containment, exemplified by the use of hoods or where applicable, limited access or negative pressure laboratories. Another factor was the strict adherence to good microbiological practices, which would limit the escape of organisms from the experimental situation. Additionally, the education and training of all personnel involved in the experiments would be essential to effective containment measures.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"/&gt;

===Recommendations given===
The Asilomar Conference also gave recommendations for matching the types of containment necessary for different types of experiments. These recommendations were based on the different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels of containment. These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which the biohazards could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of containments, along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1982"/&gt;

===Recommendations applied to experiments===
For prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, experiments could be performed in minimal risk containment facilities when the construction of recombinant DNA molecules and their propagation involved prokaryotic agents that were known to exchange genetic information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Berg et al. (1975), pp. 1982-83&lt;/ref&gt; For experiments involving the creation and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules from DNAs of species that ordinarily did not exchange genetic information and generate novel biotypes, the experiments were to be performed in at least in a low risk containment facility. If the experiment increased the pathogenicity of the recipient species or result in new metabolic pathways in species, then moderate or high-risk containment facilities were to be used. In experiments where the range of resistance of established human pathogens to therapeutically useful antibiotics or disinfectants was extended, the experiments were to be undertaken only in moderate or high-risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"&gt;Berg et al. (1975), p. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with animal viruses, experiments that involved the linkage of viral genomes or genome segments to prokaryotic vectors and their propagation in prokaryotic cells were to be conducted only with vector-host systems that had demonstrated restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in moderate risk containment facilities. As safer vector-host systems became available, such experiments could be performed in low risk facilities. In experiments designed to introduce or propagate DNA from non-viral or other low risk agents in animal cells, only low risk animal DNA could be used as vectors and the manipulations were to be confined to moderate risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

With eukaryotes, attempts to clone segments of DNA using recombinant DNA technology from warm-blooded vertebrates genomes were to be performed only with vector-host systems that had demonstrably restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in a moderate risk containment facility. This was because they potentially contained cryptic viral genomes that were potentially pathogenic to humans. However, unless the organism made a dangerous product, recombinant DNAs from cold-blooded vertebrates and all other lower eukaryotes could be constructed and propagated with the safest vector-host system available in low risk containment facilities. Additionally, purified DNA from any source that performed known functions and was judged to be non-toxic could be cloned with available vectors in low risk containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

===Prohibited experiments===
In addition to regulating the experiments that were conducted, the guidelines also forbade the performance of other experiments. One such experiment was the cloning of recombinant DNAs derived from highly pathogenic organisms. In addition, neither the cloning of DNA containing toxin genes, nor large scale experiments using recombinant DNAs that were able to make products that were potentially harmful to humans, animals or plants were allowed under the guidelines. These experiments were banned because the potential biohazards could not be contained by the then current safety precautions.&lt;ref name="Berg et al. 1975, p. 1983"/&gt;

===Science and the general public===
The participants of the Asilomar Conference also endeavored to bring science into the domain of the general public, with a possible motivation being the [[Watergate scandal]]. The scandal resulted from a bungled break-in at the Watergate hotel, which served as the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972. Two years after the burglary, taped evidence was discovered that indicated that President Nixon had discussed a cover-up a week after it. Three days following the release of the tape, Nixon resigned from his presidential office. This event focused the nation's attention on the problem of government secrecy fostering illegal and immoral behavior and it has been suggested by the political scientist, Ira H. Carmen, that this motivated the scientists at the Asilomar Conference to bring science into the public eye to ensure that they would not be accused of a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Smoller. “Watergate Revisited.” ''PS: Political Science and Politics'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (June 1992): 225; and Carmen, ''Cloning and the Constitution'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to Dr. Berg and Dr. Singer, by being forthright, scientists avoided restrictive legislation due to the development of a consensus on how they were to conduct their research.&lt;ref name="Berg and Singer 1995, p. 9012"&gt;Berg and Singer (1995), p. 9012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing science into the public eye also coincided with the rapid rate at which recombinant DNA technology entered the industrial world. Because of the practical applications of the technology, funding for research using it started coming more from the private sector and less from the public sector. In addition, many molecular biologists who once confined themselves to academia, developed ties with private industry as equity owners, corporate executives and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation", p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of a biotechnology industry, although during this time, public debates occur over the hazards of recombinant DNA.&lt;ref name="Wright p. 360"&gt;Wright, "Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Social Transformation", p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; These debates were eventually won over by scientists who stated that the hazards were exaggerated and that the research could be conducted safely.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wright. “Molecular Biology or Molecular Politics? The Production of Scientific Consensus on the Hazards of Recombinant DNA Technology.” ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Nov. 1986). pp. 595-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was seen in the Ascot report, found in the Federal Register in March 1978. This report emphasized that the hazards of recombinant DNA to the general community were small to the point that they were of no practical consequence to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, “Molecular Biology or Molecular Politics?”, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, along with high economic pressures for industrial development and a more supportive political environment that existed after 1979, research and industry based on recombinant DNA continued to expand.&lt;ref name="Wright p. 360"/&gt;

==Significance of the conference==
Years after the conference, people ascribed a large amount of significance to it. According to Paul Berg and [[Maxine Singer]] in 1995, the conference marked the beginning of an exceptional era for both science and the public discussion of science policy. The guidelines devised by the conference enabled scientists to conduct experiments with recombinant DNA technology, which by 1995 dominated biological research. This research, in turn, increased knowledge about fundamental life processes, such as the cell cycle. Additionally, the conference along with public debates on recombinant DNA, increased public interest in biomedical research and molecular genetics. For this reason, by 1995, genetics and its vocabulary had become a part of the daily press and television news. This, in turn, stimulated knowledgeable public discussion about some of the social, political and environmental issues that emerged from genetic medicine and the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture. Another significant outcome of the conference was the precedent it set about how to respond to changes in scientific knowledge. According to the conference, the proper response to new scientific knowledge was to develop guidelines that governed how to regulate it.&lt;ref name="Berg and Singer 1995, p. 9012"/&gt;

{{Anthropology of art|Basic}}

'''Body culture studies''' describe and compare bodily practice in the larger context of [[culture]] and [[society]], i.e. in the tradition of [[anthropology]], [[history]] and [[sociology]]. As body culture studies analyse culture and society in terms of human bodily practices, they are sometimes viewed as a form of [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].
The significance of the body and of body culture (in German ''Körperkultur'', in Danish ''kropskultur'') was discovered since the early twentieth century by several historians and sociologists. During the 1980s, a particular school of body culture studies spread, in connection with – and critically related to – [[sport]]s studies. Body culture studies were especially established at Danish universities and academies and cooperated with Nordic, European and East Asian research networks.

Body culture studies include studies of [[dance]], play ([[play (activity)]]) and [[game]], outdoor activities, festivities and other forms of movement culture. The field of body culture studies is floating towards studies of medical cultures, of working habits, of [[gender]] and sexual cultures, of [[fashion]] and [[body decoration]], of popular [[festivity]] and more generally towards [[popular culture]] studies.

Body culture studies have shown useful by making the study of sport enter into broader historical and sociological discussion – from the level of subjectivity to civil society, state and market.

== Earlier studies in body and culture ==

Since early 20th century, sociologists and philosophers had discovered the significance of the body, especially [[Norbert Elias]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and some phenomenologists. Later, [[Michel Foucault]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and the Stuttgart [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] delivered important inspirations for the new body culture studies.

The sociologist Norbert Elias (1939) wrote the first sociology, which placed the body and bodily practice in its centre, describing the change of table manners, shame and violence from the Middle Ages to Early Modern court society as a process of civilisation. Later, Elias (1989) studied the culture of duel in Wilhelminian Prussia, throwing light on particular traits of the German [[sonderweg]]. Elias' figurational sociology of the body became productive especially in the field of sport studies (Elias/ Dunning 1986; [[Eric Dunning]] et al. 2004). His concept of the "process of civilisation" received, however, also critique from the side of comparative [[anthropology]] of bodily practices (Duerr 1988/2005).

The [[Frankfurt School]] of [[Critical Theory]] turned towards the body with [[Marxist]] and [[Freudian]] perspectives. [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (1947) described the Western "[[dialectics]] of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]" as including an underground history of the body. Body history lead from the living body to the dead body becoming a commodity under [[capitalism]]. A younger generation of the Frankfurt School launched the [[Neo-Marxist]] sports critique (Rigauer 1969) and developed alternative approaches to movement studies and movement culture (Lippe 1974; Moegling 1988). Historical studies about the body in industrial work (Rabinbach 1992), in transportation (Schivelbusch 1977), and in [[Fascist]] aesthetics ([[Theweleit]] 1977) as well as in the philosophy of [[space]] ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998/ 2004) had their roots in this critical approach.

Philosophical phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) paid attention to the body, too. [[Helmuth Plessner]] (1941) studied laughter and weeping as fundamental human expressions. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1945) placed the body in the centre of human existence, as a way of experiencing the world, challenging the traditional body-mind dualism of [[René Descartes]]. [[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) approached bodily existence via a phenomenology of the elements and of space, starting by "[[psychoanalysis]] of fire".

Based on phenomenological traditions, [[Michel Foucault]] (1975) studied the configurations of knowledge in the post-1800 society, launching the concept of modern panoptical control (→[[Panopticon]]). The body appeared as object of military discipline and of the panopticon as a mechanism of "the biopolitics of power". Foucault's approach became especially influential for studies in sport, space, and architecture (Vertinsky/ Bale 2004) as well as for studies in the discipline of [[gymnastic]] and sport ([[Vigarello]] 1978; Barreau/ Morne 1984; Vertinsky/ McKay 2004).

While Foucault's studies focused on top-down strategies of power, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] directed his attention more towards bottom-up processes of social-bodily practice. For analysing the class aspect of the body, Bourdieu (1966/67) developed the influential concept of habitus as an incorporated pattern becoming social practice by diverse forms of taste, distinction and display of the body. Some of Bourdieu's disciples applied these concepts to the study of sports and gymnastics (Defrance 1987).

In Germany, influences of phenomenology induced body culture studies in the historical field. The Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] focused from 1971 on [[gestures]] and laughter, [[martial arts]], sport and dance to analyze changes of society and differences between European and non-European cultures (Nitschke 1975, 1981, 1987, 1989, 2009; [[Henning Eichberg]] 1978).

These approaches met with tendencies of the late 1970s and 1980s, when [[humanities]] and [[sociology]] developed a new and broader interest in the body. Sociologists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists, scholars from sport studies and from medical studies met in talking about "the return of the body" or its "reappearance" (Kamper/ Wulf 1982). The new interest towards the body was soon followed up by the term "body culture" itself.

== The word and concept of "body culture" – alternative practice ==

The word "body culture" appeared for first time around 1900, but at that time signifying a certain form of physical practice. The so-called "life reform" (German ''[[Lebensreform]]'') aimed at the reform of clothing and of nurture and favoured new bodily activities, which constituted a new sector side by side with established gymnastics and sport. The main fields of this third sector of movement culture were [[nudism]], rhythmic-expressive gymnastics, [[yoga]] and [[body building]] (Wedemeyer-Kolwe 2004) as well as a new type of youth wandering. Though highly diverse, they found a comprehensive term in the German word ''Körperkultur'', in English [[physical culture]] (→[[physical education]]), in French ''culture physique'', and in Danish ''kropskultur''. Inspirations from the movement of body culture gave birth to early studies in the history of bodily positions and movements (Gaulhofer 1930; [[Marcel Mauss]] 1934).

In German Socialist workers' sport, the concept of ''Körperkultur'' had a prominent place. The concept also entered into Russian [[Socialism]] where ''fiskultura'' became an alternative to [[bourgeois]] sport, uniting the revolutionary fractions of more aesthetical ''[[Proletkult]]'' and more health-oriented "hygienism" (Riordan 1977). Later, [[Stalinism]] forced the contradictory terms under the formula "sport and body culture". This continued in the [[Soviet bloc]] after 1945.
When the 1968 [[student movement]] revived Marxism, the concept of body culture – ''Körperkultur'' in West Germany, "somatic culture" in America – re-entered into the sports-critical discourse, but received new analytical dimensions. ''Quel corps?'' (Which body?) was the title of a critical review of sports, edited by the French Marxist [[educationalist]] [[Jean-Marie Brohm]] in 1975-1997. In Germany, a series of books under the title ''Sport: Kultur, Veränderung'' (Sport: culture, change) marked the body cultural turn from 1981, with works of Rigauer, Elias, Eichberg and others.

== Body culture studies – a new critical school ==

In Denmark, a particular school of Body Culture Studies – ''kropskultur'' – developed since around 1980 in connection with the critique of sport (Korsgaard 1982; Eichberg 1998; Vestergård 2003; Nielsen 1993 and 2005). It had its background in Danish popular gymnastics and in alternative movement practices – outdoor activities, play and game, dance, [[meditation]]. In Finland, the concept ''ruumiinkulttuuri'' found a similar attention (Sironen 1995; Sparkes/ Silvennoinen 1999).

In international cooperation, "body anthropology" became the keyword for French, Danish and German philosophers, sociologists and educationalists who founded the ''Institut International d'Anthropologie Corporelle (IIAC)'' in 1987. They undertook case studies in traditional [[game]]s as well as in "scenes" of new urban body cultures (Barreau/ Morne 1984; Barreau/ Jaouen 1998; Dietrich 2001 and 2002).

Body culture studies found a particular interest in East Asian countries. In Japan, the sociologist Satoshi Shimizu from the University of Tsukuba established in 2002 a ''Centre for the Study of Body Culture'', publishing the review ''Gendai Sports Hyôron'' (Contemporary Sport Critique, in Japanese, since 1999). In Taiwan, Hsu I-hsiung from the National Taiwan Normal University founded in 2003 the ''Taiwan Body Culture Society'' (Taiwan shenti wenhua xiehui), publishing the reviews ''Sport Studies'' (in Chinese, since 2007) and ''Body Culture Journal'' (in Chinese, since 2005). And in Korea, Jong Young Lee from the University of Suwon published since 2004 the ''International Journal of Eastern Sport &amp; Physical Education'', focusing on body culture and traditional games.

These initiatives were connected with each other both by contents and by personal networks. In the English and American world, Allen Guttmann (1978, 1996, 2004), [[John Hoberman]] (1984), John Bale (1996, 2002, 2004), Susan Brownell (1995, 2008) and Patricia Vertinsky (2004) contributed by opening the history, sociology and geography of sports towards body culture studies.

While the concept of body culture earlier had denoted an alternative practice and was used in singular, it became now an analytical category describing body cultures in plural. The terms of physical culture (or [[physical education]]) and body culture separated – the first describing a practice, the second a subject of theoretical analysis.

== Questioning the "individual" body ==

Studies in body culture have shown that bodily existence is more than just "the body" as being an individual skin bag under control of an individual mind. Bodily practice happens between the different bodies. This questions current types of thinking "the [[individual]]": the [[epistemological]] [[individualism]] and the thesis of '[[Modern history#Late modern period|late-modern]] [[individualism|individualization]]'.

The methodological habit of counter-posing "the individual" and "the society" is largely disseminated in sociology. It was fundamentally criticized by [[Norbert Elias]] who underlined that there was no meaning in the separation between the individual as a sort of core of human existence and the society as a secondary environment around this core. Society was inside the human body. In contrast, the epistemological [[solipsism]] treated human existence as if the human being was alone in the world – and was only in a secondary process "socialized" ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998 vol. 1).

Another current assumption is the historical-sociological individualism. Sociologists as [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] have postulated that individualization during "high" or "late modernity" had replaced all earlier traditions – religion, nation, class – and left "the individual" alone with its body. The body, thus, got a central position as the only fix-point of "[[self-identity]]" left after the dissolution of the traditional norms. The individual chooses and makes its own body as a sort of "[[gesamtkunstwerk]] [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]".

Body-cultural studies have challenged this assumption ([[Henning Eichberg]] 2010: 58-79). They throw light on inter-bodily relations, within which the human individuality has a much more complex position.

== Social time ==

An important aspect of body culture is temporal. Modern society is characterized by the significance of speed and acceleration. Sport, giving priority to competitive running and racing, is central among the phenomena illustrating the specifically modern velocity (Eichberg 1978, Bale 2004). The historical change from the circulating stroll in aristocratic and early bourgeois culture to modern [[jogging]] as well as the changes from coach traffic via the railway (Schivelbusch 1977) to the sport race of automobiles (→[[auto racing]]) (Sachs 1984) produced new body-cultural configurations of social time.

On the basis of [[transportation]] and [[urbanism]], [[blitzkrieg]] and sports, the French architect and cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] (1977) launched the terms of "dromology" (i.e. science of racing) and "dromocracy" (power or dominance of velocity) to describe the knowledge and the politics of modern social acceleration. But the concept of social time embraces many more differentiations, which can be explored by comparing time-dynamic movements of different ethnic cultures (Hall 1984).

== Social space ==

Another important aspect of body culture is spatial. Bodily display and movement always create space – physical space as socio-psychical space and vice versa. Bodily activities have during history changed between indoor or outdoor milieus, between non-specialized environment, specialized facilities (→[[sports facilities]]) and bodily opposition against existing standardized facilities or what was called "sport scape". In movement, straight lines and the culture of the streamline were confronted by [[mazes]] and [[labyrinthine]] structures, by patterns of [[fractal]] geometry. All these patterns are not just spatial-practical arrangements, but they play together with societal orientations. Under this aspect, one has described the history of panoptical control (Foucault 1975; Vertinsky/ Bale 2004), the parcellation of the sportive space, and the hygienic purification of spaces (Augestad 2003). [[Proxemics]] (Hall 1966), the study of distance and space, has become a special field of body culture studies.

Body culture studies have also influenced the understanding of "nature". In the period around 1800, the "nature" of body culture – of outdoor life, [[naturism]] and green movements (→[[green politics]]) – became a world of liberation and opposition: "Back to nature!" In the course of modern industrial culture, this "other" nature became subjected to colonization and simulation, forming a "second nature". It even became a virtual world, which is simulating people's senses as a "third nature". The study of body culture contributed to a history of [[cultural ecology]] (Eichberg 1988).

Body cultural studies also contributed to a differentiation between what in everyday language often is confused as 'space' and 'place' whose dialectics were shown by the Chinese-American philosopher [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] (see Bale 2004). Space can be described by coordinates and by certain [[choreographies]]. Spatial structures can be standardized and transferred from place to place, which is the case with the standardized facilities of sports. Place, in contrast, is unique – it is only here or there. Locality is related to identity. People play in a certain place – and create the place by play and game. The place plays with the people, as a co-player.

== Body culture and politics ==
Body culture can also be considered political such as how the [[body shape]] and appearance as well as sports, dance, and other recreational activities manifest and influence social change driven by politics. This is best demonstrated by [[practice theory]], which explains that, since body techniques serve as the means by which existing social order is produced and maintained, it, therefore, become important sites for challenging and transforming the social order when change does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Training the Body for China: Sports in the Moral Order of the People's Republic|last=Brownell|first=Susan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0226076466|location=Chicago|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In power plays, for instance, the body is used in sporting events as a form of rhetoric, articulating political causes. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the body became an important part of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[geopolitics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Politics of Post-9/11 American Sport: Power, Pedagogy and the Popular|last=Silk|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415873413|location=New York|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the projection of American power. On the other hand, the body was also used to condemn elitist and spectator sport within a mass physical culture starting this period in America, which evokes participation, inclusion, and populism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body is an integral component in the [[Feminist political theory|feminist politics]]. It is maintained that in order for this feminist initiatives to be effective, it is imperative that women's bodies, along with their works, labor, and voice, are present for everyone to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Suleiman|first=Susan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=0674298713|location=Cambridge|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilisation, discipline, modernity ==

Studies of body culture enriched the analysis of historical change by conflicting terms. [[Norbert Elias]] (1986) studied sport in order to throw light on the ''civilizing process'' (→[[The Civilizing Process]]). In sports, he saw a line going from original violence to civilized interlacement and pacification. Though there were undertones of hope, Elias tried to avoid [[evolutionism]], which since the nineteenth century postulated a 'progressive' way from 'primitive' to 'civilized' patterns.

While the concept of civilization normally had hopeful undertones, ''[[discipline]]'' had more critical undertones. Cultures of bodily discipline became visible – following [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and the [[Frankfurt School]] – in [[Baroque dance]] (Lippe 1974), in aristocratic and bourgeois pedagogy of the spinal column during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Vigarello 1978), and in [[hygienic]] strategies, school sanitation and school gymnastics during the twentieth century (Augestad 2003). Military exercise (→[[military drill]]) in Early Modern times was the classic field for body cultural discipline (Gaulhofer 1930; Kleinschmidt 1989).

In the field of sports, a central point of body-cultural dispute has been the question whether sport had its roots in Ancient Greek competitions of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] type or whether it was fundamentally linked to modernity. While nineteenth century's Neo-Humanism, Classicism and [[Olympism]] assumed the ancient roots of sport, body cultural studies showed that the patterns central to modern sports – quantification, rationalisation, principle of achievement – could not be dated before the industrial culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). What was practiced before, were popular games, noble exercises, festivities of different character, children's games and competitions, but not sport in modern understanding. The emergence of modern sport was an eruptive innovation rather than a logical prolongation of earlier practices. As a revolution of body culture, this transformation contributed to a deeper understanding of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The so-called Eichberg-Mandell-Guttmann theory about the uniqueness of modern sport became, however, a matter of controversies and was opposed by other historians (Carter/Krüger 1990).

What came out of the controversies between the concepts of modernity, evolution, civilization, discipline and revolution was that "[[modernization]]" only can be thought as a non-lineal change with nuances and full of contradictions. This is how the history of sport (Nielsen 1993 and 2005) and of gymnastics (Defrance 1987; Vestergård Madsen 2003) as well as the history of [[running]] (Bale 2004) have been described in body-cultural terms.

One of the visible and at the same time deeper changes in relation to the modern body concerns the dress reform and the appearance of the naked body, especially in the years between 1900 and the 1920s. The change from noble pale skin to suntanned skin as a 'sportive' distinction was not only linked to sport, but had a strong impact on society as a whole. The change of appreciated body colour reversed the social-bodily distinctions between people and classes fundamentally, and nudism became a radical expression of this body-cultural change.

== Industrial body and production ==

Body culture studies have cast new light on the origins and conditions of the Industrial Revolution, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed people's everyday life in a fundamental way. The traditional common-sense explanations of [[industrialization]] by technology and economy as 'driving forces' have shown as insufficient. Economic interests and technological change had their basic conditions in human social-bodily practice. The history of sport and games in body cultural perspective showed that this practice was changing one or two generations, before the Industrial Revolution as a technological and economic transformation took place. What had been [[carnival]]-like festivities, [[tournaments]] and popular games before, became modern sport by a new focus on results, measuring and quantifying records (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). Under the aspect of the principle of achievement, there was no sport in ancient Egypt, in ancient Greece, among the [[Aztecs]] or [[Vikings]], and in European [[Middle Ages]], though there were games, competitions and festivities. Sport as a new type of body culture resulted from societal changes in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries.

The genesis of sport in connection with industrial [[productivity]] called to attention the historical-cultural relativity of "production" (→[[Manufacturing]]) itself. Studies in the history of "the human motor" and the "mortal engines" of sport showed reification (→[[reification (Marxism)]]) and technology as lines of historical dynamics (Rigauer 1969; Vigarello 1988; Rabinbach 1992; Hoberman 1992). Production became apparent not as a universal concept, but as something historically specific – and sport was its body-cultural ritual.

== Trialectics of body culture ==

Body culture as a field of contradictions demands a dialectical approach, but it is not dualistic in character. Body culture studies have revealed trialectical relations inside the world of sports (Eichberg 1998, 2010; Bale 1996, 2002 and 2004).

The hegemonic model of Western modern body culture is ''achievement sport'', translating movement into records. Sportive competition follows the logic of productivity by bodily strain and forms a ranking pyramid with elite sports placed at the top and the losers at the bottom. Through sportive movement, people display a theatre of production.

A contrasting model within modern body culture is delivered by ''mass sports''. In [[gymnastics]] and [[fitness training]], the body is disciplined by subjecting it to certain rules of "scientific", social geometrical or aesthetic order (Roubal 2007). By rhythmic repetition and formal homogenization, the individual bodies are integrated into a larger whole, which is recommended in terms of reproduction (→[[reproduction (economics)]]), as being healthy and educative. Through fitness sport, people absolve a ritual of reproductive correctness and integration.

A third model is present in ''popular festivity'', ''dance and play''. In carnival and folk sport, people meet people by festive movement. This type of gathering may give life to the top-down arrangements of both productive achievement sport and reproductive fitness sport, too. But the body experience of popular festivity, dance, play and game is a-productive in itself – it celebrates relation in movement.

Practices of sport in their diversity and their historical change, thus, clarify inner contradictions inside social life more generally – among these the contradictions between state, market and civil society. The trialectics of body culture throw light on the complexity of societal relations.

== Body cultures in plural ==

"Culture" in singular is an abstraction. The study of body culture is always a study of body cultures in plural. Body cultures show human life in variety and differences, assimilation and distinction, conflicts and contradictions. This demands a comparative approach to otherness, and this is the way several studies in body culture have gone.

Culture was studied as cultures already by the school of [[Cultural Relativism]] in American anthropology ([[American Anthropological Association]]) in the 1930s ([[Ruth Benedict]]). [[Postcolonial]] studies have taken this [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] perspective up again (Bale 1996 and 2004; Brownell 1995; Azoy 2003; Leseth 2004). The discourse in singular about "the body in our society" became problematic when confronted with body cultures in conflict and tension.

The plurality and diversity of body cultures is, however, not only a matter of outward relations. There are also body cultures in plural inside a given society. The study of different class habitus (→[[class culture]]), [[youth cultures]], gender cultures (→[[gender identity]]) etc. opened up for deeper insights into the differentiation of civil society.

== Configurational analysis ==

Body culture studies try to understand bodily practice as patterns revealing the inner tensions and contradictions of a given society. In order to analyze these connections, the study of body culture has turned attention to the configurations of movement in time and space, the energy of movement, its interpersonal relations and objectification (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]). Above this basis, people build a superstructure of institutions and ideas, organising and reflecting body culture in relation to collective actions and interests (Eichberg 1978; Dietrich 2001: 10-32; see keyword 2).

By elaborating the complex interplay between bodily practice and the superstructures of ideas and conscience, body cultures studies challenge the established history and sociology.

'''Bommersvik''' is a '''Union college''' ({{lang-sv|italic=yes|Förbundskola}} from Förbund meaning ''union'' or ''association'' and skola meaning ''school'' or ''college'') built by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Youth League]] (SSU) and is situated outside the municipality of [[Södertälje]] in Sweden. Parts of the college grounds encompass a [[conference centre]] and recreational facilities that are extensively used by social democratic organizations both in Sweden and abroad. An art gallery can also be found on the grounds.

==Mission==
[[Image:Per Albin Hansson föreläser Bommersvik.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Per Albin Hansson]] (Prime Minister of Sweden from 1932 to 1946) delivering an outdoor lecture on Bommersvik grounds. Summer 1940]]
The college was formed because the SSU and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] planned to educate and train the next generation of trade union and [[Politician|political leaders]] by establishing an institution of higher learning with the mission to instruct these young social democrats on political matters such as trade union agreements and laws. Today it offers many popular courses each year on political science subjects. The curriculum is different from a regular [[political science]] academy in that the content of the courses is primarily focused on issues concerning the politics of the [[labour movement]].

The backgrounds of the professors teaching at the college vary and, depending on the course, lecturers can be recruited from the party and from the unions and labour movement. It is not uncommon for prime ministers or cabinet ministers to lecture on subjects of political interest. The Swedish Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]] lectured at Bommersvik as early as summer 1940.

Many foreign lecturers also visit the college from time to time, starting with the early example of [[Willy Brandt]] who lectured on 1 December 1940 about the problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi]] Germany and the occupied countries at the start of [[World War II]].

In 2010, the college began cooperating with [[Uppsala University]] so that students from the University can now attend [[rhetoric]] classes at Bommersvik.

==History==
[[Image:Bommersvik flaggor.JPG|thumb|right|200px|left|Colonel Lundeberg extracted a promise from the SSU that the [[Swedish flag]] would always be raised higher than the SSU [[Banner#Trade union banners|banner]]. This promise has been kept by the SSU ever since.]]
In 1934, ideas about creating a college for the Youth League began to form after Ivan Ohlson, one of the great leaders of the Swedish Labor movement, became inspired following a study trip to the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] and in 1936 work commenced to find an appropriate building. This was familiar territory for the SSU since the association already had gone through a similar process with another school, the Brunnsviks adult education college in Ludvika. Ivan Ohlson went on a late summer day to Bommersvik, with its beautiful natural surroundings, was sufficiently impressed with the place and recommended it as the future location for the school. His recommendation was officially adopted and in 1937 the decision was formalised. Ivan Ohlson is considered to be the founder of Bommersvik and one of the school's halls is named in his honour.

It was decided, after a search, that the school would be built on the grounds of a local farm. This property was owned by [[Colonel]] Lundeberg.

Only through a fundraising drive among the members and other organisations within the [[Labor Movement]], including the social democratic women's association, the party and trade unions etc. could the Socialist Party and the SSU find sufficient funds to buy Colonel Lundeberg's farm. The colonel, however, thought that selling the farm directly to the SSU was a sensitive matter, (since he was a military man with no association with the socialists), so, officially, Ivan Ohlson bought the farm instead, for 127,000 sek and a down payment of 20 000 which was a lot of money at that time. Colonel Lundeberg also extracted a promise from the SSU that the [[Swedish flag]] would always be raised higher than the SSU [[Banner#Trade union banners|banner]]. This promise has been kept by the SSU ever since.

The opening ceremony was held on 14 September 1937 with about 800 SSU members and party officials on the grounds. There was also high pressure on the officials involved because, among other things, of the press coverage of the event and of the political pressure by the social democrats. Algot Andersson became the first manager of the college.

Another important event took place when [[Tage Erlander]] withdrew in 1969 as party leader and Prime Minister, and his successor in both positions, [[Olof Palme]], ordered an honorary residence be built for him on the grounds of Bommersvik, in recognition of Erlander's valuable and lengthy service as Prime Minister of Sweden. The house is called even to this day "Erlandervillan" meaning ''Erlander's villa''. There, he and his wife Aina lived until his death in 1985.

==Culture and art==
[[Image:The Utøya-monument at Bommersvik (14658741627).jpg|thumb|Monument on Bommersvik of Victims of Utoya massacre in 2011.]]
[[Image:Olof Palme statsminister, tidigt 70-tal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Olof Palme]] (pictured) donated the majority of the vases from the Ming Dynasty]]
Social democratic Prime Ministers have brought, from time to time, [[work of art|objets d'art]] and other curios on their travels to the college in order to enhance its culture and [[fine art|art]] collections. For example, [[Olof Palme]] has donated to the school the majority of the vases from the [[Ming Dynasty]], the stuffed remains of a tiger and a gold statue of an [[Inca]] god. Various countries have also donated items for the school's collection. Perhaps the most controversial present was from [[North Vietnam]], namely the part of an American airplane shot down during the [[Vietnam war]]. This piece exists as a display case exhibit at the school.

In the college, students learn about [[criticism]] of society and there also exist pictures of famous artists that created fine portraits of well-known social democrats. There is a large library with books about policy and from authors that describe the workers' lives in Sweden, the so-called ''proletärförfattare,'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]:'' proletär'' meaning ''[[proletarian]]'' and ''författare'' meaning ''author,'' i.e. authors for the [[proletariat]]), such as [[Eyvind Johnson]] and [[Harry Martinson]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1974.

===Significant art exhibits===
* One of the most well-known sculptures in Bommersvik is Arne Jones's "Katedralen" (''Cathedral''), also featured on Bommervik's logo.&lt;ref name="Katedralen picture"&gt;[http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=60 Katedralen picture from the Bommersvik website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622062241/http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=60 |date=22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Torchlight processions", depicting the infamous [[Triumph of the Will|Nazi torchlight marches]], by artist Eric Johnsson. SSU received this as a present in 1937 as an indication of gratitude. Eric had among other things been forced to escape from [[Nazi Germany]]. SSU had criticized the [[Nazis]] in Germany long before the parent party did so in public.
[[Image:Bommersvik.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Bommersvik's main building: the Manor]]
* Tage Erlander and his legacy have always been important to the school and there are many portraits of him by artists such as Bo Beskow, Stig Claesson and Willem de Geer.
* The large oil painting "Proletarian fighting will" (Swedish: ''Proletär kampvilja'' the latter from ''kamp'' meaning ''fight'' and ''vilja'' meaning ''will'') by Albin Amelin that hangs in the dining room is also a gift. The Amelin family wanted it to be displayed in a prominent place where many socialist supporters and members could view it.
* A copy of Carl Elds' sculpture “[[Youth]]” is exhibited while the original is left in the National museum.
* Folke Allards' [[aquarelle]] "Bommersvik i sommarskrud" (translated as: ''Bommersvik in summer clothes'') is also a gift.
* “Light and mood” by [[Gösta Werner (painter)]] is an [[abstract painting]] and an attempt to expand artistic horizons and to depart from the tradition of [[socialist realism]].
* Sculptor [[Willy Gordon]] created "The meeting" in [[Scale model|miniature]] and the original exists in [[Östermalmstorg]] in Stockholm. ''The meeting,'' ({{lang-sv|Mötet}}), is a controversial group of two modern sculptures representing a naked male figure bearing a piece of meat on his shoulders before a recumbent female figure.
* Ely Maoz, a well-known artist from [[Chile]], painted a picture that hangs on a wall of the wing together with some SSU members' paintings. The painting is called "Freedom for all and Peace for the whole world". It was given to the school as a gesture of appreciation since the SSU criticized the [[Augusto Pinochet|dictatorship in Chile]].

==Symbolic value==
[[Image:Tage Erlander, Bommersvik 1948.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tage Erlander]] ( Prime Minister of Sweden from 1946 to 1969.) dictating a letter to his secretary Maria Nyström in the natural surroundings of Bommersvik. Summer 1948.]]
Bommersvik possesses symbolic value for social democrats worldwide, and has become something of a socialist [[Mecca]] for them. This is also true for those who choose to tie the knot in Bommersvik. For example, two famous locals, Roger Möller and Gerd married there in 1978. Roger Möller later went on to become manager of the school. Many high echelon social democratic party officials have traditionally visited the place and many important meetings were scheduled in Bommersvik. Decisions such as, for example about ATP, have been discussed and analyzed at Bommersvik.

Bommersvik is a place that is a [[sanctuary]] and a source of inspiration for many, while also providing a recreation haven for social democrats. SSU member Lotta Axelsson described Bommersvik this way: ''Bommersvik inspires new ideas, and provides possibilities for recreation and strolling in a natural setting and for rest. There is actually little discussion about socialist issues during leisure activities, as visitors long for going back to nature.''

Social democrat [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] and government ministers come to Bommersvik when they need inspiration. For example, [[Ingvar Carlsson]] went to Bommersvik after the assassination of [[Olof Palme]] in order to relax there before presenting his new cabinet and the [[speech from the throne]].

==International conferences==
After the “[[Milan]]” building with its [[:wikt:conference|conference]] and lecture halls and interpreter facilities was completed in 1978 it was natural that the [[Socialist International]] organisation would now book conferences for Bommersvik.&lt;ref name="Milan pictures"&gt;[http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68 Milan pictures from the Bommersvik website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828004622/http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68 |date=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Milan building and its facilities were inaugurated during the European Labor movement's conference in 1979, with a return engagement in 1985. Both conferences were convened by Palme, the Social Democratic Party leader. Many famous social democrats from other countries have visited Bommersvik through the years, including [[Shimon Peres]], [[Neil Kinnock]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], [[Kalevi Sorsa]], [[Mário Soares]], [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Bruno Kreisky]]. In addition, many other international conferences have also been held there, such as, for example, the [[International Union of Socialist Youth#IUSY Congresses|1989 congress]] of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] and the 2003 congress of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ([[ECOSY]]). Anders Lindberg became the first Swedish president of ECOSY when he was elected by this congress.

==The Bommersvik Declarations==
Bommersvik played a central role in [[international politics]] in 1995 and 2002 when the two conventions of the Elected [[Legislature|Representatives]] of the [[Myanmar|Union of Burma]] took place and the following two landmark declarations were issued:&lt;ref name="Burma Library"&gt;[http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199507/msg00263.html Burma Library website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landmark Declarations from Burma Lawyers' Council"&gt;[http://www.blc-burma.org/html/Declaration%20treaty%20agreements/bsdeclara2.html Burma Lawyers' Council characterizes Declarations as Landmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bommersvik Declaration I===
In 1995, during the first convention that lasted from 16–23 July, the [[National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma|Representatives]] issued the ''Bommersvik [[Declaration of independence|Declaration]] I'' with the following preamble:&lt;ref name="Bommersvik Declaration from NCGUB website"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_1995# |title=Bommersvik Declaration from NCGUB website |access-date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070916/http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_1995# |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''We, the representatives of the people of Burma, elected in 27 May 1990 general elections, meeting at the First Convention of Elected Representatives from the liberated areas of Burma, hereby – Warmly welcome the unconditional release of 1991 [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace laureate]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi|Daw Aung San Suu Kyi]] on 10 July 1995; Thank all who have worked tirelessly and consistently for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the cause of democracy in Burma; Applaud Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's determination, in spite of having spent 6 years under house arrest, to continue to work to bring true democracy to Burma; Welcome Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's return to politics to take up the mantle of her father, General [[Aung San]], in Burma's second struggle for independence;...''|The Elected Representatives of the Union of Burma}}

===Bommersvik Declaration II===
In 2002, during the second convention that lasted from 25 February to 1 March, the Representatives issued the ''Bommersvik Declaration II'' with the following introduction:&lt;ref name="Bommersvik Declaration ΙΙ from NCGUB website"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_2002# |title=Bommersvik Declaration ΙΙ from NCGUB website |access-date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070823/http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_2002# |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''We, the representatives of the people of Burma, elected in 27 May 1990 general elections presently serving as members of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and/or the members of parliament Union, meeting at the Convention of Elected Representatives held in Bommersvik for the second time, hereby reaffirm – Our Mandate, Position, and Strategic Objectives – that we will never ignore the will of the Burmese people expressed through the May 1990 general elections; – that the military's refusal to honor the election results does not in any way diminish the validity of these results.....''|The Elected Representatives of the Union of Burma}}

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
The [[carbon cycle]] is the process by which carbon is exchanged between the four reservoirs of carbon: the  [[biosphere]], the earth, the [[air]] and water. Exchanges take place in several ways, including [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[transpiration]], [[combustion]], and [[decomposition]]. The carbon balance, or [[carbon budget]],  is the balance of exchange  between the four reservoirs.

Debate about 're-balancing the carbon cycle' arises from a concern that use of [[fossil fuels]], which has accelerated since the start of the [[industrial revolution]], has caused carbon to accumulate in the atmosphere. Levels of  [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the atmosphere are estimated to have risen from 280 ppm to almost 400 ppm since 1800 and this is linked to [[global warming]]. It is therefore argued that the carbon cycle should be re-balanced by reducing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.

'Carbon cycle re-balancing' is a useful name for a group of environmental policies listed below. The name gives a specific reason for adopting these policies. Related names, including pleas for [[sustainable development]] and participation in the [[green movement]] are politics-based rather than science-based.

*[[Carbon offset]] - for example by photosynthesis (e.g. in new forests)
*[[Carbon capture and storage]] - extraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and placing it underground or underwater
*Carbon capture and transformation - extraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reacting it with hydrogen via renewable energy electrolysis to create methane as an energy store/carrier. Low to neutral {{CO2}} cycle
*[[Sustainable energy]] - a shift from fossil fuels energy to [[wind power]] and [[solar power]] 
*[[Nuclear power]] - as an alternative to fossil fuels
*[[Sustainable design]] - to reduce inputs and outputs of energy
*[[Sustainable transport]] - to reduce reliance on fossil fuels

Burning domestic refuse to generate power can be promoted as a [[recycling]], and therefore sustainable, [[policy]]. But from a carbon cycle re-balancing standpoint it is better to [[compost]] as much domestic refuse as possible.

[[File:Chain_of_trust.svg|lang=en|thumb|400px|The roles of root certificate, intermediate certificate and end-entity certificate as in the chain of trust.]]
In computer security, a '''chain of trust''' is established by validating each component of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] from the end entity up to the root certificate.  It is intended to ensure that only trusted software and hardware can be used while still retaining flexibility.

==Introduction==
A chain of trust is designed to allow multiple users to create and use software on the system, which would be more difficult if all the keys were stored directly in hardware. It starts with hardware that will only boot from software that is [[Digital signature|digitally signed]].  The signing authority will only sign boot programs that enforce security, such as only running programs that are themselves signed, or only allowing signed code to have access to certain features of the machine. This process may continue for several layers.

This process results in a chain of trust. The final software can be trusted to have certain properties, because if it had been illegally modified its signature would be invalid, and the previous software would not have executed it. The previous software can be trusted, because it, in turn, would not have been loaded if its signature had been invalid. The trustworthiness of each layer is guaranteed by the one before, back to the [[trust anchor]].

It would be possible to have the hardware check the suitability (signature) for every single piece of software. However, this would not produce the flexibility that a "chain" provides. In a chain, any given link can be replaced with a different version to provide different properties, without having to go all the way back to the trust anchor. This use of multiple layers is an application of a general technique to improve scalability, and is analogous to the use of multiple certificates in a [[Root certificate|certificate chain]].

==Computer security==
In computer security, digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the root [[certificate authority]] (CA).

The certificate hierarchy is a structure of certificates that allows individuals to verify the validity of a certificate's issuer. Certificates are issued and signed by certificates that reside higher in the certificate hierarchy, so the validity and trustworthiness of a given certificate is determined by the corresponding validity of the certificate that signed it.

The chain of trust of a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an end-user subscriber certificate and [[intermediate certificate authority|intermediate certificates]] (that represents the intermediate CA), that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all intermediate certificates are trustworthy. This process is best described in the page ''[[Intermediate certificate authority]]''. See also [[X.509#Certificate chains and cross-certification|X.509 certificate chains]] for a description of these concepts in a widely used standard for digital certificates.

'''Choquequirao''' (possibly from [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''chuqi'' metal, ''k'iraw'' [[infant bed|crib]], cot)&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) (5-vowel-system)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref Bertonio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Inca Empire|Incan]] site in south [[Peru]], similar in structure and architecture to [[Machu Picchu]]. The ruins are buildings and terraces at levels above and below Sunch'u Pata, the truncated hill top. The hilltop was anciently leveled and ringed with stones to create a 30 by 50&amp;nbsp;m platform.

Choquequirao at an elevation of {{convert|3050|m|ft}} &lt;ref name="promperu"/&gt;) is in the spurs of the [[Vilcabamba mountain range|Vilcabamba]] mountain range in  the Santa Teresa district,  [[Anta Province|La Convención Province]] of the [[Cusco Region]]. The complex is 1,800&amp;nbsp;hectares, of which 30–40% is excavated.&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"/&gt; The site overlooks the [[Apurimac River]] canyon which has an elevation of {{convert|1450|m|ft}}.

The site is reached by a two-day hike from outside [[Cusco]].&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/285557/ruinas-choquequirao-ultimo-refugio-inca Trail to Choquequirao, El Comercio Newspaper, Lima, Peru, May 13, 2009, [Spanish&amp;#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416055304/http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/285557/ruinas-choquequirao-ultimo-refugio-inca |date=April 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Choquequirao has topped in the prestigious  Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2017 Top Regions list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/noticia-peru-choquequirao-tops-lonely-planets-best-in-travel-2017-list-637078.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Choquequirao is a 15th and 16th century settlement associated with the Inca Empire, or more correctly [[Tahuantinsuyo]].&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; The site had two major growth stages. This could be explained if [[Pachacuti]] founded Choquequirao and his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Tupac Inca Yupanqui]], remodeled and extended it after becoming the [[Sapa Inca]].&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;  Choquequirao is located in the area considered to be Pachacuti’s estate; which includes the areas around the rivers Amaybamba, Urabamba, Vilcabamba, Victos and Apurímac. Other sites in this area are [[Sayhuite]], [[Machu Picchu]], Chachabamba ''(Chachapampa)'', Choquesuysuy ''(Chuqisuyuy)'' and Guamanmarca ''(Wamanmarka)''; all of which share similar architectural styles with Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The architectural style of several important features appears to be of [[Chachapoya]] design, suggesting that Chachapoya workers were probably involved in the construction. This suggests that Tupaq Inka probably ordered the construction. Colonial documents also suggest that Tupac Inca ruled Choquequirao since his great grandson, Tupa Sayri, claimed ownership of the site and neighboring lands during Spanish colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the last bastions of resistance and refuge of the Son of the Sun (the "Inca"), [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], who fled [[Cusco]] after his siege of the city failed in 1535.

According to the Peruvian Tourism Office, "Choquequirao was probably one of the entrance check points to the [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], and also an administrative hub serving political, social and economic functions. Its urban design has followed the symbolic patterns of the imperial capital, with ritual places dedicated to ''[[Inti]]'' (the Incan sun god) and the ancestors, to the earth, water and other divinities, with mansions for administrators and houses for artisans, warehouses, large dormitories or kallankas and farming terraces belonging to the Inca or the local people. Spreading over 700 meters, the ceremonial area drops as much as 65 meters from the elevated areas to the main square."&lt;ref name="promperu"&gt;[http://www.peru.travel/en/culture/archaeology/choquequirao-1122-2-567-4.1.14 Choquequirao, Peru's Tourism Office, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The city also played an important role as a link between the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]] and the city of [[Cusco]].

=== Discovery ===
According to Ethan Todras-Whitehill of the New York Times, Choquequirao's first non-Incan visitor was the [[explorer]] [[Juan Arias Díaz]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/travel/03inca.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 Ethan Todras-Whitehill on the New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The first written site reference in 1768 was made by [[Cosme Bueno]], but was ignored at the time.

The Prefect of the Province of Apurimac, J.J. Nuñez, encouraged [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] to visit the 'Cradle of Gold', in order to discover any Incan treasure.  Bingham was a delegate to the 1908 First Pan American Scientific Congress and was in Cusco at the time.  Bingham decided to visit Choquequirao in 1909 to determine if it was [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcapampa]], the Capital of the last four Incas.  He found three groups of buildings, mummified bodies, and places where dynamite had been used in the search of treasure.  Visitors who had recorded their names included Count de Sartiges, Jose Maria Tejada and Marcelino Leon, 1834, Jose Benigno Samanez, Juan Manuel Rivas Plata and Mariana Cisneros, 1861, and three Almanzas, Pio Mogrovejo, and their treasure hunting workmen, 1885.  However, Bingham decided it was merely a frontier fortress, and tempted him to search further.&lt;ref name="Hiram"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Hiram|title=Lost City of the Incas|date=1952|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=9781842125854|pages=112–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and layout ==
Choquequirao is situated at an elevation of 3,000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level on a southwest-facing spur of a glaciated peak above the [[Apurimac River]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The region is characterized by mountain topography and covered with Amazonian flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is 98&amp;nbsp;km west of Cusco, in the Vilcabamba range. The complex covers 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally it is similar to Machu Picchu. The main structures, such as temples, [[huaca]]s, elite residences, and fountain/bath systems are concentrated around two plazas along the crest of the ridge, which encompass approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and follow Inca urban design. Also there is a conglomeration of common buildings clustered away from the plaza. Excavations and surface items suggest they were probably used for workshops and food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings are well-preserved and well-restored; restoration continues.

The terrain around the site was greatly modified. The central area of the site was leveled artificially and the surrounding hillsides were terraced to allow cultivation and small residential areas.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"/&gt; The typical Inca terraces form the largest constructions on site.

Many of the ceremonial structures are associated with water. There are two unusual temple ''wak'a'' sites that lie several hundred meters lower than the two plazas. These are carefully crafted step terraces down a steep slope are designed around water.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The site also contains a number of ceremonial structures such as the large ''[[ushnu|usnu]]'' built on a truncates hill, the Giant Staircase, and an aqueduct providing water to the water shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectors===
The archaeological complex of Choquequirao is divided into 12 sectors. While the contents of each sector are different, terraces used for various purposes are common throughout. It seems that most of the buildings here were either for ceremonial purposes, residences of the priests, or used to store food.
    
* Sector I is the highest and most northerly portion of the site. There exist 5 buildings constructed on terraces at varying levels, a temple and a plaza, as well as a smaller plaza in the uppermost area of the sector. Two of the buildings appear to be ''[[qullqa]]s'' (warehouses). The three long buildings, called ''kallankas'' were likely priests’ residences.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel.(2008). p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector II is where a majority of the ''qullqanpatas'', or depositories are located. In one part of this sector there are 16 ceremonial platforms with canal routes in between that branch off from the main water way.&lt;ref name="Burga"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector III is between the ''hanan'' (high) area and the ''urin'' (low) area of the complex and contains what is believed to be the Haucaypata ''(Hawkaypata)'', or main plaza. At the periphery of the plaza there are one story and two story buildings. To the north, there is a ''Sunturwasi'' and a single level ''kallanka'' likely used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; To the east are the buildings with two levels. The main plaza is discussed in more detail in the section called '''Ceremonial Center''' of this page.
* Sector IV is located in the southerly area of the complex, known as the ''urin'' zone. The main building here has walls that were probably ceremonial in function since one of them is known as “wall of offerings to the ancestors”.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt;
* Sector V is the location of the ''usnu'' which is a hill leveled at the summit to form an oval platform used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; A small wall encircles the hill. From the platform, one can see the main plaza of sector III, the snowcapped mountains and the Apurímac River.
* Sector VI, south of the ''usnu'' in the ''urin'' area, it has the ''Wasi Kancha'' ("house yard"), also known as the priests' quarters. There are four terraces here that were used as ceremonial space.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In the walls of the terraces there is a zigzagged design.
* Sector VII can be reached from the main plaza by pathway. Located on the east side of Choquequirao, this zone contains cultivation terraces that have markedly greater amplitude than all others throughout the complex.
* Sector VIII, on the western side of the complex, has 80 cultivation terraces divided into plots by water canals that stream down from the main plaza. In this zone, one will find the famous "Llamas del Sol".&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector IX contains general living quarters for groups of people, such as workers or families. The buildings are constructed on top of artificial platforms in circular and rectangular design, interconnected by stairways and narrow alleys.
* Sector X, called ''paraqtepata'', has 18 terraced platforms that have irrigation canals running parallel to the stairs.&lt;ref name="manuel"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector XI has 80 terraces used for cultivation, called ''phaqchayuq'' ("the one with a waterfall"), which are the most extensive in the entire complex.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt; Also found here are small, quadrilateral enclosures with two levels used for both ceremony and living. Outside, there are three water fountains used for drinking and to supply the irrigation canals.
* Sector XII lies three hours away (by foot) from the upper part of the complex. Here there are 57 platforms with permanent irrigation systems. In the uppermost terraces there are buildings for ceremony and a pool of water fed by a spring. In the semicircular enclosures ceramic shards, stone tools and remains of bones have been found.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt;

===Ceremonial center===
The ceremonial center of Choquequirao shares many features similar to those of other Inca ceremonial centers and pilgrimage sites, such as Isla del Sol, Quespiwanka (''Qhispi Wank'a'', palace of [[Huayna Capac]]), Machu Picchu/[[Llaqtapata]], [[Tipon]] and Saywite. The long and treacherous route from Cusco to Choquequirao likely passed by Machu Picchu, leading onto the face of Machu Picchu Peak. From Llaqtapata, the path continued down into the Mollepata Valley, traversed the Yanamia pass at 4670 m, and continued across the Rio Blanco, finally reaching Choquequirao from above after an estimated 7- to 10-day journey.&lt;ref name=Malville&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremonial center consists of a main platform and a lower plaza. Stone lined channels carried ceremonial water, or chicha to shrines and baths throughout the site. The main platform, unique in its size and prominence, limited ceremonial activity to royalty and the ministerial class. This seems as such due to evidence showing that the only entrance to the platform was through a double-jam doorway, which functioned to control access to the sacred space.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Other features of the ceremonial center include structures that mark the direction of certain solar events, such as when the June and December solstice sun rises and sets.
 
Located in the main platform, the Giant Stairway opens to the sunrise of the December solstice. Measured at 25 meters long and 4.4 meters wide, this structure seems to have been purely ceremonial in function, since the stairs end abruptly partway down a hill, leading to nothing. Large boulders that rest upon the risers of the stairway become fully illuminated when the December solstice sun rises. Gary R. Ziegler and J. McKim Malville have postulated that when the boulders become illuminated, a ''wak'a'' is activated by its solar camaquen—a case similar to when the large stone of the Torreon at Machu Picchu becomes illuminated.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt;
 
In the lower plaza a group of structures were found that appeared to be water shrines and baths. This belief is held based on their strong resemblance to those at sector II of Llaqtapata and because there are numerous water channels leading to that portion of the plaza.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Overall, it seems as though the site was chosen, as Machu Picchu was, for its sacred geographical location, and was designed to facilitate ritual and ceremonial activity.

===Subsectors===
The area around Choquequiaro contains several subsectors that have been associated with the Inca culture that thrived in Choquequirao, suggesting that the subsectors are most likely part of the site. Design, construction style, and cultural parallels support that these sectors were tightly intertwined with Choquequiaro and the Inca at some point in their history. The lack of residential space in these sectors suggests that these were probably farming outposts from Choquequirao rather than an independent site.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to differences in design and construction styles, it is believed that these sectors were built in three different phases.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Choquequirao art style, the subsector also contains multiple camelid art and ceremonial ''phaqchas'' that are tightly related to Inca, especially Pachacuti’s government.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
All lithic materials utilized for the construction of the site and surrounding sectors were mined from the local quarries.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[metamorphic rock]] in the quarries of Choquequirao, superb masonry like that at Machu Picchu could not be obtained. Instead, the entrances and corners were shaped from [[quartzite]], and the walls were made of achlar and plastered with clay and then painted in a light orange color.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Most of the rock art in Choquequirao is in the terraced area where cultivation occurred. Archaeologists have documented twenty-five semi-naturalistic figures on the terraces of sector VIII of Choquequirao. The rocks used to build the walls are dark [[schist]] while the camelid images are of white [[calcocuarcita]], a sandstone of quartz and carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, pp.214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; The camelid motifs vary between a maximum height of 1.94&amp;nbsp;m and one minimum of 1.25&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, archaeologist Zenobio Valencia from the University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco found several camelid figurines made of white stones in a group of terraces in one sector of the archaeological site.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"/&gt;

One recent discovery for example, uncovered a scene laid into the stone terraces with white quartzite depicting several llamas loaded with cargo standing by their handlers. Present on the uppermost terrace wall is a zigzag pattern of the same quartzite. This style of design is uniquely [[Chachapoya]] and not found in other sites of Inca construction, indicating that workers from Chachapoya may have been involved in the construction of Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
Presently the only way to access Choquequirao is by a hard hike. The common trail head begins at the village of San Pedro de Cachora,&lt;ref name="Horizon Guides"&gt;[https://horizontravelpress.com/guides/trekking-to-machu-picchu-013 Trekking To Machu Picchu, Horizon Guides, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately a 4-hour drive from Cuzco, along the Cusco-Abancay route. Another access point is from Huanipaca village, whose crossroad is located on the same route Cusco-Abancay, 4–5&amp;nbsp;km beyond the Cachora crossroad. Huanipaca offers a 15&amp;nbsp;km trail, half distance less than Cachora trail (31&amp;nbsp;km). Over 5,000 people trekked to Choquequirao in 2013. From Choquequirao it is possible to continue hiking to Machu Picchu. Most treks range from 7-day to 11-day hikes, and involve going over the Yanama Pass, which at 4,668&amp;nbsp;m is the highest point on the trek.

The construction of the cable car to Choquequirao has been declared a priority by the [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac Regional Government]], which are destined to receive 220 million Peruvian Soles (US$82.7 million) to fund the project. It will reduce a two-day hike to a 15-minute cable car ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salazar|first=Carla|title=Tramway planned for Machu Picchu’s ‘sister city’|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tramway-planned-machu-picchus-sister-city-065213029.html|work=AP Travel|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Canales, president of the National Chamber of Tourism (Canatur) believes that in the first year of operation the Choquequirao cable car will receive 200,000 tourists, which will generate an income of US$4 million, with the average visitor paying US$20 per ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Choquequirao recibiría 600 mil viajeros en el 2018 con teleférico|url=http://elcomercio.pe/turismo/1506503/noticia-apurimac-recibiria-600-mil-viajeros-2018-gracias-teleferico-choquequirao?ft=grid|newspaper=El Comercio|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pooh sticks bridge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Poohsticks]] Bridge in [[Ashdown Forest]], an area of common land.]]
'''Common land'''  is land owned collectively by a number of persons, or by one person, but over which other people have certain traditional rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, to collect wood, or to cut turf for fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape/protection/historiccultural/commonland/default.aspx Natural England].&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a '''commoner'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article deals mainly with '''common land''' in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. Although the extent there is much reduced due to [[enclosure]] of common land from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century, a considerable amount of common land still exists, particularly in upland areas, and there are over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref name="callander"&gt;{{harvnb|Callander|1987|p=???}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common land or former common land is usually referred to as a '''common'''; for instance, [[Clapham Common]] or [[Mungrisdale Common]].

==Origins==
[[File:Pannage in the New Forest.JPG|thumb|Modern-day [[pannage]], or common of mast, in the New Forest]]
[[File:Medieval Open Field System.JPG|thumb|Conjectural map of a mediaeval English [[manor]]. The part allocated to "common pasture" is shown in the north-east section, shaded green.]]
Originally in medieval [[England]] the common was an integral part of the [[manor]], and was thus part of the [[estate in land|estate]] held by the lord of the manor under a feudal grant from the Crown or a superior peer, who in turn held his land from the Crown which owned all land. This manorial system, founded on feudalism, granted rights of land use to different classes. These would be ''[[appurtenant]]'' rights,&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/appurtenant Legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; that is the ownership of rights belonged to tenancies of particular plots of land held within a [[manor]]. A commoner would be the person who, for the time being, was the occupier of a particular plot of land. Some rights of common were said to be ''[[easement|in gross]]'', that is, they were unconnected with tenure of land.  This was more usual in regions where commons are more extensive, such as in the high ground of Northern England or on the [[the Fens|Fens]], but also included many [[village green]]s across England and Wales. Most land with appurtenant commons rights is adjacent to the common or even surrounded by it, but in a few cases it may be some considerable distance away.

Historically [[Manorial court]]s defined the details of many of the rights of common allowed to manorial tenants, and such rights formed part of the [[copyhold]] tenancy whose terms were defined in the manorial court roll.

Example rights of common are:

* [[Pasture]]. Right to pasture cattle, horses, sheep or other animals on the common land.  The most widespread right.
* Piscary. Right to fish.
* [[Turbary]]. Right to take sods of turf for fuel.
* Common in the Soil. This is a general term used for rights to extract minerals such as sands, gravels, marl, walling stone and lime from common land.
* Mast or [[pannage]]. Right to turn out pigs for a period in autumn to eat mast ([[beech]] mast, acorns and other nuts).
* [[Estovers]]. Right to take sufficient wood for the commoner's house or holding; usually limited to smaller trees, bushes (such as [[gorse]]) and fallen branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newforestexplorersguide.co.uk/sitefolders/commoning/marl%20turbary%20sheep/marl%20turbary%20sheep%20page.html New Forest explorers guide].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/Planning/LandAndPropertyDevelopment/DG_10026177 UK government].&lt;/ref&gt;

On most commons, rights of [[pasture]] and [[pannage]] for each commoner are tightly defined by number and type of animal, and by the time of year when certain rights could be exercised.  For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen [[cattle]], four [[horse]]s, [[pony|ponies]] or [[donkey]]s, and fifty [[geese]], whilst the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different.  On some commons (such as the [[New Forest]] and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a ''marking fee'' is paid each year for each animal ''turned out''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verderers.org.uk/rights.html Forest rights].&lt;/ref&gt; However, if excessive use was made of the common, for example, in overgrazing, a common would be ''stinted'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" Journal of Environmental Ethics, Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further.

The Lord of the Manor must only exercise his rights so far as to leave a "sufficiency" of resource for commoners. This was at Issue in 1889 when the Lord of the Manor and owner of Banstead Downs and Heath, a Mr Hartopp, exacavated gravel and threatened to reduce the available pasture.  The meaning of sufficiency was challenged in court, Expert winesses stated that the grazing capacity was 1200 animals, the commoners rights totalled 1440 animals, and 600 animals were normally turned out. It was decided sufficiency was whether enough grazing would be available for all the animals that could be turned out. The judgement was that "The Lord is bound to leave pasture enough to satisfy the commoners rights whether such rights are to be exercised or not". Commoners also have the right to "peaceful enjoyment" of their rights, so that they cannot be hindered by the Lord of the Manor. This was first proposed in 1500 and became case law in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to the Law of Commons. Ian Campbell LLB. Open Spaces Society 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of common==

===Pasture commons===
[[Pasture]] commons are those where the primary right is to pasture [[livestock]]. In the uplands, they are largely [[moorland]], on the coast they may be [[salt marsh]], [[sand dune]]s or [[cliff]]s, and on inland lowlands they may be [[downland]], [[grassland]], [[heathland]] or [[wood pasture]], depending on the soil and history. These habitats are often of very high [[nature conservation]] value, because of their very long continuity of management extending in some cases over many hundreds of years. In the past, most pasture commons would have been grazed by mixtures of cattle, sheep and ponies (often also geese).  The modern survival of grazing on pasture commons over the past century is uneven.&lt;ref name="Impacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/cceec/impactsofenvironmentalchange/impacts_of_grazing.html |title=Impacts of grazing on lowland heathland |publisher=[[Bournemouth University]] |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arable and haymeadow commons===
Surviving commons are almost all pasture, but in earlier times, [[arable land|arable]] farming and [[hay]]making were significant, with strips of land in the [[Open field system|common arable fields]] and common haymeadows assigned annually by [[Sortition|lot]].  When not in use for those purposes, such commons were [[graze]]d.  Examples include the common arable fields around the village of [[Laxton, Nottinghamshire#Open Fields|Laxton]] in Nottinghamshire, and a common meadow at [[North Meadow, Cricklade]].

===Lammas rights===
''Lammas rights'' entitled commoners to pasture following the harvest, between [[Lammas]] day, 12 August ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]), to 6 April, even if they did not have other rights to the land. Such rights sometimes had the effect of preventing enclosure and building development on agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Evelyn |last=Pritchard |title=The Historical Background |year=2000 |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Chave |work=Ham and Petersham at 2000 |publisher=Ham Amenities Group |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enclosure and decline==
{{main article|Enclosure}}
Most of the medieval common land of England was lost due to enclosure. In English social and economic history, '''enclosure''' or '''inclosure''' is the process which ends traditional rights such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]], or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land formerly held in the [[open field system]]. Once enclosed, these uses of the land become restricted to the owner, and it ceases to be land for the use of commoners.  In [[England and Wales]] the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of [[Tillage|arable farming]] in [[open field system|open fields]]. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (''enclosed'') and ''deeded'' or ''entitled'' to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to large areas of rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small residual parcels of land in the lowlands.

Enclosure could be accomplished by buying the ground rights and all common rights to accomplish exclusive rights of use, which increased the value of the land.  The other method was by passing laws causing or forcing enclosure, such as Parliamentary enclosure.  The latter process of enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of [[agricultural]] and [[economics|economic]] [[history]] in England.

Enclosure is considered one of the causes of the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].  Enclosed land was under control of the farmer who was free to adopt better farming practices.  There was widespread agreement in contemporary accounts that profit making opportunities were better with enclosed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following enclosure, crop yields and livestock output increased while at the same time productivity increased enough to create a surplus of labour.  The increased labour supply is considered one of the factors facilitating the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The transformation if the agrarian economy 1500–1850 |last=Overton |first=Mark |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-56859-3 |pages= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the era of enclosure, there was relatively little common land remaining of value. Some residual commoners remained, until such as after the Second World War, lowland commons became neglected because commoners could find better-paid work in other sectors of the economy. As a result, they largely stopped exercising their rights, and relatively few commoners exist today.

==Modern use==
Much common land is still used for its original purpose. The right to graze domestic stock is by far the most extensive commoners right registered, and its ongoing use contributes significantly to agricultural and rural economies.  Rights to graze sheep are registered on 53% of the Welsh and 16% of the English commons. Cattle are registered on 35% of Welsh and 20% of English commons, whilst horses and ponies are registered on 27% of Welsh and 13% of English commons. In some cases rights to graze goats, geese and ducks are registered, whilst in others the type of livestock is not specified. These figures relate to the number of common land units, and due to discrepancies in the registers and large numbers of small commons with no rights in England, the apparent distinction between Wales and England may be exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land"&gt;[http://www.foundationforcommonland.org.uk/ Foundation for common land]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, despite the diverse legal and historical origins of commons, they are managed through a community of users, comprising those who hold rights together with the owner(s) of the soil. Such communities generally require joint working to integrate all interests, with formal or informal controls and collaborative understandings, often coupled with strong social traditions and local identity.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land" /&gt;

However, 26% of commons in Wales, and as many as 65% in England, have no common rights shown on the registers. Such areas are derived from [[manorial waste|wastes of manors]], where rights probably existed formerly.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land" /&gt; When such open habitats are no longer grazed they revert to scrub and then dense woodland, losing the grassy or heathland vegetation which may have occupied the land continuously for many centuries. In 2007 [[Ashdown Forest]], the Sussex heathland which was the setting for the [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] stories, became the centre of a dispute between some local residents and the Forest's governing body, the Board of Conservators, which is responsible for administering the Forest's {{convert|2,400|ha}} of common land. The Conservators wished to restore the Forest's landscape to one that predominantly consisted of heathland—its defining characteristic until the mid-twentieth century, but something that was in danger of being lost after the Second World War as a result of the advance of woodland into traditional heathland areas when, as one commentator stated..

{{quote|...returning soldiers gave up trying to scratch a living out of the forest. Whereas once hundreds of commoners used the wood and heath—their livestock obliging by chewing down young tree shoots—today there is only one commercial grazer.{{sfn|Brown|2007}} }}

The Conservators were forced to intervene to stem the invasion of trees, scrub and bracken that threatened the ecologicially precious heathlands, cutting down saplings, removing scrub and mowing the bracken. Some residents complained that the results looked like a First World War battle field. This is not a problem restricted to this common, but according to Jonathan Brown writing in the Independent on 21 April 2007 "similar debates are raging between locals and the authorities at other heathland areas in the New Forest and Surrey".{{sfn|Brown|2007}}

In 2008 the Foundation for Common Land was created in the UK to  try to enhance the understanding and protection of commons.&lt;ref&gt;[Bathe, Graham "Common Land" .Pitkin. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing law in England and Wales==
The legal position concerning common land has been confused, but recent legislation has sought to remedy this and remove the legal uncertainties so that commons can be better used and protected.

Most commons are based on ancient rights under British [[common law]], which pre-date [[statute]]s passed by the [[Parliament of England]]. The exact rights which apply to individual commons were in some cases documented, but more often were based on long-held traditions. A major reform began in 1965, with a national register of common land which recorded the land ownership and the rights of any commoners, and two other important statutes have followed.

Owners of land in general have all the rights of exclusive ownership, to use the land as they wish. However, for common land the owner's rights are restricted, and other people known as commoners have certain rights over the land.  The landowner may retain other rights to the land, such as rights to minerals and large timber, and to any common rights left unexercised by the commoners. The commoners will  continue to exercise their rights, or have a document which describes their rights, which may be part of the deeds of another property. A number of commoners still exercise rights, for example, there are 500&amp;nbsp;practising commoners in the [[New Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newforestcommoners.co.uk/ New Forest commoners]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a federation of commoners in [[Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Federation of Cumbrian Commoners website – retrieved Nov 2014 [Cumbria http://www.cumbriacommoners.org.uk/commons-councils]&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases commons have no existing commoners, the rights having been neglected.

===Erection of Cottages Act 1588===
There  was a belief that if an Englishman or woman could—between sunrise and sunset in a single day—build a house on common land, raise the roof over their head and light a fire in the hearth, then they would have the right of undisturbed possession.&lt;ref name=Harrison135&gt;Harrison. The Common People. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The belief—sometimes called "keyhole tenure", and which persisted as recently as the early 20th century—was actually a fallacy, but to stop landless peasants unlawfully squatting on commons, an act known as the [[Erection of Cottages Act 1588]] (31 Eliz c. 7, long title "An Act against the erecting and maintaining of Cottages"), was introduced.&lt;ref name=Harrison135 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lure of the New Forest|first=Elizabeth|last=Croly|location=Richmond|publisher=Mills &amp; Boon|year=1925|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Law Notes, Vol.43|first=Abraham|last=Williams|location=London|publisher=Reeves &amp; Turner|year=1924|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statute664&gt;Basket. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA664 Statutes at Large.] p. 664&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commons Act 1876===
Under the Commons Act 1876 some 36 commons in England and Wales were regulated. The act also enabled the confirmation of Orders providing for the inclosure of common land or common fields.

===Commons Act 1899===
The Commons Act 1899 provides a mechanism of enabling district councils and National Park authorities to manage commons where their use for exercise and recreation is the prime consideration and where the owner and commoners do not require a direct voice in the management, or where the owner cannot be found. There are at least 200 schemes of management made under the 1899 act.

===The Law of Property Act 1925===
The [[Law of Property Act 1925]], which still forms the core of English property law, has two provisions for common land:
* Section 193 gave the right of the public to "air and exercise" on Metropolitan commons and those in pre-1974 urban districts and boroughs. This constituted about one fifth of the commons, but the 1925 Act did not give this right to commons in essentially rural areas (although some urban districts had remarkably rural extent, such as the Lakes Urban District), which had to wait for the 2000 CROW Act.
* Section 194 restricted the inclosure of commons, which would now require Ministerial consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/contents Law of Property Act 1925]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commons Registration Act 1965===
The UK government regularised the definitions of common land with the [[Commons Registration Act 1965]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1965/cukpga_19650064_en_1 Commons Registration Act 1965], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; which established a register of common land.

Not all commons have owners, but all common land by definition is registered under 1965 Commons registration Act, along with the rights of any commoners if they still exist. The registration authorities are the County Councils, and when there is no ownership, a local council, such as a [[parish councils in England|parish council]] is normally given guardianship by vesting the property under the Act (section 8).

An online database of registered common land was compiled by DEFRA in 1992–93 as part of a survey of the condition and wildlife of commons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England compiled 1992–93]&lt;/ref&gt; The official up to date Registers of common land are held by the Commons Registration Authorities.

The following registration information is held:&lt;ref&gt;Cumbria CC website 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Land Section'''

This includes a description of the land, who applied to register the land, and when the land became finally registered. There are also related plans which show the boundaries of the land.

* '''Rights Section'''

This includes a description of the rights of common (e.g. a right to graze a certain number of sheep), the area of common over which the right is exercisable, the name of the holder of the right and whether the right is attached to land in the ownership of the holder of the right (the commoner) or is a right held in gross i.e. unattached to land.

* '''Ownership Section'''

This includes details of the owner(s) of the common land. Entries in this section however, are not held to be conclusive.

Unfortunately, numerous inconsistencies and irregularities remained, mainly because a period of only 3 years was given for registration submissions. However, there is there is now an opportunity to clear these up under the 2006 Act, and to add land omitted under the 1965 act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commonland/court.htm Defra], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW)===
Other than for those commons covered by the Law of Property Act 1925, the Commons Act 1899 and certain other statutes, the public did not have the right to use or enjoy common land if they were not a commoner. However, the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] gave the public the [[Freedom to roam]] freely on all registered common land in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/access/openaccess/default.aspx |publisher=Natural England |title=Open Access land |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced, and are available online as "open access maps" produced by Natural England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openaccess.naturalengland.org.uk/wps/portal/oasys/maps/MapSearch Open access maps at Natural England]&lt;/ref&gt; Commons are included in the public access land now shown on the [[Ordnance Survey]] Explorer Maps.

===Commons Act 2006===
The Commons Act 2006 is an important recent piece of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/26/section/15 Commons act 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act:

* Enables commons to be managed more sustainably by commoners and landowners working together through commons councils with powers to regulate grazing and other agricultural activities
* Provides better protection for common land and greens – this includes reinforcing existing protections against abuse, encroachment and unauthorised development
* Recognises that the protection of common land has to be proportionate to the harm caused and that some specified works can be carried out without the need for consent
* Requires commons registration authorities to bring their registers up-to-date by recording past changes affecting the registers during a ‘transitional period’, and to keep the registers up-to-date by recording new changes affecting the registers – commons registration authorities will have new powers to correct many of the mistakes in the registers
* Sets out new, clearer criteria for the registration of town or village greens
* Prohibits the severance of rights of common grazing, preventing commoners from selling, leasing or letting their rights away from the property to which rights are attached,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/common-land-management-protection-and-registering-to-use HMG Guide to the 2006 act]&lt;/ref&gt; though temporary severance of such rights is permitted &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2145/contents/made The Commons (Severance of Rights) (England) Order 2006][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2014/219/contents/made The Commons (Severance of Rights) (Wales) Order 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; for renewable terms of up to two years (in England) and five years (in Wales).&lt;ref&gt;[Natural England "Commons Toolkit" NE 285]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred square kilometres of ‘waste land’ that was provisionally registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965 was not, in fact, finally registered. As a consequence, it ceased to be recognised as common land. A partial remedy for this defect in the earlier legislation is provided by the Commons Act 2006. Under Schedule 2(4) to the Act, applications that failed to achieve final registration under the 1965 Act may, in certain circumstances, be reconsidered – offering, in effect, a second chance for the land to be confirmed (‘re-registered’) as common. Land that is re-registered in this way will enjoy the special legal protection afforded to common land. It will also become subject in due course to the public right of access introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000; or depending on location, may qualify as a section 193 ‘urban’ common (in which case, it would also be subject to a right of access for horse-riders).&lt;ref&gt;Open Spaces Society website retrieved Nov 2014 – section on the Commons Act 2006 {{cite web |url=http://www.oss.org.uk/what-we-do/commons/the-commons-act-2006/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127125452/http://www.oss.org.uk/what-we-do/commons/the-commons-act-2006/ |archivedate=27 November 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fencing===
[[File:Wimbledon Windmill.jpg|thumb| The [[Wimbledon Windmill|windmill]] on [[Wimbledon Common]].]]
The act of transferring resources from the commons to purely private ownership is known as ''[[enclosure]]'', or (especially in formal use, and in place names) ''Inclosure''. The [[Inclosure Acts]] were a series of private Acts of Parliament, mainly from about 1750 to 1850, which enclosed large areas of common, especially the arable and haymeadow land and the better pasture land.

The maintenance of fences around a common is the responsibility of the occupiers of the adjacent enclosed land, not (as it would be with enclosed land) the responsibility of the owners of the grazed livestock.  This can lead to difficulties where not all adjacent occupiers maintain their fences properly. However the fencing of land within a registered common is not allowed, as this is a form of enclosure and denies use of the land to others.

A celebrated landmark case of unauthorised fencing of a common was in 1866 by Lord Brownlow who illegally enclosed 434 acres of Berkhamsted Common to add to his [[Ashridge Estate]]. Brownlow had failed to buy out the commoners, so resorted to this action. A public outcry followed, and the Commons Preservation Society found a champion in [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] who had the inclination and the money to act, and himself held commons rights. Smith hired 120 navvies armed with hammers, chisels and crowbars, who on the night of 6 March 1866, under the aegis of the newly formed Commons Preservation Society (now the [[Open Spaces Society]]), felled to the ground two miles of iron railings. Soon after, local people flocked in. Lord Brownlow took action against Augustus Smith and the court case lasted until 1870 when it ended with the complete vindication of Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|first=Kate|last=Ashbrook|work=Open Spaces Society|date=July 2013|url=http://contestedcommons.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controls on development===
Development of common land is strictly controlled. The government states that common land should be open and accessible to the public, and the law restricts the kind of works that can be carried out on commons. HM Planning Inspectorate is responsible for determining applications under the 2006 Act regarding common land in England, and several other pieces of legislation regarding commons and greens. All applications are determined on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).&lt;ref name="UK planning portal"&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/responsibilities/beforeyoustart/otherpermissions/commonland UK planning portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under section 38 of the Commons Act 2006, you need consent to carry out any restricted works on land registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Restricted works are any that
prevent or impede access to or over the land. They include fencing, buildings, structures, ditches, trenches, embankments and other works, where the effect of those works is to prevent or impede access. They also include, in every case, new solid surfaces, such as for a new car park or access road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/countryside/commonland/guidance Guidance on development on common land]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boards of Conservators and Commons Councils===
Some commons are managed by [[Conservators|Boards of Conservators]] for the wider public benefit. However, for areas where these are not established, or an improved system is required, the Commons Act 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060026_en_1 Commons Act 2006], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; provides for the establishment of Commons Councils to manage common land.&lt;ref name="DEFRA"&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/protected-areas/common-land/manage.htm How is Common Land managed?], Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard Constitution Regulations relating to commons councils were formally approved in April 2010, and Commons Councils are most likely to be useful where they can improve current management practices.  This may be where commons are in agricultural use, but where it can be difficult to reach agreement on collective management. Commons Councils are voluntary and can be established only where there is substantial support among those with interests in the land, such as; the Commoners  (especially those who actively exercise their rights); owners and other legal interests.

Commons Councils enable decisions to be made by majority voting, so relieving the burden of trying to reach unanimous decisions.  They will have the power to make rules about agricultural activities, the management of vegetation, and the exercise of common rights, which are binding on all those with interests on a common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumbriacommoners.org.uk/commons-councils Federation of Cumbrian Commoners]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roadways===
[[File:Enclosure Road, Lazonby.jpg|thumb|A parliamentary enclosure road near Lazonby in Cumbria. The roads were made as straight as possible, and the boundaries much wider than a cart width to reduce the ground damage of driving sheep and cattle.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;]]
Commons are often crossed by unfenced public roads, and this leads to another problem on modern pasture commons where grazing survives (or is to be reintroduced).  Historically, the roads would have been [[cart]]-tracks, and there would have been no conflict between their [[horse]]-drawn (or [[ox]]-drawn) traffic and the pastured animals, and no great difficulty if pastured animals wandered off the common along the roads.  However, these roads now have fast motorised traffic which does not mix safely with animals.  To continue (or restore) grazing, such roads may need fencing or at least blocking at the edge of the common with [[cattle grid]]s — however fencing a common is reminiscent of the process of enclosure, historically fatal to its survival, and permission for fencing on a common is a strictly controlled process within the UK planning system.&lt;ref name="UK planning portal" /&gt;

Public roads through enclosed common land were made to an accepted width between boundaries. In the late eighteenth century this was at least {{convert|60|ft}}, but from the 1790s this was decreased to {{convert|40|ft}}, and later {{convert|30|ft}} as the normal maximum width. The reason for these wide roads to was to prevent excessive churning of the road bed, and allow easy movement of flocks and herds of animals.&lt;ref name="whyte"&gt;Transforming Fell and Valley, Ian Whyte. Published by Centre for North West regional Studies, University of Lancaster 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland and Sweden ==
A '''partition unit''' is a [[corporation]] that owns common land. In this case, the land is not state-owned or in joint-ownership under a trust, but is owned by a definite partition unit, a legal [[partnership]] whose partners are the participating individual landowners. Common lands and waterways owned by a partition unit were created by an agreement where certain land was reserved for the common use of all adjacent landowners. For the most part, this was due to the Great Partition (Swedish: [[:sv:storskiftet|storskiftet]], Finnish: [[:fi:isojako|isojako]]), which started in 1757 and was largely complete by the 1800s. Earlier, the land of a village was divided into narrow stripes of farmland for each to own, with the remainder commonly owned, and work on the land was collective. In the Great Partition, villages were organized as corporations termed partition units (Swedish: [[:sv:skifteslag|skifteslag]], Finnish: [[:fi:jakokunta|jakokunta]]), and land was divided into large chunks that were divided among the households (commoners) for individual cultivation and habitation. Land or waterways that remained undivided was kept by the partition unit as commons, owned by the partition unit. Later, [[Gustaf III]] claimed the yet unclaimed forest for the Crown – this was the origin of the large forest holdings of the state in Sweden and Finland. Today, partition units are a common way of owning waterways.

==Scotland==
Commoning has probably existed in Scotland for over a millennium. However, there is no modern legislation relating to commons which formally identifies the extent of common land or clarifies the full range of rights. The right of turbary – the ability to cut peat as fuel – clearly exists in large parts of Scotland, whilst the scale of such rights, and the extent to which they are utilised, remain unknown. The main work undertaken on Scottish commons concerns grazing, using a pragmatic definition, where such commons were defined as pastures with multiple grazing rights and/or multiple graziers.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land" /&gt;

There are seven main historic types of common land in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="callander" /&gt; some of which have similarities to common land in England and Wales.

===Commonties===
The overwhelming majority of areas of common land in lowland Scotland and the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] fringes were ''commonties''. A commonty is an area of land where the rights of [[Real property|property]] or use are shared by two or more neighbouring (though not necessarily adjacent) landowners. They are not therefore truly 'common' land in the sense that anyone can use them, and this distinction meant that it was often very easy for commonties to be divided between landowners after a series of Acts permitting this were passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in the 17th century, most notably the 1695 Act for the Division of Commonties. As a result, the number of commonties declined very rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Common mosses===
Common mosses were areas of [[bog]] where the right to dig [[peat]] for fuel were shared by neighbouring landowners. They are therefore similar to commonties and most commonties included a common moss. However the difficulties of dividing such wet areas meant that they were left out of many commonty divisions and many common mosses may still survive, un-noticed because of the decline of peat-cutting.

===Run rig===
{{Main article|Run rig}}
[[File:Buchansrigs.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ridge and furrow|
Rig and furrow marks]] at Buchans Field, [[National Museum of Rural Life|Wester Kittochside]], an area of Scottish common land]]
Run rig is a system of agriculture involving the cultivation of adjacent, narrow strips of raised land (rigs). Traditionally adjacent rigs would be used by different farmers and the rigs were periodically re-allocated between them. The system was common throughout Scotland until the 18th century, but survived longer in the Western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], where runrig was often associated with an adjacent area of common hill grazing which was also shared by the same farmers as the runrig.

===Scattalds===
Scattalds are unique to [[Shetland]] and are based on [[udal law]], rather than the [[feudal]] law that predominated in the rest of Scotland. However, Scattalds are very similar to commonties and many were divided under the same 1695 Act that allowed for the division of commonties.

===Crown Commons===
Crown Commons were areas of land held directly by the crown and therefore the common rights that could be used were rights of use rather than rights of property. Unlike commonties, the rights to use crown commons (for example for grazing livestock) were available to anyone, not just the neighbouring landowners. There are no crown commons left in Scotland; those that survived into the 20th century were taken over by the [[Crown Estate]].

===Greens and loans===
Greens were small areas of common land near a settlement where livestock could be kept overnight, markets held and other communal activities carried out. Sometimes they were adjacent to [[drovers' road]]s near river crossing points or overnight accommodation. Most were genuinely common land with only the Crown holding any title to them. A loan was a common route through private property allowing access to an area of common land or other public place. As the traditional uses of greens and loans declined, they were often absorbed by the neighbouring landowners.

===Burgh commons===
Burgh commons were areas of common land where property rights or privileges of use were held by the [[burgh]] for their inhabitants. They could include any of the other six types of common land and were sometimes shared with landowners outside the burgh. By the early 19th century, most burgh commons had been appropriated by the wealthy landowners who dominated burgh councils, and very few have survived.

==United States==
{{see also|Open range|Range war|Sheep Wars}}
Common land, an English development, was used in many former British colonies, for example in Ireland and the United States. The North American colonies adopted the English laws in establishing their own commons. Famous examples include the [[Boston Common]] in Massachusetts and the [[New Haven Green]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], some of the oldest commons in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/places/new-haven-green.htm|title=New Haven Green (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concordia Univesity Texas Entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance]]
'''Concordia University Texas''' is a [[Private university|private]], [[coeducational]] institution of [[liberal arts]] and [[sciences]] located in northwest [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. The university offers [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]] and online degrees as well as an Adult Degree Program for part-time and returning students.

Concordia University Texas is affiliated with the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and is a member of the [[Concordia University System]], the nine-member association of LCMS colleges and universities. As a Lutheran university, Concordia's stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/univservices/report/section%203.pdf|url=http://www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/univservices/report/section%203.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527133142/http://www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/Univservices/Report/Section%203.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-27|publisher=Concordia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; mission is to develop [[Christian]] leaders.

==History==
[[File:Kilianhall.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Historic Kilian Hall]]
Concordia was founded in 1926 as '''Lutheran Concordia College of Texas''', a four-year [[high school]] that prepared young men for careers in ministry and teaching. The school opened with 26 students on its original site along East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]]) on the then northern outskirts of Austin, Texas. In 1929, a two-story classroom building, later called the Music Building, and still later known as College Central, was built.

Concordia was founded by members of [[Wends of Texas|Texas's Wendish]] immigrant community. The original main building, Kilian Hall, is named for the Wend [[John Kilian]], founder of the first Texas Lutheran church associated with the LCMS and leader of a large group of [[Sorbs|Wends]] (also called Sorbs) who settled in the [[Serbin, Texas|Serbin]] area. Today, between 10 and 15 percent of Concordia's faculty, staff and students are of Wendish heritage.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s many buildings were added to the campus, such as Hirschi Memorial Library in 1949 and Kramer Hall, the college's first fully air-conditioned classroom building, in 1950, but dedicated on February 25, 1951. Also in 1951, Concordia started using a two-year [[junior college]] curriculum.

[[File:Concordiaoldfacultypic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old photograph of Concordia faculty in front of Kilian Hall]]
Building developments on campus continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The campus built its chapel, named Birkmann Memorial Chapel, in 1952. Texas Hall, which housed dining services and faculty offices was dedicated in 1953. Studtmann Hall, an all-girl's dormitory opened in 1955. The first Beto Hall on the Concordia campus was built in 1969 and housed science labs. In the early 21st century, this building was converted into the school's mail services facility.

In 1955 Concordia admitted women as students for the first time and the institution changed its name to '''Concordia Lutheran College''' in 1965. In 1969, the four-year high school program was disbanded and Concordia’s curriculum expanded to four years after receiving permission to award Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1980.

Concordia joined the [[Concordia University System]] (CUS) in 1993. The CUS represents the ten colleges and universities run by the LCMS. In 1995, under the leadership of President Rev. Dr. David Zersen, the name of the institution was changed to '''Concordia University at Austin'''. The Accelerated Degree Program (ADP), with sites in Austin, [[Ft. Worth]], [[Houston]], and [[San Antonio]], within the College of Adult Education, was launched in 1995 to offer working adults the opportunity to earn a degree. Harms Hall, a dormitory, opened in January 2000 more than doubling campus resident capacity.The first Graduate program was developed during this period.

In 2002, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, a former fighter pilot and Colonel in the United States Air Force was named President of the university.

In 2007, Concordia University at Austin changed its name to '''Concordia University Texas'''.

In August 2008, Concordia University relocated its primary campus, moving onto more than {{convert|389|acre|ha}} in Northwest Austin. The city of Austin allowed the demolition of the former campus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/agenda/2007/hlc_032607.htm Historic Landmark Commission Regular Meeting March 26, 2007 - 7:00 PM]." ''City of Austin''. Accessed September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A developer bought the space with plans to construct a mixed-use development; however, the developer filed for bankruptcy in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvue.com/news/local/stories/042508kvueConcordia2-cb.9c7a4fb2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427155030/http://www.kvue.com/news/local/stories/042508kvueConcordia2-cb.9c7a4fb2.html |archivedate=2008-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:449487|title=Developing Stories|author=|date=|website=austinchronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new campus was dedicated on October 26, 2008.

==New campus==
In 2005, the Board of Regents approved the relocation of the Concordia University Texas campus. Since its founding the school had occupied a {{convert|23|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus near downtown Austin. The new campus is located in northwest Austin on {{convert|384|acre|ha}} of land. Construction began in the spring of 2007, and the new campus opened in September 2008.

The site for Concordia's new campus is the former [[Schlumberger]] Austin Systems Center. The site, formerly an R&amp;D facility, had six buildings connected by covered walkways and encircled by a nature trail. The six buildings, named by letter A-F, while extensively renovated, retained their basic design and features, including solid oak trim, large windows, sky lights and atria.

Three new structures were built prior to occupation of the new Concordia campus: student housing, a fieldhouse and a front entry/guard house. In addition to the new structures, 600 additional parking spaces and new roads were built to handle the increased traffic on the campus. In 2014, Concordia broke ground on a state-of-the-art softball field that was completed in 2016.

The campus includes a {{convert|250|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[nature preserve]] that has springs and wetlands, caves, dense trees and wildlife. A 10-A federal permit is required and only one other higher education institution carries one. The inclusion of the nature preserve allows Concordia to devote time to urban [[environmentalism]] in the Austin community. The Concordia University Nature Preserve is part of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, a system of preserves in western [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] that provides habitat for a number of rare and endangered plant and animal species such the [[Golden-cheeked warbler]] and [[Black-capped vireo]], two rare species of [[songbird]]s that breed in [[Central Texas]].

In 2013, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, announced his retirement from Concordia University Texas. In 2014 Former Dean of the College of Business, Dr. Don Christian was named Chief Executive Officer.

==Student body==
'''Student Body, Fall 2017'''
*Total Enrollment: 2619
*Undergraduate: 1722
*Graduate: 897

==Academics==
Concordia University Texas has majors, minors, and programs of study within four colleges: Business &amp; Communication, Nursing (accredited by the Texas Nursing Board and [[Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education|CCNE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://absn.concordia.edu/about-concordia-texas/accreditations/|title=Concordia University Texas Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing|last=|first=|date=|website=Accelerated BSN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Education, and Arts &amp; Sciences. Concordia is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacscoc.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318185250/http://www.sacscoc.org/ |archivedate=2008-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus life==
Some of the many clubs and organizations that students participate in are: Concordia University Texas Collegiate [[DECA (organization)|DECA]], Concordia Outdoor Ministry, Service-Learning, Missions Club, Communication Club, Student Government &amp; Leadership Association (SGLA), Concordia Youth Ministry Team (CYMT), [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]], Helping Hands, History Club, Preseminarians of CTX, Society for Human Resource Management, Psychology Book Club, Kinesiology Club, Financial Management Association, Education Club, Directors of Christian Education Club, Biology Club, Behavioral Sciences Club, Association of Computing Machinery, Academic Advising Consultants, Model Organization of American States (MOAS), Moot Court, and the Spirit Squad. The school newspaper, ''The Mullet'', was first published in 2006, and in 2013 was renamed ''The Spin''. ''The Spin'' is published once a month during the semester.

==Athletics==
The Concordia mascot is the '''Tornados''' and the school colors are purple and gold. Concordia's intercollegiate athletic teams participate in [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] competition within the [[American Southwest Conference]]. They do not award athletic scholarships per Division III rules. The athletic programs at Concordia are: baseball, softball, men's basketball, women's basketball, cross country, golf, [[Concordia Tornados men's soccer|men's soccer]], [[Concordia Tornados women's soccer|women's soccer]], track and field, volleyball, tennis and athletic training.

In spring 2011, "Purple Out" events were started to encourage students, staff, and the community to support athletics. On designated "Purple Out" days, everyone is encouraged to wear purple and those attending a sporting event receive purple "Tornado Towels".

In 2011-2012, Concordia Texas experienced its most successful year athletically. This was accomplished by winning ASC Championships in Women's Cross Country, Women's Basketball, and Men's Baseball (second consecutive championship).

There were four athletic facilities on the old campus and one off-campus. On Campus: Fascholz-Keller Field (baseball), Bartholomew Park (softball), Pharr Tennis Center, Woltman Gymnasium. Off-campus: St. Francis School (soccer). Currently, men's and women's soccer play at St. Stephen's Episcopal School. Recently, the Concordia University soccer teams have been seen playing at Monroe Stadium at nearby Vandegrift High school.

=== Basketball ===
In the 2011-2012 season, the Concordia University Texas' women's basketball team won the American Southwest Conference.

The Concordia Men's basketball team has been coached by Stanley Bonewitz Jr. since 2004. He is a former [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech basketball]] standout. As a player, he was named Texas "Mr. Basketball" in 1995&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=46 |title=Concordia University Coaching Staff - Basketball |work=CTX.edu |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812204627/http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=46 |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Stanley Bonewitz Sr., recently retired as a state-championship winning coach at East Central High School in San Antonio.

=== Baseball ===
The Concordia Men's baseball team is coached by former major leaguer Tommy Boggs. Coach Boggs led the team to victory in 2011 as the ASC Conference Champions, and later to the NCAA championship tournament where they fell two games short of advancing to the College World Series. In 2012, the team recorded its best record ever and swept the ASC conference tournament to win the Conference title outright for a second consecutive year. Prior to Boggs' tenure, Mike Gardner was head coach since 1998. He retired at the end of the 2009 season as the winningest coach in school baseball history and led the team to its only appearance in the College World Series in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2002_Division_III_College_World_Series|title=2002 Division III College World Series - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mike"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=44 |title=Concordia University Coaching Staff - Baseball |work=CTX.edu |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812204831/http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=44 |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornado field debuted on the new campus in February 2011 and was dedicated in April 2011. It is home to Tornado Baseball.

=== Other sports ===
Chris Randle became the first student athlete from Concordia to qualify for the NCAA track and field championship tournament. His {{convert|6|ft|7|in|cm|adj=on}} high jump earned him a sixth-place finish in the tournament. Randle's participation marked the first time in school history that Concordia was represented at the NCAA Division III Championships in two sports during the same academic year, as the baseball team won the ASC title and won two games over nationally ranked opponents – Linfield and Redlands – at the West Regional.

In 2009 Concordia inducted its first ever Hall of Fame class, including the 2002 baseball team that played for the NCAA Division III College World Series and Atlanta Braves reliever [[Scott Linebrink]].

In 2011, three more members were inducted: Kenneth DeBord '02, basketball; Lisa Hintz '88, volleyball &amp; basketball and Linda Lowery, who served stints as the Athletic Director, volleyball coach and men's and women's golf coach from 1980-2008.

==Alumni==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3298">A '''cooling flow''' occurs according to the theory that the [[intracluster medium]] (ICM) in the centres of [[galaxy clusters]] should be rapidly cooling at the rate of tens to thousands of solar masses per year.&lt;ref&gt;Fabian A.C.: [http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Fabian3/frames.html Cooling flows in clusters of galaxies], Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 1994. 32: 277-318&lt;/ref&gt; This should happen as the ICM (a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) is quickly losing its energy by the emission of [[X-rays]]. The X-ray brightness of the ICM is proportional to the square of its density, which rises steeply towards the centres of many clusters. Also the temperature falls to typically a third or a half of the temperature in the outskirts of the cluster. The typical [predicted] timescale for the ICM to cool is relatively short, less than a billion years. As material in the centre of the cluster ''cools out'', the pressure of the overlying ICM should cause more material to flow inwards (the cooling flow).

In a steady state, the rate of ''mass deposition'', i.e. the rate at which the plasma cools, is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{M} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{L \mu m}{kT},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is the bolometric (i.e. over the entire spectrum) [[luminosity]] of the cooling region, ''T'' is its temperature, ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''μm'' is the mean molecular mass.

==Cooling flow problem==
It is currently thought that the very large amounts of expected cooling are in reality much smaller, as there is little evidence for cool X-ray emitting gas in many of these systems.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson J.R., et al.: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...590..207P High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopic Constrains on Cooling Flow Models for Clusters of Galaxies]. ApJ 2003. 590: 207&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ''cooling flow problem''. Theories for why there is little evidence of cooling include&lt;ref&gt;Peterson J.R., Fabian A.C.: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006PhR...427....1P X-ray spectroscopy of cooling clusters], Physics Reports. 2006. 427: 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heating by the central [[Active galactic nucleus]] (AGN) in clusters, possibly via [[sound waves]] (seen in the [[Perseus Cluster|Perseus]] and [[Virgo cluster]]s)
* [[Thermal conduction]] of heat from the outer parts of clusters
* [[Cosmic ray]] heating
* Hiding cool gas by absorbing material
* Mixing of cool gas with hotter material
Heating by AGN is the most popular explanation, as they emit a lot of energy over their lifetimes, and some of the alternatives listed have theoretical problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">A '''corporate university''' is any educational entity that is a strategic tool designed to assist its parent organization in achieving its goals by conducting activities that foster individual and organizational learning and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Mark|title=The Corporate University Handbook|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|date=2002|pages=9|isbn=978-0-8144-0711-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate universities (CU) are a growing trend in [[corporation]]s. In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]], [[Boeing]], and [[Motorola]].&lt;ref name="Hearn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/OrgTheory/Hearn721.html|title=Education in the Workplace: An Examination of Corporate University Models |last=Hearn|first=Denise R.|date=2002-05-10|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'corporate university' also refers to public universities which have developed, or have been forced by states to develop, corporate style behaviour&lt;ref&gt; Marginson and Considine, 2000, https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-University-Governance-Reinvention-Australia/dp/052179448X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528155796&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=simon+marginson&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In most cases, corporate universities are not [[University|universities]] in the strict sense of the word. The traditional university is an educational institution which grants both [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] degrees in a variety of subjects, as well as conducting original scientific research. In contrast, a corporate university typically limits scope to providing job-specific, indeed company-specific, training for the managerial personnel of the parent corporation. Corporate universities are most commonly found in the [[United States]], a nation which has no official legal definition of the term "university". Perhaps the best known corporate university is the [[Hamburger University]] operated by [[McDonald's Corporation]] in [[Chicago]].

==Typical goals of a corporate university==
Corporate universities are set up for a variety of reasons, but most organizations have the same basic needs. These are to:&lt;ref name="Hearn"/&gt;
*Bring a common culture, loyalty, and belonging to a company
*Get the most out of the investment in education
*Organize training
*Remain competitive in today's economy
*Retain employees 
*Start and support change in the organization

CUs offer valuable training and education to employees, but they also help organizations retain and promote key employees. Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project.

==Curriculum==
[[J.P. Morgan]] and Co. is an example of a company with an organized curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2003/07/28/focus2.html?page=1|title=Corporate university approach taking hold|last=Tanner|first=Lisa|date=2003-07-25|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three different types of courses: Business specific courses, organizational learning and communication classes, and management and executive training. What your company decides to offer will depend on your needs (such as sales training, marketing, or soft skills) and your company's business (like manufacturing, consulting, or technology). 

Most CUs offer a blended curriculum of online and in person classes. Some organizations offer courses during the workday while other offer them at varying times. Courses can be short workshops or longer, more traditional courses. 

Unlike traditional universities, CUs demand a return on their investment. There must be concrete evidence that the classroom is delivering results. Many CUs provide hands-on and team learning as a more effective alternative to lecture-based courses, but all CUs agree that what is learned in the classroom should be directly applicable to the work environment.

==Implementation==
Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project such as complex logistics, resource optimization and careful budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/training-roi-walmart-success-stéphane-pineau/|title=Training ROI- the Walmart success|last=Pineau|first=Stephane|date=2016-12-07|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, corporate universities tend to be cost centers with dedicated training facilities servicing an often global workforce through a dedicated curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21651217-more-firms-have-set-up-their-own-corporate-universities-they-have-become-less-willing-pay|title=Keeping it on the company campus|date=2015-05-15|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To manage this complexity, specific [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems have been developed for Corporate Universities, such as a [[Training management system]]. Other systems such as accounting systems and different types of [[Educational Technology| learning technologies]] can be used together.

'''Cortactin''' (from "''&lt;u&gt;cort&lt;/u&gt;ical &lt;u&gt;actin&lt;/u&gt;'' binding protein") is a monomeric [[protein]] located in the [[cytoplasm]] of cells that can be activated by external stimuli to promote [[polymerization]] and rearrangement of the [[actin]] [[cytoskeleton]], especially the actin cortex around the cellular periphery.&lt;ref name="pmid16990456"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosen-Binker LI, Kapus A | title = Cortactin: the gray eminence of the cytoskeleton | journal = Physiology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 352–61 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16990456 | doi = 10.1152/physiol.00012.2006 | url =  | issn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18615630"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ammer AG, Weed SA | title = Cortactin branches out: roles in regulating protrusive actin dynamics | journal = [[Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton]] | volume = 65 | issue = 9 | pages = 687–707 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18615630 | pmc = 2561250 | doi = 10.1002/cm.20296 | url =  | issn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is present in all cell types. When activated, it will recruit [[Arp2/3 complex]] proteins to existing actin microfilaments, facilitating and stabilizing [[nucleation]] sites for actin branching. Cortactin is important in promoting [[lamellipodia]] formation, [[invadopodia]] formation, [[cell migration]], and [[endocytosis]].

== Gene ==
In humans, cortactin is encoded by the ''CTTN'' [[gene]] on chromosome 11.&lt;ref name="pmid7685625"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brookes S, Lammie GA, Schuuring E, de Boer C, Michalides R, Dickson C, Peters G | title = Amplified region of chromosome band 11q13 in breast and squamous cell carcinomas encompasses three CpG islands telomeric of FGF3, including the expressed gene EMS1 | journal = Genes Chromosomes Cancer | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–31 | date = April 1993 | pmid = 7685625 | doi = 10.1002/gcc.2870060406 | url =  | issn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

Cortactin is a thin, elongated [[monomer]] that consists of an amino-terminal acidic (NTA) region; 37-residue-long segments that are highly conserved among cortactin proteins of all species and repeated up to 6.5 times in tandem (“cortactin repeats”); a proline-rich region; and an [[SH3 domain]]. This basic structure is highly conserved among all species that express cortactin.&lt;ref name="Daly_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daly RJ | title = Cortactin signalling and dynamic actin networks | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 382 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 13–25 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15186216 | pmc = 1133910 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20040737 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activation and binding ==

Cortactin is activated via [[phosphorylation]], by [[tyrosine kinases]] or [[serine/threonine kinases]], in response to extracellular signals like [[growth factors]], [[focal adhesion|adhesion sites]], or [[pathogenic]] invasion of the [[epithelial layer]].

The [[SH3 domain]] of certain tyrosine kinases, such as the oncogene [[Src (gene)|Src]] kinase, binds to cortactin’s proline-rich region and phosphorylates it on Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482. Once activated in this way, it can bind to [[Microfilament|filamentous]] actin ([[F-actin]]) with the fourth of its cortactin repeats.&lt;ref name="Daly_2004"/&gt; As the concentration of phosphorylated cortactin increases in specific regions within the cell, the monomers each begin to recruit an Arp2/3 complex to F-actin. It binds to Arp2/3 with an aspartic acid-aspartic acid-tryptophan (DDW) sequence in its NTA region, a motif that is often seen in other actin [[nucleation-promoting factors]] (NPFs).&lt;ref name="Weed_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weed SA, Karginov AV, Schafer DA, Weaver AM, Kinley AW, Cooper JA, Parsons JT | title = Cortactin localization to sites of actin assembly in lamellipodia requires interactions with F-actin and the Arp2/3 complex | journal = J. Cell Biol. | volume = 151 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–40 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11018051 | pmc = 2189811 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.151.1.29 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain serine/threonine kinases, such as [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]], can phosphorylate cortactin on Ser405 and Ser418 in the SH3 domain.&lt;ref name="Daly_2004"/&gt; Activated like this, it still associates with Arp2/3 and F-actin, but will also allow other actin NPFs, most importantly N-WASp (Neuronal [[Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein]]), to bind to the complex as well; when phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases, other NPFs are excluded.&lt;ref name="Martinez-Quiles_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez-Quiles N, Ho HY, Kirschner MW, Ramesh N, Geha RS | title = Erk/Src phosphorylation of cortactin acts as a switch on-switch off mechanism that controls its ability to activate N-WASP | journal = Mol. Cell. Biol. | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 5269–80 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15169891 | pmc = 419870 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.24.12.5269-5280.2004 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of these other NPFs to bind the Arp2/3 complex while cortactin is also bound could come from new interactions with cortactin’s SH3 domain, which is in a different conformation when phosphorylated by Ser/Thr kinases and thus may be more open to interactions with other NPFs.&lt;ref name="Martinez-Quiles_2004"/&gt; Having other NPFs bind to the Arp2/3 complex at the same time as cortactin may enhance nucleation site stability.&lt;ref name="Daly_2004"/&gt;

== Location and function in the cell ==

Inactive cortactin diffuses throughout the cytoplasm, but upon phosphorylation, the protein begins to target certain areas in the cell. Cortactin-assisted Arp2/3-nucleated actin branches are most prominent in the actin cortex, around the periphery of the cell.&lt;ref name="Weaver_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weaver AM, Karginov AV, Kinley AW, Weed SA, Li Y, Parsons JT, Cooper JA | title = Cortactin promotes and stabilizes Arp2/3-induced actin filament network formation | journal = Curr. Biol. | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 370–4 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11267876 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00098-7 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A phosphorylated cortactin monomer binds to, activates, and stabilizes an Arp2/3 complex on preexisting F-actin, which provides a nucleation site for a new actin branch to form from the “mother” filament. Branches formed from cortactin-assisted nucleation sites are very stable; cortactin has been shown to inhibit debranching.&lt;ref name="Weaver_2001" /&gt; Thus, polymerization and branching of actin is promoted in areas of the cell where cortactin is localized.

Cortactin is very active in lamellipodia, protrusions of the cell membrane formed by actin polymerization and [[treadmilling]] that propel the cell along a surface as it migrates towards some target.&lt;ref name="Weed_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weed SA, Parsons JT | title = Cortactin: coupling membrane dynamics to cortical actin assembly | journal = Oncogene | volume = 20 | issue = 44 | pages = 6418–34 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11607842 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1204783 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortactin acts as a link between extracellular signals and lamellipodial “steering.” When a [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] on the [[cell membrane]] binds to an adhesion site, for example, cortactin will be phosphorylated locally to the area of binding, activate and recruit Arp2/3 to the actin cortex in that region, and thus stimulate cortical actin polymerization and movement of the cell in that direction. [[Macrophages]], highly motile immune cells that engulf cellular debris and [[pathogens]], are propelled by lamellipodia and identify/migrate toward a target via [[chemotaxis]]; thus, cortactin must also be activated by receptor kinases that pick up a large variety of chemical signals.&lt;ref name="Weed_2001"/&gt;

Studies have implicated cortactin in both [[clathrin]]-mediated endocytosis&lt;ref name="Samaj_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Samaj J, Baluska F, Voigt B, Schlicht M, Volkmann D, Menzel D | title = Endocytosis, actin cytoskeleton, and signaling | journal = Plant Physiol. | volume = 135 | issue = 3 | pages = 1150–61 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15266049 | pmc = 519036 | doi = 10.1104/pp.104.040683 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and clathrin-independent endocytosis.&lt;ref name="Sauvonnet_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sauvonnet N, Dujeancourt A, Dautry-Varsat A | title = Cortactin and dynamin are required for the clathrin-independent endocytosis of gammac cytokine receptor | journal = J.

Recently, however, it has been found that [[dynamin]], the protein responsible for breaking the newly formed vesicular bud off the inside of the [[plasma membrane]], can associate with the SH3 domain of cortactin. Since cortactin recruits the Arp2/3 complexes that lead to actin polymerization, this suggests that it may play an important part in linking vesicle formation to the as yet unknown functions actin has in endocytosis.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu J, Zhou K, Hao JJ, Liu J, Smith N, Zhan X | title = Regulation of cortactin/dynamin interaction by actin polymerization during the fission of clathrin-coated pits | journal = J.

== Clinical significance ==

Amplification of the genes encoding cortactin—in humans, EMS1—has been found to occur in certain [[tumors]]. Overexpression of cortactin can lead to highly-active lamellipodia in tumor cells, dubbed “invadopodia.” These cells are especially [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]] and migratory, making them very dangerous, for they can easily spread cancer across the body into other tissues.&lt;ref name="Weaver_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weaver AM | title = Invadopodia: specialized cell structures for cancer invasion | journal = Clin.

'''Dramatic monologue''', also known as a [[persona]] poem, is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. [[M.H. Abrams]] notes the following three features of the ''dramatic monologue'' as it applies to poetry:
{{Quotation|
# A single person, who is patently ''not'' the poet, utters the speech that makes up the whole of the poem, in a specific situation at a critical moment […].
# This person addresses and interacts with one or more other people; but we know of the auditors' presence, and what they say and do, only from clues in the discourse of the single speaker.
# The main principle controlling the poet's choice and formulation of what the lyric speaker says is to reveal to the reader, in a way that enhances its interest, the speaker's temperament and character.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, gen. ed. "Dramatic Monologue." ''A Glossary of Literary Terms.'' 8th ed. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2005. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Types of dramatic  monologue==

One of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue  is [[romantic poetry]]. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]'', to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting.  The [[conversation poems]] of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], beginning in the latter's case with her long poem ''The Improvisatrice''.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Baiesi. ''Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Metrical Romance'', 2009, p.56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character's feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', and to implicate the audience in moral judgments, as in [[Albert Camus]] ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and [[Mohsin Hamid]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]''.

== Examples ==

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.

*[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', published in 1842, has been called the first true dramatic monologue. After ''Ulysses'', Tennyson's most famous efforts in this vein are ''Tithonus'', ''The Lotos-Eaters,'' and ''St. Simon Stylites,'' all from the 1842 ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]''; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.
*[[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Dover Beach]]'' and ''Stanzas from the Grand Chartreuse'' are famous, semi-autobiographical monologues. The former, usually regarded as the supreme expression of the growing [[scepticism (philosophy)|scepticism]] of the mid-Victorian period, was published along with the latter in 1867's ''New Poems.''
*[[Robert Browning]] produced his most famous work in this form. While ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is the most famous of his monologues, the form dominated his writing career. ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Caliban upon Setebos]]'', ''[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]'' and ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', as well as the other poems in ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' are just a handful of Browning's monologues.

Other Victorian poets also used the form.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote several, including ''Jenny'' and ''The Blessed Damozel''; [[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a number, including ''The Convent Threshold.'' [[Augusta Webster]]'s ''A Castaway,'' ''Circe'', and ''The Happiest Girl In The World'', [[Amy Levy]]'s ''Xantippe'' and ''A Minor Poet,'' and [[Felicia Hemans]]'s ''Arabella Stuart'' and ''Properzia Rossi'' are all exemplars of this technique. [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Hymn to Proserpine]]'' has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning's work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre- famous examples include [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Raven]] and [[Sylvia Plath]]'s [[Daddy (poem)|Daddy]].

Post-Victorian examples include [[William Butler Yeats]]'s ''The Gift of Harun al-Rashid'', [[Elizabeth Bishop]]'s ''Crusoe in England'', and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' and ''[[Gerontion]]''.

'''Earth Rangers''' is a Canadian environmental education and conservation non-profit aimed specifically at youth. The goal of the organization is to educate children and their families about [[biodiversity]], inspire them to adopt sustainable behaviours, and empower them to become directly involved in protecting animals and their habitats. Earth Rangers currently has more than 140,000 members across Canada, and visits 800 elementary schools every year with an educational live animal show.

==History==
Founded in 2004, Earth Rangers began as a local organization serving schools and community venues across the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. In 2011 the organization expanded across Canada, and since then has grown into a national organization of more than 40 staff and hundreds of volunteers.

== Membership ==
Earth Rangers is the largest conservation organization in Canada by membership, with more than 140,000 Earth Rangers Members in every province and territory.

Children can become an Earth Rangers Member by visiting the Earth Rangers website and registering for membership with parental permission. They are then sent a welcome package in the mail that includes their own personalized membership card, and gain access to online resources and environmentally-themed activities.

==Programs==

=== School Outreach ===
The Earth Rangers School Assembly is a presentation for Grades 1 to 6 that leverages the shared and innate connection children of all backgrounds have to animals. Through the power of live animal demonstrations, and positive, science-based information, the program educates students about the importance of protecting [[biodiversity]], while highlighting diverse [[Conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives across Canada. Throughout the show, students are introduced to four of the Earth Rangers Animal Ambassadors, such as Blue the [[Peregrine falcon|Peregrine Falcon]], Shelley the [[Painted turtle|Painted Turtle]], and Hudson the [[Eurasian lynx|Eurasian Lynx]]. The program visits more than 800 schools across Canada each year.

Earth Rangers also delivers hands-on, curriculum-linked Classroom Visits for Grades 3 to 6, which explore subjects like climate change, pollination, and wildlife habitats in more depth.

=== Bring Back the Wild ===
Each year, Earth Rangers works with conservation partners to identify Canadian species that are facing threats in the wild. The organization then develops tangible projects to protect those animals, ranging from conservation research, to land acquisition, to habitat stewardship. Earth Rangers Members are encouraged to select one of the animals and start a fundraising campaign to help them. Through the program, members learn about the full breadth and depth of conservation and are given the tools to make a meaningful contribution. Throughout the year, they are provided with updates on the project, ensuring that they know how their funds were used and what was accomplished with them and by them its was that they rescue animals.

=== Missions ===
Missions are fun, tangible activities Earth Rangers provides to members throughout the year that are designed to demonstrate the collective impact of working together to protect the environment. They address a wide range of issues and provide kids with ways to take action through things like conserving energy at home, organizing shoreline cleanups and planting pollinator gardens. Missions are also designed to be completed with the help of family and friends.The goal of this program is to educate and inspire children about biodiversity loss.

==Facility==
[[File:Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable Technology.jpg|335px|thumb|Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable Technology]]The Earth Rangers Centre is an advanced green building, certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum for Existing Buildings and Gold for New species.

The Earth Rangers Centre is located in [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]], [[Ontario]] on the grounds of the [[Kortright Centre|Kortright Centre for Conservation]]. It is home to Earth Rangers’ staff and Animal Ambassadors, and is a showcase of leading edge sustainable building technology including energy metering, smart automation and controls, innovative water and wastewater management, [[solar generation]], [[green roof]], [[geothermal heating]] and cooling.

=== Ventiliation ===
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first buildings in Canada to use [[displacement ventilation]], and has the largest installation of earth tubes in North America. This ventilation system circulates air through diffusers located near the floor level and displaces the existing air into return ducts near the ceiling.

=== Data Centre ===
The Earth Rangers 9.3 square metre [[data centre]] was completed in December 2008. The data room uses storage servers from Pillar, Dell’s processing [[Server (computing)|servers]], and virtual personal machines using [[VMware]] View software. Nortel’s [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE) switching facilitates the transfer of electrical power and data across the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/commercial/technical-info/newsletter.cfm?attr=20 Heads Up Energy Efficiency Newsletter - March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Earth Rangers also participates in Compugen’s Green4Good program which works to combat the environmental impact of end-of-life technology products and support charities in need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelbuzz.ca/2010/10/new-asset-reuse-program-couples-environmental-and-charitable-benefits-236/#more-236 New asset reuse program couples environmental and charitable benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar Electricity ===
The Earth Rangers Centre has two [[Photovoltaic|solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays]] in operation; both convert the sun’s rays into standard voltage to be used by the building’s systems. In the Earth Rangers Centre parking lot there is a 57.6&amp;nbsp;kWp dual-axis tracking array on six separate posts consisting of 54 Solgate 175&amp;nbsp;W panels, provided by Sentinel Power Systems. Each array follows the sun from east to west during the day, increasing output by up to 30 per cent over a fixed panel. Each panel has its own {{Not a typo|Enphase}} micro-inverter, further increasing the efficiency of the arrays and allowing real-time monitoring of the system on panel by panel basis. The second array is located on the aviary, a building that boasts a 28.08&amp;nbsp;kWp, designed and installed by Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviro-energytech.com/ Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; This offsets approximately 10% of the Earth Rangers Centre’s annual needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnyportal.com/Templates/PublicPageOverview.aspx?page=c9886868-f2c1-414d-adc6-ff66465e0935&amp;plant=d75990bd-510f-4560-9ebc-a3c5a35aaac9 Earth Rangers Aviary 28.08kW Earth Rangers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heating and Cooling ===
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first 100% radiant heated and cooled buildings in North America. The building uses 22&amp;nbsp;km of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/[[glycol]]) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, cooled liquid is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the cooled liquid in the tubing to warm up. The liquid is then cooled by rejecting heat to the ground source system or free cooled by directly coupling to the cooling tower. In the colder months, the [[glycol]] is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system.

==Animal ambassadors==
The Earth Rangers Centre houses over 40 animals that act as Animal Ambassadors for the organization, including ring-tailed lemurs, red foxes, bald eagles, African servals, and American kestrels.

'''Eco-restructuring''' is the implication for an ecologically sustainable [[economy]].  The principle of [[ecological modernization]] establishes the core literature of the functions that eco-restructuring has within a global regime. Eco-restructuring has an emphasis on the technological progressions within an ecological system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maricica|first=D. I.|year=2011|title=Ecological modernisation a basis for the tourism sustainable development|url=|journal=Annals of DAAAM &amp; Proceedings|volume=22 |issue=1|pages=1357–1358|via=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials implement environmental policies to establish the industrial- ecological progressions that enable the motion of economic modernization. When establishing economic growth, policy makers focus on the progression towards a sustainable environment by establishing a framework of ecological engineering. Government funding is necessary when investing in efficient technologies to stimulate technological development.

Environmental dimensions such as the preservation of landscape is achieved through [[sustainability]]. When analyzing the issues of sustainability, the importance of socio-technical transitions is highlighted to meet the needs of ecological policies. When an organization of resources is sustainable, it means that it will remain at a certain level of progress due to self-preservation without affecting the fundamental purpose of its existence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2009|title=Sustainable development and the need for technological revolution|journal=Annals of DAAAM &amp; Proceeding|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=1061–1062|via=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the industrial sector allows for sustainability to progress in an effective manner. When eco-restructuring is applied to the concept of sustainability, environmentally friendly technologies are essentially the main framework for clean and efficient productions.

Social support and acknowledgement must be present when highlighting the functions of modernizing the ecological structures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buttel|first=F. H.|year=2000|title=Ecological modernization as social theory|journal=Geoforum|volume=31 |issue=1|pages=57–65|via=10.1016/S0016-7185(99)00044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To have a smooth transition between socio-technical categories, social agreement is important when introducing eco-restructuring methods. When forming new ecological policies, policy makers focus on the movement that sustainable environments have in regards to the social expectations.

Economic [[Production (economics)|production]] is an example of the existing relationship between eco-restructuring and sustainability. Cleaner production with minimal impact on the environment is the main idea behind the correlation of the two subjects. Since [[industrial ecology]] contributes to the direction of sustainability, eco-restructuring is perceived as a benefit for the environment and natural adaptation. Critics of the eco-restructuring and sustainability policies argue that a clear balance between a self-preserving ecological system and mass production is difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=A.|year=1996|title=Ecotechnology in industrial practice: Implementation using sustainability indices and case studies|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=7 |issue=2|pages=117–138|via=10.1016/0925- 8574(96)00005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological engineering has been a major component used when applying eco-restructuring methods in the production of resources.

== Origins ==
In 1998, the book ''Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. The book provided a significant contribution to the research of industrial- ecological progressions. Robert Ayres introduced a new prototype of eco-restructuring for sustainable development of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadkarni|first=M. V.|year=2000|title=Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development|journal=Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=55|pages=62–63|via=http://search.proquest.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication for cleaner and more efficient technologies contributes to the research of ecological construction.

=== Technologies ===

Efficient technologies are defined as services that reduce the non-renewable resources produced and increase the production rate.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duchin|first=F.|last2=Lange|first2=G. M.|last3=Kell|first3=G.|year=1995|title=Technological change, trade and the environment|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=14|pages=185–193|via=doi:10.1016/0921-8009(95)00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] is a form of energy obtained from clean and natural resources. Solar and wind power technologies are examples of clean energy forms that would eliminate pollution produced from the coal and diesel energy sectors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Economic movement ===

The economic movement outlined by Robert Ayers refers to the use of [[Green economy|green economies]]. This type of economy structure looks at ways to reduce the environmental impacts. Nations focus on steering their policy agenda to allow the implementation of ecological strategies. This will accelerate the transformation of the economy sectors towards a clean and effective ecological state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social lifestyles ===

Human economic activities can influence the type of issues that ecological systems face. These social lifestyles are subject to the changes in the production of goods and services. An example of this idea would be the collection of raw materials and disposing them in a proper efficient manner that will have little impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the whole cycle is restructured to meet the principles of ecological regulation, then experts would have to analyze the effects of human activities and determine a possible alternative to the removal of [[biomedical waste]] and other raw materials.

Many of the eco-restructuring principles were outlined in the ''Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development'' book. However, policy makers can also have an opinion on the ideas and promises that this method of sustainability offers. Certain factors can influence the regulations that the policies cover such as the need for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Legislative measures are also developed based on the propositions of ecological and economical advantages. The principle of sustainable development applies to the restructuring of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles. These principles have helped to determine an evolution of the ecological system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Environmental factors ==
When an ecological system is altered, environmental standards must be put in place to preserve the stability of the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The application of eco-restructuring seeks to improve the environmental stability in relation to manufacturing and waste management. However, ecological effects can occur by following improper procedures. Despite the precautions that must be considered, there are environmental benefits of ecological modernization such as renewable energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of renewable energy would eliminate the threat of ecological dangers such as pollution. Modern technologies also have a role in the impact of the environment. When new technologies are developed, sustainability is achieved through improving the environmental dimensions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Eco-restructuring and sustainability ==
Socio-technical transitions correlate to the need for social change in the study of sustainable resources. Sustainability has a significant role in the fields of management such as education, health care, economics, ecology and technology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The main framework for clean and efficient productions is supported by the idea of a self-preserving system. Despite the research supporting the reformation of the ecological system, natural resources can suffer a depletion and will need the support of sustainability to preserve its existence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; New policies are required to move towards equality and sustainability since the social expectations reflect the relationship between the two concepts. The public perception for an alternative solution to sustainable development is reflected through the ecological policies enacted by government officials. Eco-restructuring offers a positive aspect to the principles of ecological modernization. It is an alternative to the motion of technological progressions within the global economic regime.

The '''Edison Engineering Development Program''' (EEDP) is one of [[General Electric]]'s 8 corporate entry level programs. Focused on engineering, the program aims to "develop technical problem-solving skills through advanced courses in engineering and technical projects that are aligned with business objectives". It is named in honor of GE's founder, [[Thomas Edison]].
Typically each GE business runs its own program, and candidates are required to apply for and rotate within the program at a specific business.

EEDP, the oldest of GE's rotational programs, founded in 1923, for new BS and MS grads, provides three to five assignments (6–8 months each (12 months in GE Aviation)) over two or three years. Assignments are driven by real GE business priorities, which may include working with systems, analysis, design, quality, reliability, integration, and testing. Program members develop and enhance their technical problem-solving skills through advanced engineering course work, reports, and team presentations. Another benefit of EEDP is the opportunity to earn a masters in engineering while in (or shortly upon completion of) the program.  EEDP is most popular at the more technical businesses in GE's portfolio, including GE Aviation, Healthcare, Power, Renewable Energy, Digital, Transportation.

==Program Summary==
* Two or three year entry-level program consisting of at least three rotation assignments
* Assignments are engineering projects and may include systems, hardware/software/mechanical design, quality, and validation
* First year coursework includes advanced engineering topics to develop technical skills
* Second year coursework includes corporate leadership topics to develop business skills
* Program members are encouraged (if not required) to earn credit towards an MS degree in Engineering while on program (normally done in the third year of the program)

==Candidate Criteria==
(from GE's official site)
* Passion for technology
* Demonstrated academic excellence
* Commitment to technology and quality
* Strong analytical, problem-solving and communication skills
* Engineering degree and relevant internship/co-op experience preferred
* Minimum GPA 3.0/4.0

==Advanced Courses in Engineering==

The Advanced Courses in Engineering, or ACE, is the official title for the graduate-level coursework undertaken by EEDP members. The ACE is divided into three sections: A Course, B Course, and C Course.  Grading is assessed based on homework and/or tests.  Homework may consist of problem sets, short reports or formal reports, team or individual presentations and typically requires 20–40 hours of effort per week, which must be completed outside of normal work hours.

During the first year in the program, EEDP participants are required to take GE's engineering "A Course," which is designed to sharpen technical and problem-solving skills.  The content of A Course varies by business, but typically includes a collection of topics rooted in technology, math, and science, such as [[Statistics]], [[Differential Equations]], [[Digital Electronics]], [[Analog Electronics]], Software Design, [[Data Mining]], [[Metallurgy]], and [[Heat Transfer]], as well as business-specific engineering, which may include engines, digital imaging, chemistry, and the physics of technologies used in that business' field. For instance, wind turbine design, wind resource assessment in GE Renewable Energy. Additionally, members participate in GE's esteemed "Activating your Leadership Journey (ALJ) (Formerly: Foundations of Leadership)" course on its [[Crotonville, New York]] campus and "Eng@GE" (Engineering @ GE) in various locations in the world. 

The second year in the program, participants are required to take the "B Course," which applies technical skills to actual business proposals.  Coursework typically involves technical business fundamentals, such as program management incorporated in team projects where a certain business priority problem is solved by a team of Edisons.  Additional classes cover extensive seminars on technology and a lot of hands-on training, either in the field or at the factories. Program members may choose a major business project to complete at the conclusion of the program, and then report out to senior management on the benefits generated (cost reductions, use of advanced technologies, etc.).

The third and final part of the ACE program is "C Course," which is a strictly optional course for some businesses.  The focus of C Course is a design project related to the enrollee's Masters thesis.  Few program members pursue a C Course certificate, but it is considered a top achievement throughout technical roles at GE.

After completion of the ACE program, EEDP engineers will have a number of graduate credits they can transfer to one of several universities (typically universities located near the business, or other top schools available via distance learning) to help complete a master's degree.  This allows program participants to earn a Masters or other advanced degree through a number of top schools while still employed by GE and working full-time.

ACE requirements vary from business to business. ACE programs at all GE businesses do not strictly adhere to the above definitions of the A, B, and C Courses.

==Rotations==
The members taking this course work in a minimum of 2 or 3 fields/teams over a period of 2 to 3 years. These rotations help in bridging the knowledge gap between teams and thus adding value to the organization.

==Leadership Trainings==
The participants undergo different levels of Management trainings such as "ALJ-Activating your Leadership Journey", eng@ge-engineering @ GE, as well as Six Sigma Green Belt Certification.

[[File:DHCOM Computer On Module - AM35x.jpg|thumb|right|An ''embedded system'' on a plug-in card with processor, memory, power supply, and external interfaces]]

An '''embedded system''' is a [[RTOS|programmed controlling and operating system]] with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with [[real-time computing]] constraints.&lt;ref name="Barr-glossary"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Barr|title=Embedded Systems Glossary|work=Neutrino Technical Library|accessdate=2007-04-21|url=http://www.netrino.com/Embedded-Systems/Glossary|authorlink=Michael Barr (software engineer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Steve |title=Embedded systems design|publisher=Newnes|year=2003|edition=2|series=EDN series for design engineers|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjNZXwH7HlkC&amp;pg=PA2|quote= An embedded system is a [[microprocessor]] based system that is built to control a function or a range of functions. | ISBN=978-0-7506-5546-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ''embedded'' as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Barr|author2=Anthony J. Massa|title=Programming embedded systems: with C and GNU development tools|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2006|pages=1–2|chapter=Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPZaPJrw_L0C&amp;pg=PA1 | ISBN=978-0-596-00983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-eight percent of all [[microprocessor]]s are manufactured components of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Real men program in C | last=Barr |first=Michael | page=2 | date=1 August 2009 | work=Embedded Systems Design | publisher=TechInsights (United Business Media) | url=http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/barr-code/4027479/Real-men-program-in-C | accessdate=2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.&lt;ref name="Alippi2014"&gt;C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]", IJCAET, 6(4), 440–459, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern embedded systems are often based on [[microcontroller]]s (i.e. CPUs with integrated memory or peripheral interfaces),&lt;ref name="micro controller"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill |last=Giovino|title=Micro controller.com – Embedded Systems supersite|url=http://www.microcontroller.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].

Embedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], to large stationary installations like [[traffic light]]s, [[Programmable logic controller|factory controllers]], and largely complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[MRI]], and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single [[microcontroller]] chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[chassis]] or enclosure.

==History==
One of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{cn|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed monolithic integrated circuits to reduce the size and weight. An early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.

Since these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]] for example , the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. In 1978 National Engineering Manufacturers Association released a "standard" for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.

As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[analog electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.

A comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.

==Applications==
[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Activism/E-voting/infosheets2006/AccuPollAVS1000.pdf Electronic Voting Machine Information Sheet Accupoll AVS 1000 ]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications.

Telecommunications systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[cell phone]]s at the end user.
Computer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.

[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].
Household appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.

Transportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.
New airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.
Various electric motors — [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s — use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.
[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.
Other automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].

[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections. Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/oem-industry-solutions-build-your-product-with-dell Embedded Systems Dell OEM Solutions | Dell]. Content.dell.com (2011-01-04). Retrieved on 2013-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embedded systems are used in transportation, fire safety, safety and security, medical applications and life critical systems, as these systems can be isolated from hacking and thus, be more reliable, unless connected to wired or wireless networks via on-chip 3G cellular or other methods for IoT monitoring and control purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For fire safety, the systems can be designed to have greater ability to handle higher temperatures and continue to operate. In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.

A new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charges.

Embedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.

==Characteristics==
Embedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.

Embedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com – Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design – Embedded.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.

[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 &amp; eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]
The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.

===User interface===
[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA&lt;ref group="nb" name="MicroVGA"&gt;For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Embedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.
Simple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].

More sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a "joystick button" for a pointing device.

Some systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I²C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.

===Processors in embedded systems===
Embedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (μP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (μC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.

[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.

====Ready-made computer boards====
[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.

In certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.

However, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI buses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.

One common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.

Implementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].

====ASIC and FPGA solutions====
A common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).

===Peripherals===
[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]

Embedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:
* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.
* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)
* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)
* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)
* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.
* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.
* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s
* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)
* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])
* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[In Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP)|ICSP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.

===Tools===
As with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:
* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).
* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.
* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.
* System level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that helps designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.
* A model-based development tool creates and simulate graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.
* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.
* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].
* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]
* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]

Software tools can come from several sources:
* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market
* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools
* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor

As the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical applications.
Some examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.

==Debugging==
Embedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).

From simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:
* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)
* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.
* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2070942.2070972|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288–301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. 
* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.
* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.
* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.
* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2737095.2737096|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286–297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.

Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).
An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.

===Tracing===

Real-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors. Commercial tools like [[RTXC Quadros]] or [[IAR Systems]] exists.

===Reliability===
Embedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.

Specific reliability issues may include:
* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.
* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. "Limp modes" are less tolerable. Often backups are selected by an operator. Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.
* The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.

A variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors—both software bugs such as [[memory leak]]s, and also [[soft error]]s in the hardware:
* [[watchdog timer]] that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software "limp modes" that provide partial function
* Designing with a [[Trusted Computing Base]] (TCB) architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://c59951.r51.cf2.rackcdn.com/5557-528-heiser.pdf |title=Your System is secure? Prove it! |first1=Gernot |last1=Heiser |date=December 2007 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=35–8 |journal=[[;login:]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensures a highly secure &amp; reliable system environment
* A [[hypervisor]] designed for embedded systems, is able to provide secure encapsulation for any subsystem component, so that a compromised software component cannot interfere with other subsystems, or privileged-level system software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moratelli|first1=C|last2=Johann|first2=S|last3=Neves|first3=M|last4=Hessel|first4=F|title=Embedded virtualization for the design of secure IoT applications|journal=2016 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)|date=2016|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.libproxy2.usc.edu/document/7909116/|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from one subsystem to another, improving reliability. This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.
* [[Immunity Aware Programming]]

===High vs. low volume===
For high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just “good enough” to implement the necessary functions.

For low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].

==Embedded software architectures==
{{Main article|Embedded software}}

There are several different types of software architecture in common use.

===Simple control loop===
In this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop [[subroutine|calls subroutines]], each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.

===Interrupt-controlled system===
Some embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.

These kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.

Sometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.

===Cooperative multitasking===
A [[nonpreemptive multitasking]] system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref name="Barr-glossary" /&gt; The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to “run” in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called “pause”, “wait”, “yield”, “nop” (stands for ''no operation''), etc.

The advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.

===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===
In this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an "operating system" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.

As any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.

Because of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, Wireless LAN, trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.

===Microkernels and exokernels===
A [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.

In general, microkernels succeed when the task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.

[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.

===Monolithic kernels===
In this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.

Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]] and [[Windows CE]].

Despite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:
* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.
* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.
* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.
* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].

===Additional software components===
In addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller–area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included. In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.

'''Expectancy violations theory''' ('''EVT''') is a theory of [[communication]] that analyzes how individuals respond to unanticipated violations of social [[Norm (social)|norms]] and expectations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K.|last2=Hale|first2=J.L.|title=Nonverbal Expectancy Violations: Model Elaboration and Application to Immediacy Behaviors|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1988|volume=55|pages=58–79|doi=10.1080/03637758809376158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed by [[Judee K. Burgoon]] in the late 1970s and continued through the 1980s and 1990s as "nonverbal expectancy violations theory", based on Burgoon's research studying [[proxemics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgoon 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgoon|first=Judee|title=Applying a comparative approach to nonverbal expectancy violations theory|year=1992|publisher=Sage|pages=53–69|url=}} In J. Blumler, K. E. Rosengren, &amp; J. M. McLeod (Eds.), Comparatively speaking: Communication and culture across space and time (pp. 53–69). Newbury Park, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Burgoon's work initially analyzed individuals' allowances and expectations of personal distance and how responses to personal distance violations were influenced by the level of liking and relationship to the violators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K.|last2=Jones|first2=S.B.|title=Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and their Violations|journal=Human Communication Research|date=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–146|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was later changed to its current name when other researchers began to focus on violations of social behavior expectations beyond nonverbal communication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Relational quality and relationships: An expectancy violations analysis|last = Guerrero|first = L.K.|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|doi = 10.1177/0265407506070476|pmid = |first2 = G.F.|last2 = Bachman |volume=23 |issue = 6|pages=943–963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory sees communication as an exchange of behaviors, where one individual's behavior can be used to violate the expectations of another. Participants in communication will perceive the exchange either positively or negatively, depending upon an existing personal relationship or how favorably the violation is perceived.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J.

Beyond proxemics and examining how people interpret violations in many given communicative contexts, EVT also makes specific predictions about individuals' reaction to given expectation violations: individuals reciprocate or match someone's unexpected behavior, and they also compensate or counteract by doing the opposite of the communicator's behavior.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Mark|last2=Stukas|first2=Arthur A.|year=1999|title=Interpersonal Processes: The Interplay of Cognitive, Motivational, and Behavioral Activities in Social Interaction|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|pages=273–303|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.273|pmid=10074680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
The expectancy violations theory examines three main components in interpersonal communication situations:  Expectancies, communicator reward valence, and violation valence.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|last1=Griffin|first1=Em|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0073534305|edition=8|location=|pages=84–92|chapter=Chapter 7: Expectancy Violations Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expectancy ===

Expectancy refers to what an individual anticipates will happen in a given situation. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] of the communicators.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=M. B.|last2=Yuhua|first2=J. L.|year=2007|title=Students' Reactions to Teachers' Management of Compulsive Communicators|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=56|issue=|pages=18–33|doi=10.1080/03634520601016178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoon (1978) notes that people do not view others' behaviors as random. Rather, they have various expectations of how others should think and behave. EVT proposes that observation and interaction with others leads to expectancies. The two types of expectancies noted are predictive and prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Houser"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are We Violating Their Expectations? Instructor Communication Expectations of Traditional and Nontraditional Students|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=2005|volume=53|issue=2|pages=217–218|doi=10.1080/01463370500090332|url=|author=M. L. Houser|location=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive expectations are "behaviors we expect to see because they are the most typical," (Houser, 2005) and vary across cultures.&lt;ref name="Houser" /&gt; They let people know what to expect based upon what typically occurs within the context of a particular environment and relationship.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; For example, a husband and wife may have an evening routine in which the husband always washes the dishes. If he were to ignore the dirty dishes one night, this might be seen as a predictive discrepancy. Prescriptive expectations, on the other hand, are based upon "beliefs about what behaviors should be performed" and "what is needed and desired" (Houser, 2005).&lt;ref name="Houser" /&gt; If a person walks into a police department to report a crime, the person will have an expectation that the police will file a report and follow up with an investigation.

When the theory was first proposed, EVT identified three factors which influence a person's expectations:  Interactant variables, environmental variables, and variables related to the nature of the interaction.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K.|author2=S. B. Jones|title=Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and Their Violations|journal=Human Communication Research|year=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–146|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactant variables are the traits of those persons involved in the communication, such as sex, attractiveness, race, culture, status, and age.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nonverbal Expectancies and the Evaluative Consequences of Violations|url = |journal = Human Communication Research|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 1468-2958|pages = 232–265|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1990.tb00232.x|first = Judee K.|last = Burgoon|first2 = Joseph B.|last2 = Walther}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental variables include the amount of space available and the nature of the territory surrounding the interaction.  Interaction variables include [[social norms]], purpose of the interaction, and formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976" /&gt;

These factors later evolved into communicator characteristics, relational characteristics, and context.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  Communicator characteristics include personal features such as an individual's appearance, personality and communication style.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; It also includes factors such as age, sex and ethnic background.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4129-7737-1|page=91|author=L. K. Guerrero|edition=3rd |author2=P. A. Anderson |author3=V. A. Afifi|chapter=Making Sense of Our World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational characteristics refer to factors such as similarity, familiarity, status and liking.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; The type of relationship one individual shares within another (e.g. romantic, business or platonic), the previous experiences shared between the individuals, and how close they are with one another are also relational characteristics that influence expectations.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson" /&gt; Context encompasses both environment and interaction characteristics.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson" /&gt;  Communicator characteristics lead to distinctions between males and females in assessing the extent to which their nonverbal expressions of power and dominance effect immediacy behaviors.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Silent Messages|last = Mehrabrian|first = A.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Belmont, CA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediacy cues such as conversational distance, lean, body orientation, gaze, and touch may differ between the genders as they create psychological closeness or distance between the interactants.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

[[Behavioural]] expectations may also shift depending on the environment one is experiencing. For example, a visit to a church will produce different expectations than a social function. The expected violations will therefore be altered. Similarly, expectations differ based on culture. In [[Europe]], one may expect to be greeted with three kisses on alternating cheeks, but this is not the case in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebenius|first=James K.|title=Assess, Don't Assume, Part I: Etiquette and National Culture in Negotiation|date=2009|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=37171}} Harvard Business School Working Paper, No. 10-048.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communicator reward valence  ===

The communicator reward valence is an evaluation one makes about the person who committed a violation of expectancy. Em Griffin summarizes the concept behind Communicator Reward Valence as "the sum of positive and negative attributes brought to the encounter plus the potential to reward or punish in the future".&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt;  The [[social exchange theory]] explains that individuals seek to reward some and seek to avoid punishing others.&lt;ref name="West &amp; Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=R. L.|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year=2007|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|isbn=9780073135618|page=188|edition=3rd|author2=L. H. Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one individual interacts with another, Burgoon believes he or she will assess the "positive and negative attributes that person brings to the encounter".&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  If the person has the ability to reward or punish the receiver in the future, then the person has a positive reward valence. Rewards simply refer to the person's ability to provide a want or need. The term 'communicator reward valence' is used to describe the results of this assessment.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  For example, people will feel encouraged during conversation when the listener is nodding, making eye contact, and responding actively. Conversely, if the listener is avoiding eye contact, yawning, and texting, it is implied they have no interest in the interaction and the speaker may feel violated.

When examining the context, relationship, and communicator's characteristics in a given encounter, individuals will arrive at an expectation for how that person should behave. Changing even one of these expectancy variables may lead to a different expectation.&lt;ref name=Dainton2010/&gt;

=== Violation valence ===

Behavior violations arouse and distract, calling attention to the qualities of the violator and the relationship between the interactants.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = W. A. | last2 = Metts | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Characteristics and Consequences of Expectation Violations in Close Relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 365–392 | doi=10.1177/0265407598153004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key component of EVT is the notion of violation [[Valence (psychology)|valence]], or the association the receiver places on the behavior violation.&lt;ref name="Houser, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houser | first1 = M. L. | year = 2005 | title = Are We Violating Their Expectations? Instructor Communication Expectations of Traditional and Non Traditional Students | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 213–228 | doi=10.1080/01463370500090332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A violatee's response to an expectancy violation can be positive or negative, and is dependent on two conditions:  positive or negative interpretation of the behavior and the nature (rewardingness) of the violator.  Rewardingness of the violator is evaluated through many categories – attractiveness, prestige, ability to provide resources, or associated relationship.  For instance, a violation of one's personal distance might have more positive valence if committed by a wealthy, powerful, physically appealing member of the opposite sex than a filthy, poor, homeless person with foul breath. The evaluation of the violation is based upon the relationship between the particular behavior and the valence of the actor.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998" /&gt;  A person's preinteractional expectancies, especially
personal attributes, may cause a perceiver to evaluate the communication behavior
of a target differently in terms of assigning positive and negative valenced expectancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00316.x|title = Effects of Communication Expectancies, Actual Communication, and Expectancy Disconfirmation on Evaluations of Communicators and Their Communication Behavior|journal = Human Communication Research|volume = 20|pages = 67|year = 1993|last1 = Burgoon|first1 = Judee K.|last2 = Le Poire|first2 = Beth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective of violation valence is that the perceived positive or negative value assigned to a breach of expectations is inconsequential of who the violator is.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt; This perspective places much greater weight on the act of the breach itself than the violator.  The difference between the negative violation and the negative confirmation do not appear significant. Dis-confirmations tend to intensify the outcomes, especially in the positive violation condition.&lt;ref name=Dainton2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dainton|first1=Marianne|last2=Zelley|first2=Elaine D.|title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life: A Practical Introduction|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1412976916|pages=48–49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arousal ===
Expectancy violations refer to actions which are noticeably discrepant from an expectancy and are classified as outside the range of expectancy. The term 'arousal value' is used to describe the consequences of deviations from expectations. When individuals' expectations are violated, their interests or attentions are aroused.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;

When [[arousal]] occurs, one's interest or attention to the deviation increases, resulting in less attention paid to the message and more attention to the source of the arousal.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le Poire|first1=Beth A.|last2=Burgoon|first2=Judee K.|year=1996|title=Usefulness of differentiating arousal responses within communication theories: Orienting response or defensive arousal within nonverbal theories of expectancy violation|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=63|issue=3|pages=208–230|doi=10.1080/03637759609376390}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of arousals. Cognitive arousal is an idea that people will be mentally aware of the violation. Physical occurs when people have body actions and behaviors in response to the deviations from their expectations.&lt;ref name="West &amp; Turner" /&gt;

=== Threat threshold ===
The occurrence of arousal is aligned with threats. Burgoon introduced the term "threat threshold" to explain that people have different levels of tolerance about distant violations. The threat threshold is high when people feel good even if they keep a very close distance with the violator, whereas people with low threat threshold will be sensitive and uncomfortable about the closeness of distance with the violator.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;

== Theoretical assumptions and viewpoints ==

=== Propositions ===
After assessing expectancy, violation valence, and communicator reward valence of a given situation, it becomes possible to make rather specific predictions about whether the individual who perceived the violation will reciprocate or compensate the behavior in question. Guerrero (1996) and Burgoon (2000) noticed that predictable patterns develop when considering reward valence and violation valence together.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L. K. | last2 = Burgoon | first2 = J. K. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment Styles and Reactions to Nonverbal Involvement Change in Romantic Dyads Patterns of Reciprocity and Compensation | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 335–370 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00371.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if the violation valence is perceived as positive and the communicator reward valence is also perceived as positive, the theory predicts individuals will reciprocate the positive behavior. For example, your boss gives you a big smile after you have given a presentation. Guerrero and Burgoon would predict that you would smile in return. Similarly, if you perceive the violation valence as negative and perceive the communicator reward valence as negative, the theory again predicts that you reciprocate the negative behavior. Thus, if a disliked coworker is grouchy and unpleasant towards you, you will likely reciprocate and be unpleasant in return.

Conversely, if one perceives a negative violation valence but views the communicator reward valence as positive, it is likely that the person will compensate for his or her partner's negative behavior. For example, one day your boss appears sullen and throws a stack of papers in front of you. Rather than grunt back, EVT predicts that you will compensate for your boss' negativity, perhaps by asking if everything is OK (Guerrero &amp; Burgoon, 1996). More difficult to predict, however, is the situation in which a person who is viewed unfavorably violates another with positive behavior. In this situation, the receiver may reciprocate, giving the person the "benefit of the doubt."&lt;ref name="Dainton2010" /&gt;

The assumptions discussed thus far can be summarized into six major propositions posited by Expectancy Violations Theory:&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Burgoon, J. K., Stern L. A., &amp; Dillman, L. (1995). Interpersonal adaptation. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# People develop expectations about verbal and nonverbal [[communication]] behavior from other people.
# Violations of these expectations cause arousal and distraction, further leading the receiver to shift his or her attention to the other, the relationship, and the meaning of the violation.
# Communicator reward valence determines the interpretation of ambiguous communication.
# Communicator reward valence determines how the behavior is evaluated.
# Violation valences are determined by three factors:  (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) whether or not the behavior is more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation.  A positive violation occurs when the behavior is more favorable than the expectation.  A negative violation occurs when the behavior is less favorable.
# Positive violations produce more favorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations, and negative violations produce more unfavorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations.

Expectancy violations theory builds upon a number of communication [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; EVT assumes that humans have two competing needs:  A need for personal space and a need for [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; Specifically, humans all need a certain amount of personal space, also referred to as distance or privacy.&lt;ref name=Burgoon,1978 /&gt; People also desire a certain amount of closeness with others, or affiliation.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; EVT seeks to explain 'personal space', and the meanings that are formed when expectations of appropriate personal space are infringed or violated.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt;

Another feature of personal space is [[territoriality]]. Territoriality refers to behavior which "is characterized by identification with a geographic area in a way that indicates ownership" (Hall, 1966).&lt;ref name=Hall,1966&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=E. T.|title=The Hidden Dimension|year=1966|publisher=Anchor Books|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0385084765|pages=113–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, territoriality refers to an individual's sense of ownership over physical items, space, objects or ideas, and defensive behavior in response to territorial invasions.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Territoriality involves three territory types:  Primary territories, secondary territories and public territories.&lt;ref name=Altman,1975&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=I.|title=Environment and social behavior: Privacy, personal space, territory, and crowding|year=1975|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|location=Monterey, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary territories are considered exclusive to an individual.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Secondary territories are objects, spaces or places which "can be claimed temporarily" (Hall, 1966), but are neither central to the individual's life nor are exclusively owned.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt;  Public territories are "available to almost anyone for temporary ownership".&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Territoriality is frequently accompanied by prevention and reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0534625634|page=124|author=M. L. Knapp|edition=6th|author2=J. A. Hall|chapter=The Communication Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an individual perceives one of their needs has been compromised, EVT predicts that they will react. For instance, when an offensive violation occurs, the individual tends to react as though protecting their territory.

=== Proxemics ===
EVT offers an opportunity to study how individuals communicate through personal space. This part of the theory explains the notion of "[[personal space]]" and our reactions to others who appear to "violate" our sense of personal space.&lt;ref name="Burgoon 89"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgoon|first=J.|title=Nonverbal communication|year=1989|publisher=Harper&amp;Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; What we define as personal space, however, varies from culture to culture and from person to person. The "success" or "failure" of violations are linked to perceived attraction, credibility, influence and involvement. The context and purpose of interaction are relevant, as are the communicator characteristics of gender, relationships, status, social class, ethnicity and culture.&lt;ref name="Burgoon 89" /&gt; When it comes to different interactions between people, what each person expects out of the interaction will influence their individual willingness to risk violation. If a person feels comfortable in a situation, they are more likely to risk violation, and in turn will be rewarded for it.

Introduced by [[Edward T. Hall|Edward Hall in 1966]], [[Proxemics]] deals with the amount of distance between people as they interact with one another.&lt;ref name="Edward Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Edward|title=The Hidden Dimension|year=1966|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=0-385-08476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial distance during an interaction can be an indication of what type of relationship exists between the people involved.

[[File:Proxemics.png|thumb|
Personal Space Expectations diagram
]]

There are 4 different personal zones defined by Hall. These zones include:

# '''Intimate Distance:''' ''(0-18 inches)'' - This distance is for close, intimate encounters. Normally core family, close friends, [[Sexual partner|lovers]], or [[pet]]s. People will normally share a unique level of comfort with one another.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com"&gt;http://proxemics.weebly.com/types-of-proxemics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Personal Distance:''' ''(18 inches – 4 feet)'' - Reserved for conversations with [[friendship|friends]], [[extended family]], associates, and group discussions. The personal distance will give each person more space compared with the intimate distance, but is still close enough to involve touching one another.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com" /&gt;
# '''Social Distance:''' ''(4–10 feet)'' - This distance is reserved for newly formed groups, and new acquaintances and colleagues you may have just met. People generally do not engage physically with one another within this section.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com" /&gt; 
# '''Public Distance:''' ''(10 feet to infinity)'' - Reserved for a public setting with large [[audience]]s, strangers, [[Public speaking|speeches]], and [[theater]]s. 
&lt;ref name="Edward Hall" /&gt;

Many different cultures are influenced by [[Proxemics]] in different ways and respond differently to the same situation. In some cultures, those who have not formed close relationships may greet each other with kisses on the cheek, engaging one another well within the intimate range of proxemics.  In other cultures, a custom greeting is a handshake which maintains a physical separation but is well within personal distance.&lt;ref&gt;http://proxemics.weebly.com/proxemics-and-culture.html&lt;/ref&gt; Across the [[Proxemics|Proxemic]] Zones, actions can be interpreted differently among different cultures. For example, Japanese people do not address others by their first names unless they have been given permission. Calling someone by their first name in Japan without permission is considered an insult. In the Japanese culture, they address people using their last name and [[Japanese honorifics|'san']], which is equivalent to 'Mr.','Mrs.' and 'Ms.' in the English language. The way Japanese people address each other is an example of a verbal [[Proxemics|Proxemic]] zone. A Japanese person allowing another to call them by their first name is an example of intimate distance, because this is a privilege extended only someone very close to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://maki.typepad.com/justhungry/2009/08/when-to-use-chan-or-san-and-other-ways-to-address-people-in-japan-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Interpersonal communication ===
It is important to note that EVT can apply to both non-relational interaction and close relationships.  In 1998, more than twenty years after the theory was first published, several studies were conducted to catalog the types of expectancy violations commonly found in close relationships.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998" /&gt; Expectations with friends formulate over time and are usually brought together by a series of observations of behavior and predictions on how that friend will act in the future. When these expectations are violated, it often can be damaging and dangerous for a close friendship. It can cause an end to the friendship and bring a strong negative experience in that person's life. After time and experiences with that friend we might suspect them to act consistently around me in the way they have always acted, that is until a violation to this expectation takes place. For example, when they begin “breaking promises or even acting in an inauthentic manner to impress others, can have aversive consequences for close relationships” (Cohen 2010).  The fact is, we expect our friends to act in a social manner where they are adhere to all of our personal rules we set in our minds. That includes being nice, kind, considerate, and refraining from any comment that puts another down. This is a part of the personal rules we set within ourselves with a personal friendship, that is until we are in a different setting with that individual and they are around different people and the rules are broken. While this might be an offense in one’s eyes, it may not be offensive in the others. Each negative experience can deteriorate the relationship and allow more experiences where expectations are continually violated until the relationship is dissolved.   Cohen said “the more that a friendship is voluntary, easily replaceable, and disconnected from external pressures to continue, the more vulnerable it is to expectancy violation damage” (Cohen, 2010). Someone will always look for the better option if a negative experience has taken place. The more you are invested in a friendship with someone the stronger the effect will have on the individual when expectations are violated. There is also an interesting perspective of expectation violation when you throw gender into the picture. A friend that shares the same sex as you usually has a completely different feel to the relationship than a friendship with members of the opposite sex. Women are generally less tolerant with members of the opposite sex when violations have taken place. Relationships over time, whether it be with the same sex or not, tend to fail when the other will fall away from the behaviors and norms that the other is used to. This can be shown with hostile attitudes, sharp comments, distancing away from the other, etc. Both parties are also capable of violating each other's expectations at the same time. It is not just one person in the relationship that perceives behavior as unusual. One can respond to a violation with another social violation, leaving the friendship in confusion of direction it is going. 
 Participants in friendships and romantic relationships were asked to think about the last time their friend or partner did or said something unexpected. It was emphasized that the unexpected event could be either positive or negative. Participants reported events that had occurred, on average, five days earlier, suggesting that unexpected behaviors happen often in relationships. Some of the behaviors reported were relatively mundane, and others were quite serious. The outcome of the list was a list of nine general categories of expectation violations that commonly occur in relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Afifi|first=Walid|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=Sage Publication|pages=93|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JCDc0f4AGb0C&amp;pg=PA92|isbn=9781412977371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Support or confirmation'' is an act that provides social support in a particular time of need, such as sitting with a friend who is sick.
# ''[[Criticism]] or accusation'' is critical of the receiver and accuse the individual of an offense.  These are violations because they are accusations not expected.  An example is a ball player telling a teammate he should have caught the ball rather than supportively giving him or her a slap on the back and offering words of encouragement.  
# ''Relationship intensification or escalation'' intensifies the commitment of the communicator.  For instance, saying "I love you" signifies a deepening of a romantic relationship.
# ''Relationship de-escalation'' signifies a decrease in commitment of the communicator.  An example might be spending more time apart.
# ''[[Relational transgressions]]'' are violations of the perceived rules of the relationship.  Examples include having an affair, deception, or being disloyal.
# ''Acts of devotion'' are unexpected overtures that imply specialness in the relationship.  Buying flowers for no particular occasion falls into this category.
# ''Acts of disregard'' show that the partner is unimportant.  This could be as simple as excluding a partner or a friend from a collective activity.
# ''Gestures of inclusion'' are actions that show an unexpected interest in having the other included in special activities or life.  Examples include invitations to spend a special holiday with someone, disclosure of personal information, or inviting the partner to meet one's family.
# ''Uncharacteristic relational behavior'' is unexpected action that is not consistent with the partner's perception of the relationship.  A common example is one member of an opposite-sex friendship demanding a romantic relationship of the other.

In later review of the studies, the ''support or confirmation'' category was inserted into ''acts of devotion'' and included another category, ''uncharacteristic social behavior''.  These are acts that aren't relational but are unexpected, such as a quiet person raising his or her voice.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2001"&gt;Guerrero, L. K., Andersen, P. A., &amp; Afifi, W. A. (2001). Close Encounters: Communicating Relationships. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the response to expectancy violations, the sensitivity of expectancy violations varies from genders. Research found that women are less tolerant than men when their expectation are violated by negative behaviors, regardless of the types of violations such as dishonesty and immorality.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elizabeth L.|date=2010-05-07|title=Expectancy Violations in Relationships with Friends and Media Figures|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824091003737836|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=27|issue=2|pages=97–111|doi=10.1080/08824091003737836|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Romantic relationships ====
[[File:Romantic sunset Couple romance - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Application in interpersonal relationships-romantic relationships]]
Expectancy violations happen frequently in [[Romance (love)|romantic relationships]]. In relationships there is an unspoken expectation when interacting and that is the significant other will give their full undivided attention when in the presence of their significant other. As the new generation evolves we can see the face to face contact has changed. Unfortunately, with the access use of phones and social media the attention of individuals has shifted to their devices and continues to become worse. With the access to many mobile devices there has been an increase of lack of communication face to face. This has made it difficult for some relationships to grow and or has created conflict because the expectation of attention has been shifted. "Individuals expect conversational partners to be moderately involved in an interaction (Burgoon, Newton, Walther, &amp; Baesler, 1989). Within existing relationships, partners rely on one another to show interest and immediacy in interactions (White, 2008). However, the presence of cell phones and the expectation to be constantly available (Ling, 2012) impacts partners' abilities to give full attention to one another" (Miller-Ott, A., &amp; Kelly, L. 2015).

When romantic partners spend time together, both prefer gaining attention, intimacy, and feeling a close connection with each other. However, the usage of cell phones acts as a distractive behavior that drives romantic partner's attention to absent elements. Although romantic partners are more likely to be viewed as high reward communicators, their cell phone usage behaviors will be evaluated as negative in certain conditions and contexts.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Lynne|last2=Miller-Ott|first2=Aimee E.|last3=Duran|first3=Robert L.|date=2017-10-20|title=Sports Scores and Intimate Moments: An Expectancy Violations Theory Approach to Partner Cell Phone Behaviors in Adult Romantic Relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570314.2017.1299206|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=81|issue=5|pages=619–640|doi=10.1080/10570314.2017.1299206|issn=1057-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of where the romantic relationship takes place, people are likely to have negative valence about cell phone usage if their demand of attention and intimacy are violated.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The negative behaviors include texting, viewing news and playing games. In addition, large quantity of annoying cell phone usage during the date has great impact on romantic partner's negative valence towards the violated behaviors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, Miller-Ott and Kelly found that small amount of cell phone usage during date is acceptable, such as responding to a text message and quickly bringing attentiveness back to the date partner.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller-Ott|first=Aimee|last2=Kelly|first2=Lynne|date=2015-08-08|title=The Presence of Cell Phones in Romantic Partner Face-to-Face Interactions: An Expectancy Violation Theory Approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1041794X.2015.1055371|journal=Southern Communication Journal|volume=80|issue=4|pages=253–270|doi=10.1080/1041794x.2015.1055371|issn=1041-794X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same behavior in different occasions and contexts is viewed differently in terms of the degree of valence. Research found that same behavior is viewed as more negative in a restaurant than at home.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Since people are more likely to have higher expectations for undivided attention during formal contexts, using cell phone in formal dates will more negatively violate partner's expectations. Divided attention is acceptable in casual contexts – therefore, the degree of expectancy violations is low under a hanging out context.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===== Cell phone usage =====
Cell phone usage behaviors that do not contradict intimate moment are viewed as positive violations, including sharing interesting messages and playing online games together. People have less negative valence on cell phone usage if they gain more reward from the behaviors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Research also found the most common response to the violated cell phone usage is to do nothing.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, people have different reactions to the violations under different stages of romantic relationships. In the early stage of [[dating]], people are more likely to respond by indirect messages and silence. While there are direct verbal responses when expectations are violated in established relationships.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===== Sexual resistance =====
Sexual resistance is viewed as a typical expectancy violation in romantic relationships. In 2003, Bevan used EVT to evaluate the impact of sexual resistance on close relationships. The research focused on two considerations: relational contexts and directness of the messages.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Jennifer L.|date=March 1, 2013|title=Expectancy violation theory and sexual resistance in close, cross-sex relationships|url=|journal=Communication monographs|volume=70 |issue=1|pages=68–82|doi=10.1080/0363775032000104603|issn=0363-7751|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research concluded that people who are resisted in a romantic relationship perceived the violation of sexual resistance as more negative and unexpected than those resisted in a regular cross-sex friendship. The reason might because romantic partners believe that they have clearer and deeper understanding of each other's expectations and degree of acceptance and tolerance. When it comes to message directness of sexual resistance, although the study did not find any significant difference of levels of violation valence and expectedness between direct and indirect messages, direct sexual resistance messages in close relationships proved to be more relationally important than indirect messages. Therefore, direct sexual resistance messages will be a harmful factor that affects the continuity of a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

=== Computer-mediated communication and social media ===
As has previously been addressed, EVT has evolved tremendously over the years, expanding beyond its original induction when it focused on FtF communication and proxemics. The advancement of [[information and communications technology]] has provided tools for expressing oneself and conveying messages beyond just typing in text.  As already discussed, arousal can divert one's attention or interest from a message
to the source of the arousal.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Virtual realities
created online through [[computer-mediated communication]], especially those which evoke
strong visual presence through media, can increase arousal levels, such as those
with high violent or sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = At the Heart of It All: The Concept of Presence|url = |journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date = 1997-09-01|pages = 0|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x|first = Matthew|last = Lombard|first2 = Theresa|last2 = Ditton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just
as people may use television viewing to increase or decrease arousal levels, people
may use media in online communication to increase or decrease arousal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Responding to the Screen: Reception and reaction processes|last = Zillmann|first = D.|publisher = Erlbaum|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Hillsdale, NJ|pages = 103–134|work = Television and physiological arousal|editor-last = Bryant|editor-first = J.|editor-last2 = Zillmann|editor-first2 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People may interact with others online by assuming
the identities of [[Avatars United|avatars]] which may take on completely different, alternate personalities.
The differences in perceived intimateness, co-presence, and emotionally-based trust can very significantly between avatar communication and other communication modalities such as text chat, audio, and audio-visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Avatar-Mediated Networking: Increasing Social Presence and Interpersonal Trust in Net-Based Collaborations|url = |journal = Human Communication Research|date = 2008-04-01|issn = 1468-2958|pages = 287–318|volume = 34|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.2008.00322.x|first = Gary|last = Bente|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Rüggenberg|first3 = Nicole C.|last3 = Krämer|first4 = Felix|last4 = Eschenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The media options available to users when communicating
with others online present a host of potential expectancy violations unique to CMC.

The introduction of social media networks such as [[Facebook Home|Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as dating social networks such as [[Match.com]] and [[eHarmony]], has greatly contributed to the increased use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) which now offers a context for studying communication devoid of nonverbal information. Though these media are relatively new, they have been in existence long enough for users to have developed norms and expectations about appropriate behaviors in the online world.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/98060925|title = When You Stalk Me, Please Don't Tell Me About It: Facebook and Expectancy Violation Theory|last = Fife|first = Eric M.|date = Spring 2009|journal = The Kentucky Journal of Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015|last2 = Nelson|first2 = C. Leigh|issue = 1|volume = 28|pages = 41–54|issn = 1533-3140|first3 = Kristine|last3 = Bayles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there has been a lag by researchers to study and understand these new established norms, which makes CMC rich with heuristic possibilities from a communications theory perspective.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Ramirez and Wang studied the occurrence and timing of modality switching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.020 | volume=29 | issue=4 | title=When online meets offline: A field investigation of modality switching | journal=Computers in Human Behavior | pages=1565–1571| year=2013 | last1=McEwan | first1=Bree | last2=Zanolla | first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; or shifts from online communication to FtF interaction, from the perspective of EVT.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Online Meets Offline: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective on Modality Switching|url =|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2008-03-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 20–39|volume = 58|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00372.x|first = Artemio|last = Ramirez|first2 = Zuoming|last2 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research documented inconsistent findings which revealed in some instances relationships were enhanced and in others they were dampened, indicating the expectations, evaluations, and outcomes associated with initial modality switches varied amongst individuals.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Additionally, studies have found that when individuals who meet online meet face-to-face for the first time, the length of time spent communicating online can determine whether individuals will rate physical characteristics of each other positively or negatively.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Unlike FtF communication, CMC allows people to pretend to be connected with a person who violates their expectancy by ignoring violations or filtering news feed. Meanwhile, people can also cut the connection completely with someone who is not important by deleting friendship status when a serious violation occurs. A confrontation is much more likely for close friends than for acquaintances, and compensation is much more likely for acquaintances, a finding which contrasts typical EVT predictions.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Norm evolution and violation on Facebook|url = |journal = New Media &amp; Society|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 1461-4448|pages = 299–315|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1461444811412712|first = Caitlin|last = McLaughlin|first2 = Jessica|last2 = Vitak}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, EVT on the Internet environment is strongly related to online privacy issues.

==== Facebook ====
[[File:Facebook logo.png|thumb|Application in computer-mediated communication and social media-Facebook]]
In social media such as Facebook, people are connected online with friends and sometimes strangers. Norm violations on Facebook may include too many status updates, overly emotional status updates or Wall posts, heated interactions, name calling through Facebook's public features, and tags on posts or pictures that might reflect negatively on an individual.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Research has also shown that the act of unfriending on Facebook is perceived as a highly negative expectancy violation, with the duration of the Facebook friendship and personal ties to the unfriending party dictating how negatively the act is perceived. Moreover, the importance of the violation was also found to dictate whether the unfriending person informed the other individual of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Being unfriended on Facebook: An application of Expectancy Violation Theory|url = |journal = Computers in Human Behavior|date = 2014-04-01|pages = 171–178|volume = 33|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.029|first = Jennifer L.|last = Bevan|first2 = Pei-Chern|last2 = Ang|first3 = James B.|last3 = Fearns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Fife, Nelson, and Bayles of focus groups from a Southeastern liberal arts university, five themes were ascertained regarding Facebook use and expectancy violations:&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* ''""Don't stalk' – and when you do, don't talk about it"''
** Though an understanding exists among Facebook participants that users will use the site to keep track of the behavior of others in a number of ways, excessive monitoring is likely to be perceived as an expectancy violation.
* "''Don't embarrass me with bad pictures''"
** Users may have the ability to control which pictures they post on their own Facebook page, but they do not have the ability to control what others post.  Posting and "tagging" unflattering pictures of others may create expectancy violations.
* "''Don't mess up my profile''"
** Several participants expressed annoyance of others who alter their profiles knowing that their alterations could be perceived negatively, though they did not mention changing their passwords or protecting themselves in other ways.
* "''Choose an appropriate forum for messages''"
** Messages can be sent between Facebook participants through 'Facebook messages', which are not public, or 'wall postings', which can be viewed by anyone specified in the user's privacy controls.  Posting messages which may be perceived as private, embarrassing, or inappropriate to a wall posting can create expectancy violations.
* "''Don't compete over number of friends''"
** Facebook users maintain a running total of 'friends' on their profile which is viewable to others.  Engaging in comparisons with others over this statistic can create expectancy violations. 
In 2010, Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield examined college undergraduates' motivations to have friends-only profiles on Facebook. Having a friends-only profile is a practical method to enhance privacy management on Facebook. The two authors made distinctions between intended audience, to whom one hopes to disclose the Facebook profile, and expected audience, a group of people by whom one thinks the Facebook profile has been viewed.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutzman|first=Fred|last2=Kramer-Duffield|first2=Jacob|date=2010|title=Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-enhancing Behavior in Facebook|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1753326.1753559|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1553–1562|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753559|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicated that "expectancy violations were identified as instances where an expected audience was not jointly identified as an intended audience".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Facebook networks were categorized into different levels: strong ties of family and intimate friends, weak ties comprising "casual friends and campus acquaintances", and outsiders such as "faculty or administrators". According to the study, expectancy violations by weak ties showed greater relevance to the establishment of a friends-only profile among college undergraduates, compared to other Facebook network ties.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Electronic mail ====
[[Email]] has become one of the most widely used methods of communication within [[Organizational communication|organizations]] and workplaces.  When discussing expectancy violations
with electronic e-mail, just as with other modes of communication, a distinction
must be made between inadvertent violations of norms and purposeful violations,
referred to as '[[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]'.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Sullivan|first=Patrick B.|last2=Flanagin|first2=Andrew J.|date=2003|title=Reconceptualizing 'flaming' and other problematic messages|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|edition=1|location=London, Thousand Oaks, CA and New Delhi|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=5|pages=69–94|doi=10.1177/1461444803005001908|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = November 13, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Flaming
is defined as hostile and aggressive interactions via text-based CMC.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

One form of expectancy violation in email is the length of time between the sending of the initial email and the receiver's reply. Communicator reward valence plays a large part in how expectancy violations are handled in email communications. In computer-mediated communication, people have expectations to others’ online behaviors based on individual identity. In online contexts, violations are not simply assessed as positive or negative. Some violations are ambiguous such as e-mail response latency. In 2017, Nicholls and Rice stated that “when deviation is ambiguous, the communicator’s reward value will mediate the perceptions of the deviation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Spencer Byron|last2=Rice|first2=Ronald E.|date=2017-08-01|title=A Dual-Identity Model of Responses to Deviance in Online Groups: Integrating Social Identity Theory and Expectancy Violations Theory|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/comt.12113/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=243–268|doi=10.1111/comt.12113|issn=1468-2885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronemics|Chronemic]] studies on email have shown that in organizations, responder status played a large part in how individuals reacted to various lapses in response to the previously sent email.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Academic environment ===

==== Teacher anger ====
[[File:Urban Affairs classroom.jpg|thumb|Application in academic environment]]
McPherson, Kearney, and Plax examined teacher anger in college classrooms through the lens of norm violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of norm violations|url=http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/social/examples_of_norm_violations.htm|publisher=Radford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Dark Side of Instruction: Teacher Anger as Classroom Norm Violations|url = |journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 0090-9882|pages = 76–90|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00909880305376|first = Mary B.|last = McPherson|first2 = Patricia|last2 = Kearney|first3 = Timothy G.|last3 = Plax}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally, teachers will become frustrated and angry with students in classrooms from time to time.  How teachers express themselves and convey those
emotions will determine how students respond and interpret those emotional demonstrations.
The students judged the appropriateness of teachers' anger in classrooms in the modal expressions of distributive aggression, passive aggression, integrative assertion, and nonassertive denial.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Students rated the aggressive expressions as
highly intense, destructive, and inappropriate (or non-normative), including such behaviors as [[sarcasm]] or putdowns (most
frequently cited), [[verbal abuse]], rude and condescending behaviors toward students, and acts intended to demoralize students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advice for New Faculty Members|last = Boice|first = R.|publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Needham Heights, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Classroom incivilities|last = Boice|first = R.|date = 1996|journal = Research in Higher Education|doi = 10.1007/bf01730110|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|issue = 4|pages = 453–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Faculty development via field programs for middle-aged,  disillusioned faculty|last = Boice|first = R.|date = 1986|journal = Research in Higher Education|doi = 10.1007/bf00991486|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 115–135|publication-date = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students described assertive displays as appropriate and less intense.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Although anger is often considered to be a negative emotion, teacher anger is not necessarily a violation of classroom norms.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Based on the study, intense and aggressive displays of teacher anger are considered socially inappropriate by students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  These perceived norm violations result in negative evaluations of the teacher and the course.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Because only integrative-assertive expressions of teacher anger were positively related to students' perceptions of appropriateness, the study concluded that teachers should avoid intense, aggressive anger displays and should rather assertively and directly discuss the problem with students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== Teacher dress ====
[[Clothing]] is considered a form of nonverbal communication. [[Dress]] communicates status, [[hierarchy]], [[credibility]], and attractiveness. Specific social codes dictate what forms of dress are appropriate in various cross-cultural contexts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Clothing and Teacher Credibility: An Application of Expectancy Violations Theory|last = Dunbar|first = Norah|date = 2011|journal = ISRN Education|accessdate = |doi = 10.5402/2012/140517|pmid = |volume = 2012|last2 = Segrin|first2 = Chris |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Influence of Dress on Perceptions of Intelligence and Expectations of Scholastic Achievement|last = Behling|first = D.U.|date = 1991|journal = Clothing and Textiles Research Journal|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0887302x9100900401|pmid = |last2 = Williams|first2 = E.A.|volume = 9|issue = 4|pages = 1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals wear clothing that is deemed inappropriate for a given situation, or when an individual's clothing does not seem to match their perceived status or attractiveness, this can constitute an expectancy violation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Studies on clothing and teacher perceptions have shown that when teachers wear [[Formality|formal]] attire, students rate their credibility higher. However, for high-reward teachers, clothing formality did not raise perceptions of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Appropriateness and Promotability of Clothing Behavior of Women Teachers|last = Fitch|first = E.M.|publisher = Yeshiva University|year = 1984|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Effects of Source Attire on Judgments of Credibility|last = Bassett|first = R.E.|date = 1984|journal = Central States Speech Journal|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/10510977909368022|pmid = |volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 282–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students seem to retain information best when teachers are dressed moderately, and teacher value appears to derive from what grade students predict they will get from a teacher more so than clothing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Instructor credibility in college classroom ====
Generally, students have expectations to their instructors in college classroom. According to Sidelinger and Bolen, students might be dissatisfied about instructors who talk a lot during class.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidelinger|first=Robert J.|last2=Bolen|first2=Derek M.|date=2016-01-02|title=Instructor Credibility as a Mediator of Instructors’ Compulsive Communication and Student Communication Satisfaction in the College Classroom|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2015.1117438|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–31|doi=10.1080/08824096.2015.1117438|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they did the research about the compulsive communication and communication satisfaction, they concluded that if an instructor is evaluated as credible by the students, his credibility decreases students’ dissatisfaction despite of his talkativeness. Particularly, instructor’s goodwill such as [[politeness]] and care for students is the most effective characteristic to alleviate students’ negative feelings towards a talkative instructor.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

==== Course ratings ====
Most American colleges and universities employ course rating surveys as a method to gauge teacher effectiveness and the degree to which students are satisfied with the pedagogy of their professors. Expectancy violation and violation valence play a part in course ratings because a wide range of expectancies exist for students while taking a course.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Expectations, Observations, and Violations: Comparing Their Effects on Course Ratings|last = Gigliotti|first = R.J.|date = 1987|journal = Research in Higher Education|accessdate = |doi = 10.1007/bf00992374|pmid = |volume = 26|issue = 4 |pages=401–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common expectancies for students include stimulation and interest, instructor behavior, relevance of the course, and the student's expected and actual success in the course. A higher education study on EVT and course ratings analyzed 228 students in seven introductory sociology classes at a university of 25,000 students.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since the courses were required for most students, were open to all students, used the same textbook, and met for the same length of time during the semester, expectancy violations in the classroom could be reported more accurately.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some factors used to report the data included instructor personality, interestingness and informativeness of textbook materials, difficulty of lectures, lecturer speaking ability, and the ability to answer questions. At the end of the study, the only factor that affected course ratings was relevance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Expectancies had virtually no effect otherwise on course evaluations. This reason could be attributed to the fact that students who found a course highly relevant were already interested in the subject area and were more motivated to do well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Nontraditional college students ====
EVT has been used to study the experiences of [[Non-traditional student|non-traditional]] [[college]] and [[university]] students who begin an [[undergraduate education]] over the age of 25.  The study focused on the students' expectations of their professors and how they should behave in the classroom. Since nontraditional students often feel that they are different from their academic peers, and since the traditional university setting focuses on the 18-23-year-old [[Demographics|demographic]], studying nontraditional student classroom experiences can help higher education institutions instruct teachers on how to behave in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Expectancy Violations as Predictors of Motivation and Learning: A Comparison of Traditional and Nontraditional Students|last = Houser|first = Marian|date = 2006|journal = Communication Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/01463370600878248|pmid = |volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 331–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Adult Learner: A Neglected Species, 2nd Edition|last = Knowles|first = M.S.|publisher = Gulf Publishing|year = 1978|isbn = |location = Houston, TX|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional and non-traditional students have been shown to expect teachers to make use of examples, provide feedback, and adequately prepare them for exams.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Both traditional and non-traditional students have been found to have their expectations for instructor clarity negatively violated.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Surprisingly, non-traditional students differed from traditional students by responding negatively to affinity-seeking behaviors and believed that instructors should be less concerned with making class more fun and enjoyable.

==== Student disclosures in college classroom ====
In 2013, Frisby and Sidelinger conducted a research about student disclosures in college classroom, which discussed about what kinds of student disclosures would violate peers’ expectations and their perceptions about the disclosers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frisby|first=Brandi N.|last2=Sidelinger|first2=Robert J.|date=2013-07-01|title=Violating Student Expectations: Student Disclosures and Student Reactions in the College Classroom|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510974.2012.755636|journal=Communication Studies|volume=64|issue=3|pages=241–258|doi=10.1080/10510974.2012.755636|issn=1051-0974}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, those who make inappropriate disclosures violate others’ expectations most in a classroom environment. Inappropriate disclosures are described as high frequent, negative, offensive and irrelevant topics. Disclosers of inappropriate information are more likely to be described as incompetent students, and they are less likeable than students who disclose appropriate information that are related to course materials.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==== College admissions ====
A 2008 study of the top 500 US colleges by Kaplan found that 10% of admissions offices checked applicants' social networking site (SNS) profiles, and 38% of those saw information that reduced the applicants' prospects for admission.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;  In 2011, a college student was cited for underage drinking after campus police found pictures on Facebook of
the student holding a beer.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
[[File:Profaneco.png|thumb|Application in profanity use]]

=== Profanity use ===
Swearing and cursing are some of the most readily observable instances of verbal expectancy violations. Examples of swearing expectancy violations include U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney telling Patrick Leahy, Senator of Vermont, to "go fuck yourself",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==== In workplaces ====
Swearing is common among many workplaces. Swearing has been identified functionally as one of several ways to express emotion in response to workplace stress, to convey verbal aggression, or to engage in deviant workplace behavior (Johnson, 2012). In formal work settings, people have much stronger feelings that their expectations are violated by swearing than in casual occasions. Expletives are more prevalent in unstructured conversations than in more structured, task-oriented ones (Johnson, 2012). The use of [[profanity]] has been shown to influence the perceptions of speakers. It may also have emotional impact on the user and the audience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reactions to Obscene Language|last = Hamilton|first = M.A.|date = 1989|journal = Communication Research Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/08824098909359835|pmid = |volume = 6|pages = 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What the ____ Is Your Problem?: Attribution Theory and Perceived Reasons for Profanity Usage During Conflict|last = Young|first = S.L.|date = 2004|journal = Communication Research Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/08824090409359998|pmid = |volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 338–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that profanity users appear less trustworthy, less sociable, and less educated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Why We Curse|last = Jay|first = T.|publisher = John Benjamins|year = 1999|isbn = 9781556197581|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more swearing messages one expresses that violate respondent's expectations in workplaces, the more negative evaluations the respondent will generate about the speaker's incompetency.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Danette Ifert|last2=Lewis|first2=Nicole|date=2010-10-13|title=Perceptions of Swearing in the Work Setting: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08934215.2010.511401|journal=Communication Reports|volume=23|issue=2|pages=106–118|doi=10.1080/08934215.2010.511401|issn=0893-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits are likely to appear as fixed among profanity users.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Moreover, the content of the swearing messages also poses great impact on the extent of expectancy violations in formal work settings. The verbal messages include words related to sex, [[excretion]] and profaneness. Research found that respondents experience highest level of surprise about the swearing with sexual expressions. Thus their expectations are more likely to be violated by sexual swearing than excretory and profane words. A more productive approach than focusing on whether a specific word is offensive may be to make sure that those engaging in workplace swearing are aware of how they and their messages might be perceived in multiple ways (Johnson, 2012).&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Evaluation of media figures ===
Expectancy violations are tightly related to the changes of people's evaluation on their relationships with media figures. In 2010, Cohen made comparisons between relationships with friends and media figures in order to find similarities and differences of people's reactions when their expectations are violated in these two relationships. Violations were generally divided in three categories: social violations such as making offensive comments, trust violations such as making up stories about their life experience, and moral violations such as cheating in a marital relationship or drunk driving.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Research indicated that in both friendships and relationships with media figures, social and trust violations are more offensive than moral violations. Specifically, people are more intolerable about moral violations from media figures than from their friends. According to the study, the reason for the intolerance is because relationships with media figures are relatively weak that people invest less on the relationships with media figures than on friendships.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;
The type of media figures is also an important factor to determine the changes of closeness with media figures. People have different expectations to various types of media figures. Research discussed that moral violations negatively influence relationships with athletes, damaging their positive and energetic appearance expected by the public. Social violations reduce closeness with TV hosts, whom people expect as amiable public figures.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Health and self-improvement ===
Expectancy violation theory has even been applied to encouraging healthy habits and changing bad ones. In a study by Karolien van den Akker,  Myrr van den Broek, Remco C. Havermans, and Anita Jansen, expectancy violation theory was tested to see if it was successful in changing ingrained cravings for chocolate. Although researchers did not find that expectancy violation mediated responses to chocolate cravings, they believe more research is needed to determine whether this theory is profitable for this kind of application to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Akker|first=Karolien|last2=Broek|first2=Myrr van den|last3=Havermans|first3=Remco C.|last4=Jansen|first4=Anita|title=Violation of eating expectancies does not reduce conditioned desires for chocolate|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.02.004|journal=Appetite|volume=100|pages=10–17|doi=10.1016/j.appet.2016.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metatheoretical assumptions ==

=== Ontological assumptions ===

EVT assumes that humans have a certain degree of free will.  This theory assumes that humans can assess and interpret the relationship and liking between themselves and their conversational partner, and then make a decision whether or not to violate the expectations of the other person. The theory holds that this decision depends on what outcome they would like to achieve.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K.|author2=White, C. H.|title=Adaptation and communicative design|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2001|volume=27|issue=1|pages=9–37|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00774.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assumption is based on the ''interaction position''. The interaction position is based on a person's initial stance toward an interaction as determined by a blend of personal Requirements, Expectations, and Desires (RED). These ''RED'' factors meld into our interaction position of what's needed, anticipated, and preferred.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2001"/&gt;

=== Epistemological assumptions ===

EVT assumes that there are norms for all communication activities and if these norms are violated, there will be specific, predictable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"/&gt; EVT does not fully account for the overwhelming prevalence of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] that has been found in interpersonal interactions. Secondly, it is silent on whether communicator valence supersedes behavior valence or vice versa when the two are incongruent, such as when a disliked partner engages in a positive violation.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"/&gt;

=== Axiological assumptions ===

This theory seeks to be value-neutral as supporting studies have been conducted empirically and sought to objectively describe how humans react when their expectations are violated.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"/&gt;

== Critique ==

=== Predictability and testability ===
Expectancy violations theory has undergone scrutiny for its attempt to provide a covering law for certain aspects of interpersonal communication. Some critics of EVT believe most interactions between individuals are extremely complex and there are many contingencies to consider within the theory. This makes the prediction of behavioral outcomes of a particular situation virtually impossible to consistently predict.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts|last=Miller|first=K.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2005|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique of the theory is the assumption that expectancy violations are mostly highly consequential acts, negative in nature, and cause uncertainty to increase between communicators.  In actuality, research shows expectancy violations vary in frequency, seriousness, and valence.  While it is true that many expectancy violations carry a negative [[Valence (psychology)|valence]], numerous are positive and actually reduce uncertainty because they provide additional information within the parameters of the particular relationship, context, and communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Characteristics and Consequences of Expectation Violations in Close Relationships|last = Afifi|first = Walid|date = 1998|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407598153004|pmid = |first2 = Sandra|last2 = Metts|volume = 15|issue = 3 |pages=365–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''A First Look at Communication'' ====
Emory Griffin, the author of ''A First Look at Communication Theory'', analyzed unpredictability in expectancy violations theory.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt; His test consisted in analyzing his interaction with four students who made various requests from him. The students were given the pseudonyms Andre, Belinda, Charlie and Dawn. They start with the letters A, B, C and D to represent the increasing distance between them and Griffin when making their requests.

[[File:Expectancy Violations in a Classroom Setting.jpg|thumb|
Adapted from Griffin's diagram in the book A first look at communication theory.
]]

Andre needed the author's endorsement for a graduate scholarship, and spoke to him from an intimate eyeball-to-eyeball distance. According to Burgoon's early model, Andre made a mistake when he crossed Griffin's ''threat threshold''; the physical and psychological discomfort the lecturer might feel could have hurt his cause. However, later that day Griffin wrote the letter of recommendation.

Belinda needed help with a term paper for a class with another professor, and asked for it from a 2-foot distance. Just as Burgoon predicted, the narrow gap between Belinda and Griffin determined him to focus his attention on their rocky relationship, and her request was declined.

Charlie invited his lecturer to play water polo with other students, and he made the invitation from the right distance of 7 feet, just outside the range of interaction Griffin anticipated. However, his invitation was declined.

Dawn launched an invitation to Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this from across the room. According to the nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation from across the room would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful.

Griffin's attempt to apply Burgoon's original model to conversational distance between him and his students didn't meet with much success. The theoretical scoreboard read:
: Nonverbal expectancy violations model: '''1'''
: Unpredicted random behavior: '''3'''

However, when Grifffin applied the revised EVT standards on his responses to "the proxemic violations of Andre, Belinda, Charlie, and Dawn," the scorecard "shows four hits and no misses."&lt;ref&gt;A First Look at Communication Theory, 9th edition, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

Because EVT is [[Social psychology|sociopsychological]] in nature and focuses on social codes in both [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal communication]], it is closely related to communication theories such as [[cognitive dissonance]] and [[uncertainty reduction theory]]. Recently, this theory has undergone some reconstitution by Burgoon and her colleagues and has resulted in a newly proposed theory known as [[Interpersonal adaptation theory|interaction adaptation theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/52575_Gamble_%28IC%29_Chapter_1.pdf|title=Interpersonal Communication: Building Connections Together|last1=Gamble|first1=Teri Susan Kwal|last2=Gamble|first2=Michael W.|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452220130|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a more comprehensive explanation of adaptation in interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;

As mentioned above, EVT has strong roots in [[uncertainty reduction theory]].  The relationship between violation behavior and the level of uncertainty is under study.  Research indicates that violations differ in their impact on uncertainty. To be more specific, incongruent negative violations heightened uncertainty, whereas congruent violations (both positive and negative) caused declines in uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2000.tb00756.x|title=The impact of violations on uncertainty and the consequences for attractiveness|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=203–233|year=2000|last1=Afifi|first1=WA|last2=Burgoon|first2=JK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also borrows from social exchange theory in that people seek reward out of interaction with others.

Two other theories share similar outlooks to EVT – Discrepancy-Arousal Theory and Patterson's [[Social facilitation|social facilitation model]] (SFM).  Like EVT, DAT explains that a receiver becomes aroused when a communicative behavior does not match the receiver's expectations.  In DAT, these differences are called discrepancies instead of expectancy violations. [[Cognitive dissonance]] and EVT both try to explain why and how people react to unexpected information and adjust themselves during communication process.

The social facilitation model has a similar outlook and labels these differences as unstable changes.  A key difference between the theories lies in the receiver's arousal level.  Both DAT and SFM maintain that the receiver experiences a physiological response whereas EVT focuses on the attention shift of the receiver.  EVT posits that expectancy violations occur frequently and are not always as serious as perceived through the lenses of other theories.

[[Anxiety/uncertainty management|Anxiety/uncertainty management theory]] is the uncertainty and Anxiety people have towards each other, relating to EVT this anxiety and uncertainty can differ between cultures. Causing a violation for example violating someones personal distance or communicating ineffectively can cause uncertainty and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt;

The popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as means of conducting task-oriented and socially oriented interactions is a part of the [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) theory. Coined by Joseph Walther, the theory explores CMC's ability to fulfill many of the same functions as the more traditional forms of interaction, especially face-to-face (FtF) interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interpersonal Effects in Computer-Mediated Interaction A Relational Perspective|url = http://crx.sagepub.com/content/19/1/52|journal = Communication Research|date = 1992-02-01|issn = 0093-6502|pages = 52–90|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/009365092019001003|first = Joseph B.|last = Walther}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cues Filtered Out, Cues Filtered In: Computer-Mediated Communication and Relationships|last = Walther|first = J.B.|date = 2002|journal = Handbook of Interpersonal Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Sage|edition = 3rd|pages = 529–563|location = Thousand Oaks, California|editor-last = Knapp|editor-first = M.L.|editor2-last = Daly|editor2-first = J.A.|last2 = Parks|first2 = M.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SIP can be used in conjunction with EVT to examine interpersonal and hyperpersonal relationships established through CMC.

== Further use and development of the theory ==

The concept of [[social norms marketing]] follows expectancy violation in that it is based upon the notion that messages containing facts that vary from perception of the norm will create a positive expectancy violation.  Advertising, strategic communications, and public relations base social norms campaigns on this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campo | first1 = S. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Brossard | first3 = D. | last4 = Frazer | first4 = M. S. | year = 2004 | title = Social Norms and Expectancy Violation Theories: Assessing the Effectiveness of Health Communication Campaigns | url = | journal = Communication Monographs | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 448–470 | doi=10.1080/0363452042000307498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction adaptation theory further explores expectancy violations.  Developed by [[Judee K. Burgoon|Burgoon]] to take a more comprehensive look at social interaction, IAT posits that people enter into interactions with requirements, expectations, and desires.  These factors influence both the initial behavior as well as the response behavior.  When faced with behavior that meets an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, the response behavior will be positive.  When faced with behavior that does not meet an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, he or she can respond either positively or negatively depending on the degree of violation and positive or negative valence of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, K. &amp; Ray, G. (2005). [http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/1/4/0/6/pages14068/p14068-1.php Adaptation to Expressed Liking and Disliking in Initial Interactions: Nonverbal Involvement and Pleasantness Response Patterns]. Conference Papers -- International Communication Association Annual Meeting, 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgoon | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Le Poire | first2 = B. A. | last3 = Rosenthal | first3 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Effects of Preinteraction Expectancies and Target Communication on Perceiver Reciprocity and Compensation in Dyadic Interaction | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 287–321 | doi=10.1006/jesp.1995.1014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectancies exert significant influence on people's interaction patterns, on their impressions of one another, and on the outcomes of their interactions. People who can assume that they are well regarded by their audience are safer engaging in violations and more likely to profit from doing so than are those who are poorly regarded.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K. |author2=D. A. Coker |author3=R. A. Coker|title=Communicative Effects of Gaze Behavior|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2006|volume=12|issue=4|pages=495–524|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1986.tb00089.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the violation act is one that is likely to be ambiguous in its meaning or to carry multiple interpretations that are not uniformly positive or negative, then the reward valence of the communicator can be especially significant in moderating interpretations, evaluations, and subsequent outcomes.

EVT also applies to international experience in the workplace. “A foreign newcomer who has the necessary education, work experience, and international experience will be perceived as having the ability to make valuable contribution to the group’s task. Consequently, education, work experience and international experience will influence a foreign newcomer’s initial task-based group acceptance (Joardar, 2011). It can be argued that a person with significant international experience will be perceived as having had the opportunity to learn how to build valuable relationships in a cross-cultural setting. Hence, international experience will have effects on initial relationship-based group acceptance as well. Meaning, this will make for a more positive expectancy violation, in the workplace especially. 
EVT is also used as a framework to analyze the negative impact of mind reading expectations on romantic relationships. In 2015, Wright and Roloff explained the idea of mind reading expectations (MRE) that romantic partners should clearly know about each other's feelings even though they are not being informed. When relational partners have done something wrong without [[self-consciousness]], people's expectations are violated. Particularly those who hold high value of MRE are more likely to become distressful once their relational partners are unaware of their violations to expectations. The study asserted that such kinds of violations related to MRE result in responses such as combative attitude and silent treatment, which is harmful to long-term romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Courtney N.|last2=Roloff|first2=Michael E.|date=2015-01-02|title=You Should Just Know Why I'm Upset: Expectancy Violation Theory and the Influence of Mind Reading Expectations (MRE) on Responses to Relational Problems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2014.989969|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=32|issue=1|pages=10–19|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.989969|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fortsas hoax''' refers to an incident in [[Binche|Binche, Belgium]], in 1840.  That year, booksellers, librarians, and collectors of rare books throughout [[Europe]] received a catalogue describing a collection of rare books to be auctioned.

According to the message, "Jean Nepomucene Auguste Pichauld, Comte de Fortsas", had been a collector of unique books — books of which only one copy was known to exist.  When he had died, on September 1, 1839, he had possessed 52 such books.  His heirs, not interested in collecting books, had decided to auction the collection.  The auction was to be held on August 10, 1840.

On the appointed date, numerous collectors and intellectuals gathered in Binche, hoping to bid on the books.  They learned, however, that the offices of the notary where the auction was to take place did not exist — nor did the street upon which the offices were supposedly located.  Notices which had been posted around Binche claimed that there would be no auction after all, because the town's public library had acquired the books; however, those attempting to visit the library to view the collection discovered that Binche possessed no public library.  Later it was discovered that there had never been a Comte de Fortsas.

It was eventually revealed that the hoax had been planned and carried out by antiquarian and retired military officer [[Renier Hubert Ghislain Chalon]], who enjoyed playing elaborate [[prank]]s on intellectuals.

Ironically, the original catalogue of fictitious unique books Chalon had sent to his victims has itself become a sought-after collectors' item.  It has since been reprinted several times.

The '''German Reference Corpus''' (original: '''Deutsches Referenzkorpus'''; short: '''DeReKo''') is an electronic archive of [[text corpus|text corpora]] of [[German language|contemporary written German]]. It was first created in 1964 and is hosted at the Institute for the German Language (IDS) in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]]. The corpus archive is continuously updated and expanded. It currently comprises more than 4.0 billion word tokens (as of August 2010) and constitutes the largest linguistically motivated collection of contemporary German texts. Today, it is one of the major resources worldwide for the study of written German.

==Alternative names==

The German Reference Corpus is often referred to by other names, such as ''Mannheim corpora'', ''IDS corpora'', ''COSMAS corpora'' and the corresponding German translations. The name ''Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)'' was originally used for a specific portion of the current archive which was collected between 1999 and 2002 by a number of institutions in a joint project under the same name. Since 2004, ''Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)'' is the official name of the full corpus archive.

==Conception and composition==

The German Reference Corpus comprises fictional and academic texts, a large number of newspaper texts and several other text types. The texts cover the time range from around 1950 to the present.

In contrast to other well-known corpora and corpus archives (such as the [[British National Corpus]]), however, the German Reference Corpus is explicitly not designed as a ''balanced corpus'': The distribution of DeReKo texts across time or text types does not match some predefined percentages.

This conception complies with the fact that whether or not a given corpus constitutes a balanced or even representative language [[sample (statistics)|sample]] may only be assessed with respect to a specific language domain (i.e., the [[statistical population]]). Because different linguistic investigations generally aim at different language domains, the declared purpose of the German Reference Corpus is to serve as a versatile superordinate sample, or ''[[primordial sample]]'' (German: ''Ur-Stichprobe'') of contemporary written German, from which corpus users may draw a specialised subsample (a so-called ''[[virtual corpus]]'') to represent the language domain they wish to investigate.

==Access==

Due to copyright and licence restrictions, the DeReKo archive may not be copied nor offered for download. It can be queried and analyzed free of charge via the system ''COSMAS II'' - end-users are required to register by name and to agree to use the corpus data exclusively for non-commercial, academic purposes. ''COSMAS II'' enables users to compile from DeReKo a ''virtual corpus'' suitable for their specific research questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">'''Grammar systems theory''' is a field of [[theoretical computer science]] that studies [[system]]s of finite collections of [[formal grammar]]s generating a [[formal language]]. Each grammar works on a string, a so-called ''sequential form'' that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of [[Intelligent agent|agents]] in [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"&gt;

[[Image:Grammar system diagram.svg|thumb|450px|right|System of grammars sequentially rewriting shared string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;]] Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G_A}&lt;/math&gt; be a formal grammar which generates language &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}&lt;/math&gt;. The behavior of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is then described by this grammar. Suppose the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[subsumption architecture]]; each component of this architecture can be then represented as a formal grammar too and the final behavior of the agent is then described by this ''system of grammars''.

The schema on the right describes such a system of grammars which shares a common string representing an environment. The shared sequential form is sequentially rewritten by each grammar, which can represent either a component or generally an agent.

If grammars communicate together and work on a shared sequential form, it is called a ''Cooperating Distributed (DC)'' grammar system. Shared sequential form is a similar concept to the blackboard approach in [[AI]],&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt; which is inspired by an idea of experts solving some problem together while they share their proposals and ideas on a shared blackboard.

Each grammar in a grammar system can also work on its own string and communicate with other grammars in a system by sending their sequential forms on request. Such a grammar system is then called a ''Parallel Communicating (PC)'' grammar system.&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

PC and DC are inspired by distributed AI.  If there is no communication between grammars, the system is close to the decentralized approaches in AI. These kinds of grammar systems are sometimes called ''colonies'' or ''Eco-Grammar'' systems, depending (besides others) on whether the environment is changing on its own (Eco-Grammar system) or not (colonies).&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

The '''Gregorian Tower''' ({{lang-it|Torre Gregoriana}})  or '''Tower of the Winds''' ({{lang-it|Torre dei Venti}}) is a square tower and [[early modern]] [[observatory]] located above the [[Gallery of Maps]], which connects the Villa Belvedere with the [[Apostolic Palace]]  in [[Vatican City]]. The tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by the [[Bologna|Bolognese]] architect [[Ottaviano Mascherino]] (who was credited with building the Apostolic Palace) mainly to promote the study of [[astronomy]] for the [[Gregorian Calendar]] Reform which was commissioned by Pope [[Gregory XIII]] and promulgated in 1582. It was then also known as the Tower of Winds.&lt;ref name="Michelin2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Manufacture française des pneumatiques Michelin |title=Italia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL-asS2CWsgC&amp;pg=PA323 |date=2007 |publisher=La Guida verde Michelin |isbn=978-2-06-712450-9 |page=323 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tower&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archiviosegretovaticano.va/en/archivio/ambienti/torre-dei-venti/ |title=The Tower of Winds |accessdate=9 May 2013 |publisher=Archivum Secretum Vaticanum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702183252/http://www.archiviosegretovaticano.va/en/archivio/ambienti/torre-dei-venti/ |archivedate=2 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower is now called the "Specola Astronomica Vaticana", the Vatican Observatory.
Four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established. The tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a [[sundial]] as they provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the [[Julian calendar]].

==Early history==
[[File:Gregory XIII.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pope Gregory XIII]] (Pope from 1572 to 1585) who established the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and the Gregorian Tower.]]
The first stage of building of the tower, as recorded by [[Leo XIII]] in his  [[motu proprio]] ''Ut mysticam'' of 1891,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ut Mysticam, Motu proprio circa la rifondazione e l’ampliamento della Specola Vaticana |date=14 March 1891 |url=http://www.disf.org/Documentazione/05-leoneXIII.asp |accessdate=17 May 2013 |author=Pope Leo XIII |authorlink=Pope Leo XIII |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; is credited to Pope [[Gregory XIII]], Pope from 1572 to 1585. The directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the Vatican and equip it with the "greatest and best instruments of the time".&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{CathEncy|author=Hagen, Johann Georg |wstitle=Vatican Observatory|authorlink=Johann Georg Hagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the [[Julian calendar]], in use since 45 BC, to verify their proposed reforms. Fr. [[Christoph Clavius]], a [[Jesuit]] mathematician from the [[Roman College]], was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations. The {{Convert|73|m}} tower was then built above the museum and library, flanked by the Belvedere and della Pigna courtyards. The instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian line]] designed by [[Ignazio Danti]] of [[Perugia]]. It was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre, embellished with scientific designs. The tower still remains today, but has undergone improvements over the centuries.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;

==Second stage==
The second stage of construction in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian, involved Mgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii, a clergyman of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Earlier in 1797, Pius VI gave approval to placing a [[Latin]] inscription ''Specula Vaticana'' at the entrance to the upper part of the tower, which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower's [[observatory]].&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of [[Pope Pius VI]]. Its instrumentation, apart from many normal devices (such as meteorological and magnetic equipment, with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock,&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;) was noted for the Dolland Telescope. The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of [[eclipse]], appearance of [[comets]], [[Satellites of Jupiter]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]’s [[Astronomical transit|transit]]. As an addition, under the patronage of [[Pope Pius X]], four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the {{Convert|1300|ft}} long fortification walls, more than a thousand years old.&lt;ref name="Romero2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Romero, George |title=The Rescue |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHZStF5WgTEC&amp;pg=PA220 |date=18 March 2011 |publisher=George Romero |isbn=978-1-4564-9962-4 |pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mgr. Gilii, highly respected as a [[polyglot]] with a knowledge of physics, biology, archeology and the [[Hebrew language]], was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821. He carried out continuous meteorological observations (twice a day at 6 AM and 2 PM) conforming to the programme of the [[Mannheim Meteorological Society]]. While the observation records for seven years were published, the balance data in a [[manuscript]] form was preserved in the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;&lt;ref name="Romero2011" /&gt; Subsequent to Gilii's death in 1821, the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the [[Roman College]].  Established in 1787, it was considered more suitable for making observations than the Vatican.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;

==Third stage==
The revival of the observatory on the Gregorian Tower was initiated by the [[Barnabite]] [[Francesco Denza]] with the approval of [[Pope Leo XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Francesco Denza|author=Brock, Henry Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; High quality instruments were procured, partly with generous donations from Hicks of [[London]], and the automatic recording instruments were procured from Richard in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=HerbermannPacePallen1913&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herbermann |first=Charles George |last2=Pace |first2=Edward Aloysius |last3=Pallen |first3=Condé Bénoist |first4=Thomas Joseph |last4=Shahan |first5=John Joseph |last5=Wynne |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FEsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA310 |date=1913 |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia Incorporated |p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-inch equatorial, a three-inch transit instrument, and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers, were also procured from the observatory at [[Modena]]. In 1888, the gift of a 16 inch long telescope to [[Pope Leo XIII]], became a part of the observatory.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;&lt;ref name="Romero2011" /&gt; Father Denza joined the observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments. The same year, a second tower was built some {{Convert|400|m}} away from the main Gregorian Tower, overlooking the Vatican Gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on the south-west border. It was built to a diameter of {{Convert|17|m}} with a lower wall thickness of {{Convert|4.5|m}}, which could bear the load of a 13-inch photographic refractor, newly procured from Paris.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; Augustinian Father Rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from 1898 to 1905. In 1891, Pope Leo XIII, promulgating the [[motu proprio]] ''Ut mysticam'', designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established [[Vatican Observatory]], a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ambrosini, Maria Luisa |author2=Willis, Mary |title=The Secret Archives of the Vatican |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Cc9A9_DIQ4C&amp;pg=PA327 |date=19 February 1996 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble, Incorporated |isbn=978-0-7607-0125-6 |pages=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth stage==
The fourth stage involved remedying the problem of communicating between the two towers during the time of [[Pope Pius X]]. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a {{convert|83|m}} iron bridge spanning the gap.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; At the west end of this bridge, a four-inch [[equatorial coordinates|equatorial]] was installed on semicircular bastion. The east end of the bridge, above the barracks of the gendarmes, had a [[heliograph]], with a camera attached, used to photograph the Sun (photoheliograph). A new 16-inch visual [[telescope]], called Torre Pio X, was erected in the second tower.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; As a result of these modifications, the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei, and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the [[Valle di Pompei]] observatory. The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building. The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates. The recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars. Charts were printed on [[silver bromide]] paper.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;

==Features==
The tower had two floors and a [[mezzanine]]. On the first floor was the famous Sundial Room or Meridian Room, which was initially an open [[loggia]]. Pope [[Urban VIII]] had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by [[Simon Lagi]] and the two Flemish artists [[Paul Matthijs|Paul]] and [[Matthijs Bril]]. Today the tower has paintings by [[Cristoforo Roncalli]] and [[Matteino da Siena]].&lt;ref name=Tower /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996" /&gt;

The Sundial Room, also called the Meridian Hall, was once the residence of Queen [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Christina of Sweden]], then newly converted to [[Catholicism]]. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated [[anemoscope]] which was fixed to the ceiling of the Meridian Hall. These were created by [[Ignazio Danti]], the papal [[cosmographer]], in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.&lt;ref name=Tower /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996" /&gt;
The observations made with the sundial provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=Tower /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996" /&gt; The [[anemoscope]], in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at [[Athens]] was also called the [[Tower of the Winds]] and might have been the source for inspiration.&lt;ref name=Tower /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996" /&gt;

The interior walls and ceiling of the hall were richly decorated, in some cases with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the [[Pantheon (gods)|Pantheons]], religious themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.&lt;ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996" /&gt;

'''HNCOCA''' is a 3D [[Triple-resonance nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|triple-resonance]] [[NMR]] experiment commonly used in the field of [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]]. The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an [[Amino acid|amino acid residue]] is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbon of the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary [[HNCA experiment]] transfers magnetization to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the sequence. The HNCOCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]] [[Isotopic labeling|isotopic labelling]], at a concentration greater than 0.1 [[Concentration#Molarity|mM]], and is thus generally only applied to [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant proteins]].

The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N axis and a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)} only, while for the complementary [[HNCA]] experiment peaks appear at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)} and {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; (i)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

[[File:2008-08-22 White German Shepherd swimming in algae.jpg|thumb|A dog swimming through an algal bloom.]]

A '''harmful algal bloom''' ('''HAB''') are organisms that can severely lower oxygen levels in natural waters, killing marine life.  Some HABs are associated with algae-produced toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eutrophication and harmful algal blooms: A scientific consensus|authors=J. Heisler, P.M. Glibert, J.M. Burkholder, D.M. Anderson, W. Cochlan, W.C. Dennison b, Q. Dortch, C.J. Gobler, C.A. Heil, E. Humphries, A. Lewitus, R. Magnien, H.G. Marshallm, K. Sellner, D.A. Stockwell, D.K. Stoecker, M. Suddleson|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=8|issue=1|year=2008|pages=3–13|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2008.08.006|pmid=28781587|pmc=5543702}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blooms can last from a few days to many months. After the bloom dies, the microbes which decompose the dead algae use up even more of the oxygen, which can create [[fish die-off]]s. When these zones of depleted oxygen cover a large area for an extended period of time, they are referred to as [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], where neither fish nor plants are able to survive.
 
HABs are induced by an [[nutrient pollution|overabundance of nutrients]] in the water. The two most common nutrients are fixed nitrogen (nitrates, ammonia, urea) and phosphate.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/habs/general.html Harmful Algal Blooms], ''Center for Disease Control''&lt;/ref&gt;  These nutrients are emitted by [[Agricultural pollution|agriculture]], other industries, excessive [[fertilizer]] use in urban/suburban areas and associated [[urban runoff]]. Higher water temperature and low circulation are contributing factors. HABs can cause significant harm to animals, the environment and economies. They have been increasing in size and frequency worldwide, a fact that many experts attribute to global climate change. The U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) predicts more harmful blooms in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Chelsea |date=2016-09-29 |title=The Pacific blob caused an "unprecedented" toxic algal bloom — and there’s more to come |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/29/warm-oceans-caused-last-years-toxic-blob-and-more-algae-blooms-may-be-in-store |work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and identification==
[[File:Banter See 1348.jpg|thumb|px240|Algae on the coast of northern Germany]]
HABs from [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) can appear as a foam, scum, or mat on or just below the surface of water and can take on various colors depending on their pigments.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater lakes or rivers may appear bright green, often with surface streaks which looks like floating paint.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Similarly, red tides made up of dinoflagellates, also contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from green to brown to red.

Most blooms occur in warm waters that have excessive nutrients.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The harmful effects from such blooms is due to the toxins they produce or from using up oxygen in the water which can lead to fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/07/algae-blooms-economy-west-coast-toxic-bloom/31222581/ "What you need to know about toxic algae blooms"], ''USA Today'', August 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all algal blooms are harmful, however, with some only discoloring water, producing a smelly odor, or adding a bad taste to the water. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell if a bloom is harmful from just appearances, since sampling and microscopic examination is required.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Blue-gree algae bloom Lake Erie.png|thumb|px240|Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) bloom on [[Lake Erie]] in 2009]]
There are three main types of algae which can form into harmful algal blooms: [[cyanobacteria]], [[dinoflagellates]] and [[diatoms]]. All three are made up of microscopic floating organisms which, like plants, can create their own food from sunlight by means of [[photosynthesis]]. That ability makes them an essential part of the [[food web]] for small fish and other organisms.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black, Jacquelyn G., and Black, Laura J. ''Microbiology: Principles and Explorations'', 8th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Cyanobacteria===
Harmful algal blooms in freshwater lakes and rivers, or at [[estuaries]], where rivers flow into the ocean, are caused by cyanobacteria, also known as "blue-green algae".&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;Peebles, Ernst B. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-us/why-toxic-algae-blooms-li_b_11082734.html "Why toxic algae blooms like Florida’s are so dangerous to people and wildlife"], ''Huffington Post'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; They can produce hazardous toxins, such as [[microcystins]],&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; a [[neurotoxin]] which destroys nerve tissue of mammals.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; In high enough concentrations, water treatment plants may be unable to remove the toxin and will advise residents to avoid drinking tap water, as happened in Toledo, Ohio in August 2014.&lt;ref name=Toledo/&gt;

They also cause harm by blocking the sunlight or by using up the oxygen needed by fish or plant life, which can lead to fish die-offs.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;  When such oxygen-depleted water covers a large area for an extended period of time, it can become [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]], commonly called a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]. These dead zones can be the result of numerous different factors ranging from natural phenomenon to deliberate human interaction. These dead zones are not just limited to large bodies of fresh water as found in the great lakes, but are also prone to bodies of salt water as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html|title='Dead zone' is a more common term for hypoxia, which refers to a reduced level of oxygen in the water|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red tides===
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|px240|A red tide off the coast of [[San Diego, California]]]]
{{main|Red tide}}

The other types of algae are [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s, found primarily in marine environments, such as ocean coastlines or bays, where they can also form algal blooms, commonly called [[red tide]]s. Red tides, however, may be a natural phenomenon,&lt;ref name=Red&gt;[http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml FAQs about red tides], Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department&lt;/ref&gt; although when they form close to coastlines or in estuaries. They can occur when warmer water, salinity, and nutrients reach certain levels, which then stimulates their growth.&lt;ref name=Red/&gt; Most red tide algae are dinoflagellates.&lt;ref name=monterey&gt;Ryan, John. [http://montereybay.noaa.gov/sac/2008/081508/081508ryan_ppt.pdf "Red Tide &amp; HAB Studies in Monterey Bay"], Monterey Bay Sanctuary Advisory Council Meeting, August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They are visible in water at a concentration of 1,000 algae cells per milliliter, while in dense blooms they can measure over 200,000 per milliliter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150901144353.htm "Intense, widespread algal blooms reported in Chesapeake Bay"], ''Science Daily'', Sept. 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Diatoms produce [[domoic acid]], another neurotoxin, which can cause seizures in higher vertebrates and birds as it concentrates up the food chain.&lt;ref name=marine&gt;[http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/science/top-research-projects/domoic-acid-toxicity.html "Domoic Acid Toxicity"], ''The Marine Mammal Center''&lt;/ref&gt; Domoic acid readily accumulates in the bodies of [[shellfish]], [[sardines]], and [[anchovies]], which if then eaten by [[sea lions]], [[otters]], [[cetaceans]],  birds or people, can affect the nervous system causing serious injury or death.&lt;ref name=marine/&gt; In the summer of 2015, the state governments closed important shellfish fisheries in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] because of high concentrations of domoic acid in shellfish.&lt;ref name=shellfish&gt;[https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/news/features/west_coast_algal_bloom/index.cfm "NOAA Fisheries mobilizes to gauge unprecedented West Coast toxic algal bloom"], Northwest Fisheries Science Center, June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Among the causes of algal blooms are:
* chemical wastes, primarily nutrients—[[phosphorus]] and [[nitrates]]—from fertilizers or human waste,&lt;ref name="EPA-Climate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms |title=Climate Change and Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-09 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peebles/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Amin |first=Md Nurul |last2=Kroeze |first2=Carolien |last3=Strokal |first3=Maryna |date=2017 |title=Human waste: An underestimated source of nutrient pollution in coastal seas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025326X17301595 |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1-2 |pages=131–140 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.045 |issn=0025-326X |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* climate change with its resultant [[global warming]],&lt;ref name="EPA-Climate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;
* [[thermal pollution]] from power plants and factories, and
* low water levels in inland waterways and lakes, which reduces water flow and increases water temperatures.&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;[http://kutv.com/news/local/neurotoxic-algae-bloom-shuts-down-utah-lake "Neurotoxic algae bloom that shuts down Utah Lake can affect brain, liver"], ''KUTV'', July 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Russian&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5741904-181/russian-river-to-be-closely?artslide=0 "Russian River to be closely monitored this summer to guard against harmful algae blooms"], ''Press Democrat'', June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change, according to NOAA scientists, contributes to warmer waters which makes conditions more favorable for algae growth in more regions and farther north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/algal-blooms-likely-to-flourish-as-temperatures-climb "Algal blooms 'likely to flourish as temperatures climb'"], ''Straits Times'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Global warming is also considered a key factor for algal blooms in the Southern hemisphere, acknowledged by scientists in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sentinelsource.com/features/environment/the-disgusting-uptick-in-the-incidence-of-algae-blooms/article_147ea74e-d028-5191-88e9-c21d02bb7f95.html "The disgusting uptick in the incidence of algae blooms"], ''Washington Post'', August 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In general, still, warm, shallow water, combined with high-nutrient conditions in lakes or rivers, increases the risk of harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Russian/&gt;

===Examples===
====Texas==== 
Natural water reservoirs in [[Texas]] have been threatened by anthropogenic activities due to large petroleum refineries and oil wells (i.e. emission and wastewater discharge), massive agricultural activities (i.e. pesticide release) and mining extractions (i.e. toxic wastewater) as well as natural phe-nomena involving frequent HABs events. For the first time in 1985, the state of Texas documented the presence of the ''p. parvum'' (golden alga) bloom along the [[Pecos River]]. This phenomenon has affected 33 reservoirs in Texas along major river systems, including the Brazos, Canadian, Rio Grande, Colorado, and Red River, and has resulted in the death of more than 27 million fish and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sharifan |first=Hamidreza |last2=Ma |first2=Xingmao |date=2017-08-31 |title=Potential Photochemical Interactions of UV Filter Molecules with Multichlorinated Structure of Prymnesins in Harmful Algal Bloom Events |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/152553/article |journal=Mini-Reviews in Organic Chemistry |volume=14 |issue=5 |doi=10.2174/1570193x14666170518124658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chesapeake Bay====
[[File:July 12, 2013 - Sassafras River, VA Algal Bloom (9321804011).jpg|thumb|An algal bloom on the [[Sassafras River]], a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay]]
The [[Chesapeake Bay]], the largest [[estuary]] in the U.S., has suffered from repeated large algal blooms for decades due to chemical runoff from multiple sources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-algae-blooms-20150508-story.html "Scientists eye increase in harmful algae in Chesapeake"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', May 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; including 9 large rivers and 141 smaller streams and creeks in parts of six states. In addition, the water is quite shallow and only 1% of the waste entering it gets flushed into the ocean.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

By weight, 60% of the phosphates entering the bay in 2003 were from sewage treatment plants, while 60% of its nitrates came from fertilizer runoff, farm animal waste, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; About 300 million pounds (140 Gg) of nitrates are added to the bay each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/issues/dead-zones/nitrogen-phosphorus "Too Much Nitrogen and Phosphorus Are Bad for the Bay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728141032/http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/issues/dead-zones/nitrogen-phosphorus |date=2016-07-28 }}, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The population increase in the bay [[drainage basin|watershed]], from 3.7 million people in 1940 to 18 million in 2015 is also a major factor,&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; as economic growth leads to the increased use of fertilizers and rising emissions of industrial waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-nitrogen-pollution-accompanies-chinas-growth/ "Massive Nitrogen Pollution Accompanies China's Growth"], ''Scientific American'', Feb. 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e360.yale.edu/feature/on_lake_taihu_china_moves_to_battle_massive_algae_blooms/2429/  "On Lake Taihu, China Moves To Battle Massive Algae Blooms"], ''Environment 360'', Yale University, July 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the six states and the local governments in the Chesapeake watershed have upgraded their sewage treatment plants to control nutrient discharges. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that sewage treatment plant improvements in the Chesapeake region between 1985 and 2015 have prevented the discharge of 900 million pounds (410 Gg) of nutrients, with nitrogen discharges reduced by 57% and phosphorus by 75%.&lt;ref name="EPA-Chesapeake Pollution"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/wastewater-pollution-reduction-chesapeake-bay-watershed |title=Wastewater Pollution Reduction in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-07-27 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural and urban runoff pollution continue to be major sources of nutrients in the bay, and efforts to manage those problems are continuing throughout the {{convert|64000|sqmi|km2}} watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/chesapeake-bay-tmdl-fact-sheet |title=Chesapeake Bay TMDL Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-09-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lake Erie====
Recent algae blooms in Lake Erie have been fed primarily by agricultural runoff and have led to warnings for some people in Canada and Ohio not to drink their water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/08/toledo_water_crisis_must_spark.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2014/10/toxic_lake_erie_algal_blooms_r.html&lt;/ref&gt; The International Joint Commission has called on United States and Canada to drastically reduce phosphorus loads into Lake Erie to address the threat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijc.org/en_/leep/report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.circleofblue.org/2014/world/joint-u-s-canada-agency-calls-big-phosphorus-reductions-lake-erie/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Okeechobee Waterway ====
[[File:Cropped lake okeechobee oli 2016184 lrg.jpg|thumb|2016 [[NASA]] imagery showing an [[algal bloom]] on [[Lake Okeechobee]]. ]]
[[Lake Okeechobee]] is an ideal habitat for cyanobacteria because it's shallow, sunny, and laden with nutrients from Florida's agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havens|first=Karl|last2=Li|first2=Bai-Lian|last3=Philips|first3=Edward|date=May 1998|title=Light availability as a possible regulator of cyanobacteria species composition in a shallow subtropical lake|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward_Phlips/publication/249440655_Light_availability_as_a_possible_regulator_of_cyanobacteria_species_composition_in_a_shallow_subtropical_lake/links/59dcace1aca2728e201f979d/Light-availability-as-a-possible-regulator-of-cyanobacteria-species-composition-in-a-shallow-subtropical-lake.pdf|journal=Freshwater Biology|volume=39|pages=547-556|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Okeechobee Waterway]] connects the lake to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] through the [[St. Lucie River]] and the [[Caloosahatchee River|Caloosahatchee]] respectively. This means that harmful algal blooms are carried down the estuaries as water is released during the wet summer months. In July 2018 up to 90% of Lake Okeechobee was covered in algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/algae-blooms-florida-nyt.html|title=Algae bloom in florida prompts fears about harm to health and economy|last=Gomez|first=Melissa|date=9 July 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water draining from the lake filled the region with a noxious odor and caused respiratory problems in some humans during the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/harmful-algal-blooms-linger-parts-southern-florida-july-and-august-2018|title=Harmful algal blooms linger in parts of southern Florida in July and August 2018|last=Di Liberto|first=Tom|date=16 August 2018|website=NOAA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters worse, harmful red tide blooms are historically common on Florida's coasts during these same summer months.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=Frank|date=August 2007|title=An assessment of Florida red tide: causes, consequences, and management strategies.|url=https://dspace.mote.org/bitstream/2075/2911/1/Alcock-MPI_RedTide.pdf|journal=Mote Marine Technical Report|volume=1190|pages=|via=Mote Marine Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria in the rivers die as they reach saltwater but their nitrogen fixation feeds the red tide on the coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Areas at the mouth of the estuaries such as [[Cape Coral, Florida|Cape Coral]] and [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] therefore experience the compounded effects of both types of harmful algal bloom. Cleanup crews hired by authorities in [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] - where the Caloosahatchee meets the Gulf of Mexico - removed more than 1700 tons of dead marine life in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/us/red-tide-fishkill-costs-trnd/index.html|title=Florida's red tide has produced 2,000 tons of dead marine life and cost businesses more than $8 million|last=Murphy|first=Paul|date=23 August 2018|work=CNN|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Coastal seas of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan====
[[Open defecation]] is common in south Asia, but human waste is an often overlooked source of nutrient pollution in marine pollution modeling. When nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contributed by human waste was included in models for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, the estimated N and P inputs to bodies of water increased one to two orders of magnitude compared to previous models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; River export of nutrients to coastal seas increases coastal [[eutrophication]] potential (ICEP). The ICEP of the [[Godavari River]] is three times higher when N and P inputs from human waste are included.

==Harmful effects==
As algal blooms grow, they deplete the oxygen in the water and block sunlight from reaching fish and plants. Such blooms can last from a few days to many months.&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt; With less light, plants beneath the bloom can die and fish can starve.Furthermore, the dense population of a bloom reduces oxygen saturation during the night by respiration.  And when the algae eventually die off, the microbes which decompose the dead algae use up even more oxygen, which in turn causes more fish to die or leave the area. When oxygen continues to be depleted by blooms it can lead to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], where neither fish nor plants are able to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/926 "Spreading Dead Zones and Consequences for Marine Ecosystems"], ''Science'', August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These dead zones in the case of the Chesapeake Bay, where they are a normal occurrence, are also suspected of being a major source of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dietrich |first=Tamara |date=2016-07-19 |title=Study: Chesapeake Bay a bigger methane generator than previously thought |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/science/dp-nws-chesapeake-bay-methane-20160719-story.html |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative impact on fish can be even more severe when they are confined to pens, as they are in fish farms. In 2007 a fish farm in [[British Columbia]] lost 260 tons of salmon as a result of blooms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmedanddangerous.org/salmon-farming-problems/environmental-impacts/algae-blooms/ Algae Blooms in fish farming], Farmed and Dangerous.org&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 a farm in Chile lost 23 million salmon after an algal bloom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/10/3758642/chile-algal-bloom-salmon/ "One Of The U.S.’s Top Salmon Providers Just Lost Millions Of Salmon"], ''Climate Progress'', March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NOAA, less than one percent of algal blooms produce hazardous toxins, such as [[microcystins]].&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/habharm.html "Are all algal blooms harmful?"], ''NOAA'', April 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although blue-green or other algae do not usually pose a direct threat to health, the [[toxins]] (poisons) which they produce are considered dangerous to humans, land animals, sea mammals,  birds&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt; and fish when the toxins are ingested.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; The toxins are [[neurotoxins]] which destroy nerve tissue which can affect the nervous system, brain, and liver, and can lead to death.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Tests have shown some toxins near blooms can be in the air and thereby be inhaled, which could affect health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://weather.com/science/environment/news/florida-martin-county-algae-toxic-air-particles-marina-rio "Tests Reveal Florida's Toxic Algae is Threatening Not Only The Water Quality but Also the Air"], ''Weather.com'', July 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no treatment available for animals, including livestock cattle, if they drink from algal blooms where such toxins are present. The Florida Department of Health recommends that people and pets be kept away from algal blooms to avoid contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marysvilleonline.net/news/article_49f895a6-4932-11e6-84b9-87884f9cfc1a.html?mode=print "Blue algae problems persist"], ''Marysville Online'', July 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural officials in [[Utah]] worried that even crops could become contaminated if irrigated with toxic water, although they admit that they can't measure contamination accurately because of so many variables in farming. They issued warnings to residents, however, out of caution.&lt;ref name=KSL&gt;[https://www.ksl.com/?sid=40725118&amp;nid=148 "Effects of algal blooms continue to spread throughout Wasatch Front"], ''KSL TV'', July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drinking water====
[[File:Toxic Algae Bloom in Lake Erie.jpg|thumb|px240|Satellite image of Lake Erie during an algal bloom in 2011]]
Persons are generally warned not to enter or drink water from algal blooms, or let their pets swim in the water since many pets have died from algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Russian/&gt; In at least one case, people began getting sick before warnings were issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgvtribune.com/environment-and-nature/20160718/people-got-sick-at-pyramid-lake-before-the-state-reported-toxic-algae-bloom-could-it-have-been-avoided "People got sick at Pyramid Lake before the state reported toxic algae bloom.

Alan Steinman of [[Grand Valley State University]] has explained that among the major causes for the algal blooms in general, and Lake Erie specifically, is because blue-green algae thrive with high nutrients, along with warm and calm water. Lake Erie is more prone to blooms because it has a high nutrient level and is shallow, which causes it to warm up more quickly during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Video interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2PsjhiZl2Q&amp;t=38s Dr. Alan Steinman on Algal Blooms in Lake Erie] 13 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms from drinking toxic water can show up within a few hours after exposure. They can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, or trigger headaches and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Although rare, liver toxicity can cause death.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Those symptoms can then lead to dehydration, another major concern. In high concentrations, the toxins in the algal waters when simply touched can cause skin rashes, irritate the eyes, nose, mouth or throat.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Those with suspected symptoms are told to call a doctor if symptoms persist or they can't hold down fluids after 24 hours.

The hazards which accompany harmful algal blooms have hindered visitors' enjoyment of beaches and lakes in places in the U.S. such as Florida,&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;[http://wlrn.org/post/summer-heat-could-worsen-algae-blooms-florida-waters "Summer Heat Could Worsen Algae Blooms In Florida Waters"], ''WLRN'', July 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref name=California&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-pyramid-lake-algae-bloom-20160714-snap-story.html "Summer conditions growing toxic algae blooms in two California lakes"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Vermont,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Vt-Beaches-Reopen-After-Algae-Blooms-Clear-386953991.html "Vt. Beaches Reopen After Algae Blooms Clear"], ''NECN'', July 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and Utah.&lt;ref name="Utah2" /&gt; Persons hoping to enjoy their vacations or days off have been kept away to the detriment of local economies. Lakes and rivers in [[North Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], Utah, California and Ohio have had signs posted warning about the potential of health risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/environment/2016/07/22/algae-blooming-waterways-all-around-country/87262178/ "Algae is blooming in waterways all around the country"], ''Florida Today'', July 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 [[Florida]] declared a [[state of emergency]] for four counties as a result of blooms. They were said to be "destroying" a number of businesses and affecting local economies, with many needing to shut down entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/25512/20160719/look-florida-toxic-algae-choking-economy-environment.htm "How Florida's Toxic Algae is Choking the Economy And The Environment"], ''Nature World News'', July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Some beaches were closed, and hotels and restaurants suffered a drop in business. Tourist sporting activities such as fishing and boating were also affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/florida-tourism-not-seeing-green-toxic-algae-chokes-business-n607106 "Florida Tourism Not Seeing Green as Toxic Algae Chokes Business"], ''NBC News'', July 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida2&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/05/toxic-algae-driving-away-florida-beachgoers.html "Toxic algae driving away Florida beachgoers"], ''CNBC'', July 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Marco Rubio]] called the situation in Florida "a health, ecological and economic emergency."&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-algal-blooms_us_577d70cee4b0c590f7e7e3d2 "Toxic Algal Blooms Aren’t Just Florida’s Problem.

Similar blooms have become more common in Europe, with France among the countries reporting them. In the summer of 2009, beaches in northern [[Brittany]] became covered by tonnes of potentially lethal rotting green algae. A horse being ridden along the beach collapsed and died from fumes given off by the rotting algae.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/france-brittany-coast-seaweed-algae "Lethal algae take over beaches in northern France"], ''The Guardian'', U.K., August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic damage resulting from lost business has become a serious concern. According to one report in 2016, the four main economic impacts from harmful algal blooms come from damage to human health, fisheries, tourism and recreation, and the cost of monitoring and management of area where blooms appear.&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt; EPA estimates that algal blooms impact 65 percent of the country's major estuaries, with an annual cost of $2.2 billion.&lt;ref name=KSL/&gt; In the U.S. there are an estimated 166 coastal dead zones.&lt;ref name=KSL/&gt; Because data collection has been more difficult and limited from sources outside the U.S., most of the estimates as of 2016 have been primarily for the U.S.&lt;ref name=JRC&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/algal-bloom-and-its-economic-impact "Algal bloom and its economic impact"], ''European Commission Joint Research Centre'', 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In port cities in the [[Shandong Province]] of eastern China, residents are no longer surprised when massive algal blooms arrive each year and inundate beaches. Prior to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, over 10,000 people worked to clear 20,000 tons of dead algae from beaches.&lt;ref name=China&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-yellow-sea-turns-green-qingdao-beaches-are-covered-algae-photos-1509734 "China: Yellow Sea turns green as Qingdao beaches are covered in algae"], ''International Business Times'', July 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 another bloom in China, thought to be its largest ever,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-china-largest-ever-algae-bloom.html "China hit by largest-ever algae bloom"], ''Phys.org'', July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; covered an area of 7,500 square miles,&lt;ref name=China/&gt; and was followed by another in 2015 which blanketed an even greater 13,500 square miles. The blooms in China are thought to be caused by pollution from untreated agricultural and industrial discharges into rivers leading to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/china-has-an-algae-beach-pollution-problem-2015-7?r=UK&amp;IR=T "Slimy green algae is taking over China's beaches for an alarming reason"], ''Business Insider'', July 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fisheries industry====
[[File:NOAA Pacific coast 2015.jpg|thumb|px240|West coast algal bloom of 2015 which led to closing of fisheries]]
As early as 1976 a short-term, relatively small, dead zone off the coasts of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] cost commercial and recreational fisheries over $500 million.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt; In 1998 a red tide in Hong Kong killed over $10 million in high-value fish.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

In 2009, the economic impact for the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington's]] coastal counties dependent on its fishing industry was estimated to be $22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miner |first=Colin |date=2009-11-27 |title=Assessing Algal Blooms’ Economic Impact |url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/assessing-algal-blooms-economic-impact/ |work=New York Times |series=Green: Energy, the Environment and the Bottom Line (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the U.S. seafood industry expected future lost revenue could amount to $900 million annually.&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt;

NOAA has provided a few cost estimates for various blooms over the past few years:&lt;ref name=NOAA3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaa.gov/what-is-harmful-algal-bloom |title=What is a harmful algal bloom? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-04-27 |website= |publisher=U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; $10.3 million in 2011 due to the red tide at Texas oyster landings; $2.4 million lost income by tribal commerce from 2015 fishery closures in the pacific northwest; $40 million from Washington state's loss of tourism from the same fishery closure.

Along with damage to businesses, the toll from human sickness results in lost wages and damaged health. The costs of medical treatment, investigation by health agencies through water sampling and testing, and the posting of warning signs at effected locations is also costly.&lt;ref name=WHOI&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=24159&amp;pt=10&amp;p=19132 "Estimated Annual Economic Impacts from Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the United States"], Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The closures applied to areas where this algae bloom occurs has a big negative impact of the fishing industries, add to that the high fish mortality that follows, the increase in price due to the shortage of fish available and decrease in the demand for seafood due to the fear of contamination by toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Algae bloom and its economic impact |last=Sanseverino |first=Isabella |publisher=JRC publications |year=2016 |isbn=978-92-79-58101-4 |location=Europe |pages=23, 26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes a big economic loss for the industry.

Economic costs are estimated to rise. In June 2015, for instance, the largest known toxic HAB forced the shutdown of the west coast shellfish industry, the first time that has ever happened. One Seattle NOAA expert commented, "This is unprecedented in terms of the extent and magnitude of this harmful algal bloom and the warm water conditions we're seeing offshore...."&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/06/west_coast_shellfish_industrie.html "Biggest-ever toxic algal bloom hits West Coast, shutting down shellfish industries"], ''Oregon Live'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The bloom covered a range from [[Santa Barbara, California]] northward to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/toxic-algae-bloom-in-pacific-ocean-could-be-largest-ever/ "Toxic algae bloom in Pacific Ocean could be largest ever"], ''CBS News'', June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[Ohio River]] had a bloom which stretched an "unprecedented" {{convert|650|mi|km}} into adjoining states and tested positive for toxins, which created drinking water and recreation problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/10/03/algae-along-the-ohio.html "Toxic algae bloom now stretches 650 miles along Ohio river"], ''The Columbus Dispatch'', Oct. 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of Utah's [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]] was closed due to toxic algal bloom in 2016.&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt;

Researchers have reported the growth of HABs in Europe, Africa and Australia. Those have included blooms on some of the [[African Great Lakes]], such as [[Lake Victoria]], the second largest freshwater lake in the world.&lt;ref name=Circle/&gt; [[India]] has been reporting an increase in the number of blooms each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/boom-in-harmful-algal-blooms/article963739.ece "Boom in harmful algal blooms"], ''The Hindu'', Dec 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 [[Hong Kong]] reported its first red tide.

''Vital Signs 1999–2000: The Environmental Trends that Are Shaping Our Future'', Routledge (1999 pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there have been reports of harmful algal blooms throughout popular Canadian lakes such as Beaver Lake and Quamichan Lake. These blooms were responsible for the deaths of a few animals and led to swimming advisories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/blue-green-algae-beaver-lake-1.4214729|title=Toxic blue-green algae ends swimming at popular Victoria lake|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global warming and pollution is causing algal blooms to form in places previously considered "impossible" or rare for them to exist, such as under the ice sheets in the [[Arctic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/arctic-algal-blooms-060712.html "NASA mission, led by Stanford biologist, finds massive algal blooms under Arctic sea ice"], ''Stanford News'', June 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/18915-antarctic-algae-bloom-nasa.html "Behemoth Antarctic Algae Bloom Seen from Space"], ''Life Science'', March 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Himalayan Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/pollution-neglect-and-too-much-love-killing-once-idyllic-himalayan-lake-20111104-1mzw0.html "Pollution, neglect and too much love killing once idyllic Himalayan lake"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', Nov. 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rocky Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://jordanramis.com/water-law-blog/addressing-algal-blooms-in-rocky-mountain-national-park/ "Addressing Algal Blooms in Rocky Mountain National Park"], Jordan Ramis, August 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/emergency/wilderness/Sierra_Algae-pdf10-14-09.pdf " Algae in Sierra Nevada Mountain Wilderness Areas: Potential Health Hazards"], ''Journal of Mountain Medicine and Ecology'', University of California, Davis, Fall 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fish die-offs====
[[File:Atibaia 2014-02-19 - Seca no Rio Atibaia (3) (13587504875).jpg|thumb|px240|Massive fish die-off in Brazil]]
Massive fish die-offs have been caused by HABs.&lt;ref name=WHOI-2&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/science/B/redtide/foodweb/fishkills.html "Fish Kills due to Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 23 million salmon which were being farmed in Chile died from a toxic algae bloom.&lt;ref name=salmon&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/23-million-salmon-dead-due-to-toxic-algal-bloom-in-chile-1882188276.html "23 Million Salmon Dead Due to Toxic Algal Bloom in Chile"], ''EcoWatch'', March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; To get rid of the dead fish, the ones fit for consumption were made into fishmeal and the rest were dumped 60 miles offshore to avoid risks to human health.&lt;ref name=salmon/&gt; The economic cost of that die-off is estimated to have been $800 million.&lt;ref name=salmon/&gt; Environmental expert [[Lester Brown]] has written that the farming of salmon and shrimp in offshore ponds concentrates waste, which contributes to [[eutrophication]] and the creation of dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. [http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_files/pb4book.pdf ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''], Earth Policy Institute, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have reported similar impacts, with cities such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil seeing major fish die-offs from blooms becoming a common occurrence.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/21/brazil-removes-50-tons-of-dead-fish-from-olympic-waters.html "Brazil removes 50 tons of dead fish from Olympic waters"], ''Aljazeera'', April 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Rio collected an estimated 50 tons of dead fish from the lagoon where water events in the 2016 Olympics were planned to take place.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;

The [[Monterey Bay]] has suffered from harmful algal blooms, most recently in 2015: "Periodic blooms of toxin-producing ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'' diatoms have been documented for over 25 years in Monterey Bay and elsewhere along the U.S. west coast. During large blooms, the [[Bioaccumulation|toxin accumulates]] in shellfish and small fish such as anchovies and sardines that feed on algae, forcing the closure of some fisheries and poisoning marine mammals and birds that feed on contaminated fish."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stephens, [http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/algal-bloom.html Large bloom of toxic algae under way in Monterey Bay and beyond], [[UC Santa Cruz]] (June 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar fish die-offs from toxic algae or lack of oxygen have been seen in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsobitie.com.ua%2Fnovosti%2Fv-kamenskom-mestnye-vlasti-nanyali-podryadchikov-ubirat-gory-mertvoy-ryby-s-plyazhey&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Kamensk local authorities have hired contractors to clean up mountains of dead fish from the beaches"], July 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wradio.com.co%2Fnoticias%2Fregionales%2Freportan-mortandad-de-peces-en-los-palafitos%2F20160717%2Fnota%2F3191232.aspx&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Fish kills reported in the Palafitos"], W Radio, July 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/society/160721/thanh-hoa--locals-wear-masks-as-smell-from-dead-fish-overpowering.html "Thanh Hoa: Locals wear masks as smell from dead fish overpowering"], Vietnam.net, July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; China,&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fjs.ifeng.com%2Fa%2F20160706%2F4725768_0.shtml&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Hongze Lake Suqian great, full of dead fish breeding area"], Modern Express Network, July 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/tens-of-thousands-of-fish-dead-in-quebec-s-yamaska-river/article/469215 "Massive fish kill in Quebec's Yamaska River puzzle scientists"], ''Digital Journal'', July 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/scores-of-starfish-wash-ashore-in-turkeys-northwest.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=101009&amp;NewsCatID=341 "Scores of starfish wash ashore in Turkey’s northwest"], ''Hurriyet Daily News'', June 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radarcirebon.com/90-ton-ikan-waduk-darma-mati-masal-ini-penyebabnya.html "90 Tons of Fish Die Darma Masal"], Radar Cirebon, June 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.francetvinfo.fr%2Fmeteo%2Fmaine-et-loire-des-milliers-de-poissons-asphyxies-avec-la-decrue_1506061.html%23xtor%3DAL-67-&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Maine-et-Loire: Thousands of fish suffocated with the decline"], ''France TV'', June 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land animal deaths====
Land animals, including livestock and pets have been affected. Dogs have died from the toxins after swimming in algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/02/02/3617937/california-algae-bloom/ "Unseasonal Toxic Algae Bloom In California Lake Kills Three Dogs"], ''Climate Progress'', Feb. 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Warnings have come from government agencies in the state of Ohio, which noted that many dogs and livestock deaths resulted from HAB exposure in the U.S. and other countries.

Birds have died after eating dead fish contaminated with toxic algae. Rotting and decaying fish are eaten by birds such as [[pelicans]], [[seagulls]], [[cormorant]]s, and possibly marine or land mammals, which then become poisoned.&lt;ref name=WHOI-2/&gt; The nervous systems of dead birds were examined and had failed from the toxin's effect.&lt;ref name=KSBW/&gt; On the Oregon and Washington coast, a thousand [[scoter]]s, or sea ducks, were also killed in 2009.

It has even been suggested that harmful algal blooms are responsible for the deaths of animals found in fossil troves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gramling C. |year=2017 |title=Toxic algae may be culprit in mysterious dinosaur deaths |journal=Science |volume=357 |issue=6354 |page=857 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6354/857.1 |pmid=28860363 |doi=10.1126/science.357.6354.857-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====More dead zones====
[[File:Gulf dead zone.jpg|thumb|px240|Dead zone in the southern U.S.]]
According to NOAA, blooms can harm the environment even without producing toxins by depleting oxygen from the water when growing and while decaying after they die. Blooms can also block sunlight to organisms living beneath it. A record-breaking number and size of blooms have formed in the Pacific coast, in Lake Erie, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the Gulf of Mexico, where a number of dead zones were created as a result.&lt;ref name=Huffington/&gt; In the 1960s the number of dead zones worldwide was 49; the number rose to over 400 by 2008.&lt;ref name=SciAm2&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oceanic-dead-zones-spread/ "Oceanic Dead Zones Continue to Spread"], ''Scientific American'', August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. they are especially prevalent along the east and south coasts.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

Various important natural habitats such as rivers, lakes and [[estuaries]] have continued to degrade and has contributed to creating more oxygen-deprived [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], including some in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/49347-lake-erie-dead-zone-drought.html "Lake Erie Dead Zone: Don't Blame the Slime!"], ''Live Science'', January 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Circle2&gt;Kozacek, Codi. [http://www.circleofblue.org/2016/united-states/algal-blooms-no-accident-florida-everglades-estuaries/ "Algal Blooms Are No Accident For Florida Everglades and Estuaries"], ''Circle of Blue'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;	

Among the largest dead zones were those in northern Europe’s [[Baltic Sea]] and the Gulf of Mexico, which affects a $2.8 billion U.S. fish industry.&lt;ref name=Circle/&gt; Unfortunately, dead zones rarely recover and usually grow in size.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt; One of the few dead zones to ever recover was in the [[Black Sea]], which returned to normal fairly quickly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s due to a resulting reduction in fertilizer use.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

==Potential remedies==
===Chemical treatment and dams===
Although a number of [[algaecide]]s have been effective in killing algae, they have been used mostly in small bodies of water. For large algal blooms, however, adding algaecides such as silver nitrate or copper sulfate can have worse effects, such as killing fish outright and harming other wildlife.&lt;ref name=Greensburg&gt;[http://www.greensburgdailynews.com/news/local_news/what-is-creeping-into-our-lakes/article_d77a16fa-ef97-5f5c-bb18-ae7b1acca0fa.html "What is creeping into our lakes?"], ''Greensburg Daily News'', August 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects can therefore be worse than letting the algae die off naturally.&lt;ref name=Greensburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSU/&gt;

Other experts have proposed building reservoirs to prevent the movement of algae downstream. However, that can lead to the growth of algae within the reservoir, which become sediment traps with a resultant buildup of nutrients.&lt;ref name=Greensburg/&gt; Some researchers found that intensive blooms in reservoirs were the primary source of toxic algae observed downstream, but the movement of algae has so far been less studied, although it is considered a likely cause of algae transport.&lt;ref name=OSU&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2015/jun/toxic-algal-blooms-behind-klamath-river-dams-create-health-risks-far-downstream "Toxic algal blooms behind Klamath River dams create health risks far downstream"], ''Oregon State University News'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/control-and-treatment |title=Control and Treatment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-02 |website=Nutrient Policy and Data |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensors and monitoring devices===
A growing number of scientists agree that there is an urgent need to protect the public by being able to forecast harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Richtel |first=Matt |date=2016-07-18 |title=A Dreaded Forecast for Our Times: Algae, and Lots of It |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/science/a-dreaded-forecast-for-our-times-algae-and-lots-of-it.html?_r=1 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way they hope to do that is with sophisticated sensors which can help warn about potential blooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a206/ "Keeping Tabs on HABs: New Tools for Detecting, Monitoring, and Preventing Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', August 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The same types of sensors can also be used by water treatment facilities to help them prepare for higher toxic levels.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a206/ "Keeping Tabs on HABs: New Tools for Detecting, Monitoring, and Preventing Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sensors now in use are located in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008 similar sensors in the Gulf forewarned of an increased level of toxins which led to a shutdown of shellfish harvesting in Texas along with a recall of mussels, clams and oysters, possibly saving many lives. With an increase in the size and frequency of HABs, experts state the need for significantly more sensors located around the country.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt; The same kinds of sensors can also be used to detect threats to drinking water from intentional contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/homeland-security-research/water-system-security-and-resilience-homeland-security-research |title=Water System Security and Resilience in Homeland Security Research |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four U.S. federal agencies—EPA, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), NOAA, and the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS)—are working on ways to detect and measure cyanobacteria blooms using satellite data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algaeindustrymagazine.com/us-agencies-creating-algal-bloom-early-warning-system/ "US agencies creating algal bloom early warning system"], ''Algae Industry Magazine'', April 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The data may help develop early-warning indicators of cyanobacteria blooms by monitoring both local and national coverage.&lt;ref name=satellite&gt;[http://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/2015-12-21-cyanobacteria_sensing.html "Remote Sensing Provides a National View of Cyanobacteria Blooms"], USGS&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 automated early-warning monitoring systems were successfully tested, and for the first time proven to identify the rapid growth of algae and the subsequent depletion of oxygen in the water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news.virginia.edu/content/scientists-develop-early-warning-system-toxic-algae-blooms "Scientists Develop Early-Warning System for Toxic Algae Blooms"], ''UVA Today'', Univ. of Virginia, Jan. 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the U.S. at least, funding for such warning devices has been shrinking, with approved funding down 45% over the last five years.{{When|date=August 2018}} According to one marine science professor, "We need it more than ever, and we’ve brought ourselves to the precipice of making great forecasts, but we can’t make it happen."&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt;

===Reducing chemical runoff===
[[File:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|px240|Soil and fertilizer runoff from a farm after heavy rains]]
The nitrates and phosphorus in fertilizers cause algal blooms when they run off into lakes and rivers after heavy rains. Modifications in farming methods have been suggested, such as only using fertilizer in a targeted way at the appropriate time exactly where it can do the most good for crops to reduce potential runoff.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; A method used successfully is [[drip irrigation]], which instead of widely dispersing fertilizers on fields, drip-irrigates plant roots through a network of tubes and emitters, leaving no traces of fertilizer to be washed away.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Seth M. ''Let There Be Water: Israel’s Solution for a Water-Starved World'', Macmillan (2015) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), drip irrigation also prevents the formation of algal blooms in [[reservoirs]] for drinking water&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/4819/Israel:_Innovations_overcoming_water_scarcity.html "Israel: Innovations overcoming water scarcity"], ''OECD Observer'', April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while saving up to 50% of water typically used by agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jun/16/israel-drought-water-reclamation/ "How Israel survived its devastating drought"], ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of states in the U.S. have tried eliminating [[phosphates in detergent]] and by cleaning{{Vague|date=September 2017}} water treatment plants, which succeeded in reducing the amount that entered Lake Erie by 66%.{{Failed verification|date=September 2017 |reason=No mention of 'cleaned' plants reducing phosphorus in cited article}} However, changes in farming practices during that period increased chemical runoff, thereby offsetting the improvements.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;Biello, David. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-algae-are-everywhere-thanks-to-agriculture/ "Deadly Algae Are Everywhere, Thanks to Agriculture"], ''Scientific American'', August 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been proposals to create buffer zones of foliage and wetlands to help filter out the phosphorus before it reaches water.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; Other experts have suggested using conservation tillage, changing crop rotations, and restoring wetlands.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; "The most important thing that can be done is to reduce agricultural runoff," according to a Great Lakes pollution expert. "Prevention is better than treatment."&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; Another expert states that it is possible for some dead zones to shrink within a year under proper management.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

There have been a few success stories in controlling chemicals. After Norway's lobster fishery collapsed in 1986 due to low oxygen levels, for instance, the government in neighboring Denmark took action and reduced phosphorus output by 80 percent which brought oxygen levels closer to normal.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;Larsen, Janet. [http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2004/update41 "Dead Zones Increasing in the World's Coastal Waters"], Earth Policy Institute, June 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, dead zones in the [[Black Sea]] and along the [[Danube River]] recovered after phosphorus applications by farmers were reduced by 60%.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

===Research and management===

In 2008, the U.S. government prepared a report on the problem, "Harmful Algal Bloom Management and Response: Assessment and Plan".&lt;ref name=US&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/jsost_hab0908.pdf "Harmful Algal Bloom Management and Response: Assessment and Plan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152427/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/jsost_hab0908.pdf |date=2013-05-10 }}, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Sept. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The change recognized the seriousness of the problem:
{{quote|It is widely believed that the frequency and geographic distribution of HABs have been increasing worldwide. All U.S. coastal states have experienced HABs over the last decade, and new species have emerged in some locations that were not previously known to cause problems. HAB frequency is also thought to be increasing in freshwater systems.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;}}
The report suggested among other remedies, using improved monitoring methods, trying to improve predictability, and testing new potential methods of controlling HABs.&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Some countries surrounding the Baltic Sea, which has the world's largest dead zone, have considered using massive geoengineering options, such as forcing air into bottom layers to aerate them.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

In 2015, NOAA created 12 new research grants totaling nearly $2.1 million which they would award to national organizations doing research on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, which they consider to be "two of the most scientifically complex and economically damaging coastal issues."&lt;ref name=NOAA4/&gt;

===Monitoring and reporting===
Most countries, states and large cities have departments which will help monitor and report incidents of algal blooms. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the U.S. launched the country's first algal bloom reporting system in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/a0622-algal-blooms.html "CDC launches first national reporting system for harmful algal blooms and associated illnesses"], CDC, June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental agencies in individual U.S. states will accept reports of blooms from citizens and will work with cities to test and report incidents to the media.

'''Immigration reduction''' refers to a movement in the United States that advocates a reduction in the amount of [[immigration]] allowed into the country. Steps advocated for reducing the numbers of [[immigrants]] include advocating stronger action to prevent [[illegal entry]] and [[illegal immigration]], and reductions in non-immigrant temporary [[work visas]] (such as [[H-1B visa|H-1B]] and [[L-1 visa|L-1]]). Some advocate a tightening of the requirements for legal immigration requirements to reduce total numbers, or move the proportions of legal immigrants away from those on [[Anchor baby|family reunification]] programs to skills-based criteria. What separates it from others who want [[immigration reform]] is that reductionists see immigration- or one of its forms- as being a significant source of social, economic, and environmental problems, and wish to cut current immigration levels.

Many immigration reformists support continued legal immigration, only opposing illegal immigration. Some immigration reductionists want legal immigration to be set at a percentage of current levels until fewer adverse effects are created by legal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tancredo's 2003 Bill [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R.946.IH:]''As used in this Act, the term `immigration moratorium' means the period beginning on October 1, 2003, and ending on September 30 of the first fiscal year after fiscal year 2008 during which the President submits a report to Congress, which is approved by a joint resolution of Congress, that the flow of illegal immigration has been reduced to less than 10,000 aliens per year and that any increase in legal immigration resulting from termination of the immigration moratorium would have no adverse impact on the wages and working conditions of United States citizens, the achievement or maintenance of Federal environmental quality standards, or the capacity of public schools, public hospitals, and other public facilities to serve the resident population in those localities where immigrants are likely to settle.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The related terminology "self-deportation" or "to self-deport" refers to the viewpoint that social policy that illegal immigration to the U.S. can be reduced by causing residents to leave the U.S. on their own, thus creating a reduction.

==History==

Antecedents to immigration reduction or control exist in antiquity, notably in the Roman Empire, where high living standards were an attractant to poorer tribes at the edge of the Empire. Specifically the immigration from Northern Africa, the Middle East, and of Germanic tribes from the northern European continent and Pictish peoples north of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Brittania]] were viewed as unwanted population influxes.

===Modern history of the immigration reduction movement===

There have been several discernible groups at various times within the United States, which pushed for immigration restrictions, with separate concerns, origins, and aims; thus there are several antecedents for the modern immigration reduction movement.  These include the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] United States American Party, often called the [[Know Nothing]] movement of the mid-19th century, which objected to increased [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] immigration of predominantly Irish and German origin; the [[Immigration Restriction League]], which objected to greatly increased immigration from southern and eastern Europe during the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and the joint congressional [[Dillingham Commission]], which studied this latter complaint and proposed numerical restrictions. Eventually, following [[World War I]], these studies led to the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].

[[Organized labor]] and parts of the political [[left-wing|left]] have also had an ongoing debate over immigration levels into the U.S. going back to the 19th century.  The [[National Labor Union]] (1866–1874) campaigned for immigration restrictions as well as the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], as did the [[American Federation of Labor]] under the leadership of [[Samuel Gompers]].  The [[AFL-CIO]] did not reverse its position on immigration restrictions until 1999.  The early [[United States Socialist Party]] was split over the issue, with some Socialist leaders including [[Jack London]] and Congressman [[Victor Berger]] supporting immigration restrictions; the party as a whole never had consensus and officially opposed only the importation of strikebreakers.

A separate issue with some overlap was concern over [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].  The leading early influence on that issue was [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], who both founded [[Population Connection|Zero Population Growth]] and published ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' in 1968. The popular book foretold alarming disasters that would inevitably occur in the next decades. Though some of his predictions did not come to pass, many believe his main points are valid, and they succeeded in inspiring a movement. Environmentalists including [[David R. Brower]] and [[David Foreman]] took the threat seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, B. Meredith. "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/061500-104.htm Immigration's Dire Effect on the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034228/http://www.commondreams.org/views/061500-104.htm |date=February 4, 2012 }}." [[Seattle Times]]. June 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Zero Population Growth organization did not involve itself, for the most part, in U.S. immigration policy, and a subset of the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] movement grew which believed that immigration needed to be reduced, arguing that immigration was driving most U.S. population growth.  These activists founded organizations separate from ZPG which would specifically address immigration issues.  Among the important early organizations was [[Negative Population Growth]], founded in 1972 by Donald Mann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org/whatis.html What is NPG?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608192353/http://www.npg.org/whatis.html |date=2011-06-08 }}. Negative Population Growth: Who We Are. Accessed January 5, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading inspiration for the modern movement is [[John Tanton]], a self-described [[Progressivism|progressive]] and critic of [[neoclassical economics]].[http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2608/keeping_america_empty/] Tanton founded the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR) in 1979, the largest and best funded organization in the movement. Three years later, Tanton formed ''US, Inc''. as an incubator and funding source to help form other organizations. According to public tax records, US, Inc, FAIR, and other Tanton organizations have received large donations from the [[Pioneer Fund]] and from the foundations controlled by [[Richard Mellon Scaife]]. Tanton created ''US English'' (an English-only advocacy group), the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] (CIS), [[ProEnglish]] (another English-only advocacy group),  and [[The Social Contract Press]].  US, Inc and FAIR have provided funding and logistical support to other organizations, including [[American Immigration Control Foundation]] (AICF), [[California Coalition for Immigration Reform]] (CCIR), [[Californians for Population Stabilization]] (CAPS), and the recent [[Protect Arizona Now]] (PAN) initiative, ''Proposition 200''. FAIR claims that there is a relationship between lax immigration policies and [[terrorism]] such as the [[9/11]] attack, and it asserts there is no connection between itself and eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_mediaff8a Dan Stein, ''Recognizing the Holes in Immigration Policies'', June 22, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{wikinews|Interview with U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Tom Tancredo}}

The movement seemed to be triumphant in 1994 when California voters passed [[Proposition 187]], an initiative that limited benefits to illegal aliens that had been authored and promoted by CCIR. However, one federal judge enjoined implementation of parts of the law as unconstitutional, and Democratic governor [[Gray Davis]] refused to pursue an appeal of the lower court decision, abandoning Proposition 187.  Residual resentment over the racially divisive campaigns on both sides of the issue made immigration a topic that politicians largely avoided dealing with. A notable exception has been [[Tom Tancredo]], who was elected to Congress from [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1994. Together with [[Patrick Buchanan]] and the Tanton network, Tancredo has emerged as the most conspicuous voice advocating immigration reform in Congress.

The immigration reduction movement was partly rejuvenated by The ''Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population'' coalition. In 1997 members from a range of immigration reduction and environmental organizations met to rededicate themselves to the effort of population stabilization. Organized by Population-Environment Balance, it included such diverse groups as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balance.org/asap/asapsignatories.html Signatories - Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population].

*[[Californians for Population Stabilization]] (CAPS)
*[http://www.carryingcapacity.org/index.html Carrying Capacity Network] (CCN) '''*Carrying Capacity Network closed their D.C. office in 2010'''
Another effort was the coalition formed under the name ''U.S. Sustainable Population Policy Project'' (USS3P) in 1996 by [[Doug LaFollette|Douglas La Follette]] and [[David Pimentel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecofuture.org/pop/uss3p.html|title=USS3P - U.S. Sustainable Population Policy Project - EcoFuture Population and Sustainability|first=Fred|last=Elbel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USS3P membership contained many immigration reductionists of the time. In 1999 it sought cosponsors for a major national conference on immigration. A number of major individuals and minor organizations joined as co-sponsors, but no large national groups joined and it folded in 2000 without holding the intended conference.

The Internet offered new opportunities for communication by immigration reductionists, as it has with countless other movements. [[Peter Brimelow]] founded his [[VDARE]] writers collective in 1999. The year 1999 also saw the founding by Craig Nelson of [[ProjectUSA]] in New York City, which used billboards to advertise [[Census Bureau]] and other statistics about immigration in a campaign dubbed "Billboard Democracy," and publishes an ezine in which the term "Minuteman" was first used (2002) in connection with civilian border patrols. The [[NumbersUSA]] group founded by [[Roy Beck]] set up automated system for website visitors to send advocacy faxes to their legislators on immigration topics.  Numerous websites, email lists, weblogs, and other resources furthered the effort.

The electoral success of [[Arizona]]'s Proposition 200, PAN, indicates the support for immigration reductionism among voters. The PAN initiative qualified for the ballot following the expenditure by FAIR of hundreds of thousands of dollars for signature gathering, plus comparable sums for campaigning with some additional amounts raised locally. The initiative was adopted by the public by a significant margin and is likely to inspire similar efforts in other states.  The success of Proposition 200 in Arizona was followed in April 2005 by the [[Minuteman Project]], in which volunteers came to Arizona to help patrol the border, although this project did not have the support of the [[United States Border Patrol]] and generated some controversy.  The organizers of the Minuteman Project have announced plans for similar projects in other states including [[Texas]], [[California]], and [[Michigan]].

==Reasons for reducing immigration==
{{POV|date=April 2013}}
Reasons for favoring immigration reduction given by supporters include:
*[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] and other [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues.
*Continued strong population growth through immigration drives up demand for housing.  Although various factors impact housing prices, high population growth conflicts with goals for "affordable housing."
*High levels of immigration may be seen as providing a steady source of cheap or low-wage [[labour (economics)|labor]] to [[corporations]].  This can be seen as detrimental to [[wages|wage]] levels in the U.S., and as a threat to the ability of [[labor union]]s to organize workplaces, with the threat always present that if workers organize they can easily be replaced by cheaper legal or illegal labor.
*Mass immigration has long been blamed for interfering with the employment of [[African-Americans]] and other minorities.&lt;ref name="PoC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ImmigrationHurtsPOC.com|title=Immigration Hurts Blacks and other Minorities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some believe the high levels of immigration into the US, whether legal or illegal, are at rates too high to allow recent immigrants to assimilate into US culture and discourages recent immigrants from learning the [[English language]].
*Illegal immigration is often seen as symptomatic of widespread lawbreaking by employers, who hire workers illegally in the country in order to escape wage, workplace safety, and labor laws.  This is especially a problem in the [[agriculture]] sector, where it is estimated that over 80% of workers are in the country illegally.  Supporters and critics of the movement debate over whether these workers could easily be replaced by legal workers being paid in accordance with wage laws.
*Temporary work visas are often used to replace high-wage workers in industries such as [[computer]] programming, [[biotechnology]] and [[engineering]] with lower-wage workers imported from other countries. This is seen by many{{who|date=December 2010}} as closely related to the practices of [[outsourcing]] and [[offshoring]] of jobs. The overall erosion of wages has been claimed to have resulted in many fewer Americans opting to pursue scientific majors in college and careers, and an overall decrease in the scientific ability of America's citizenry.

==Target immigration levels==
Immigration reductionists differ on the ideal level of immigration they would like to see into the United States.  Some believe the numbers should be set each year at whatever level would, in conjunction with the current [[fertility rate]] and emigration from the U.S., maintain zero population growth in the country.  The most prominent immigration reductionist in government today is U.S. Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] R-CO. Tancredo has authored a bill that calls for limiting annual immigration to between 30,000 and 300,000. The organization, [[Population-Environment Balance]] (PEB), has issued a ''Immigration Moratorium Action Plan'' [http://www.balance.org/asap/asapplan.html] calling for a "non-piercable" cap of 100,000 persons annually, which would be a 95% cut from current levels. [[Carrying Capacity Network]] (CCN), another small reductionist group closely related to PEB, shares that goal while repeating that it is not opposed to immigration.

There are also some who support a moratorium on immigration. The [[Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America]] claims that 43% of Californians polled said that a 3-year moratorium on immigration would be beneficial to the state (compared to 40% who said it would be unbeneficial).[https://web.archive.org/web/20041209192005/http://www.diversityalliance.org/docs/Poll-press.html] The [[America First Party (2002)|America First Party]] calls for a ten-year moratorium, with only spouses and children of citizens allowed in. [http://www.americafirstparty.org/docs/platform.shtml] Other advocates for  moratoriums include the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]][http://reformparty.org/platform.htm] and 2004 [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] presidential candidate [[Michael Peroutka]] [http://www.issues2000.org/2004/Michael_Peroutka_Immigration.htm]. [[Robert Locke]] surpasses them by calling for a negative immigration rate. He has defined this as restricting immigration to the U.S. to what he calls the "normal" (i.e., pre-1965) average flow of immigrants throughout U.S. history, combined with the [[deportation]] of all illegal immigrants.[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=2427]

The Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance '''(Now Defunct)''', two groups that both operate out of the same Washington, D.C. address, issue frequent statements that advocating for the numbers recommended by the Jordan Commission, 700,000 annually, is "counter-productive". In a ''National Alert'' the CCN warned that organizations supporting numbers higher than 300,000 undercut the movement, and they specifically criticize the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041130023309/http://carryingcapacity.org/ealert2.html]

Some groups not connected to the immigration reduction movement nonetheless support a reduction to legal immigration levels of around 500,000 to 600,000. In their 1997 book, ''Misplaced Blame'', Alan Durning and Christopher Crowther of Northwest Environment Watch write that illegal immigration gets too much attention, and identify five main sources of population growth, including lack of access to [[family planning]] as well as a misguided legal immigration policy, and subsidies to domestic migration. They readily admit that immigration should be reduced by an unspecified amount, but they also show concern for the rights of existing residents. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040113202707/http://www.northwestwatch.org/publications/mpblamedownload.asp].  The AFL-CIO and some mainstream [[environmentalist]] groups used to be on record favoring lower immigration numbers, although most have quietly dropped this position in recent years.

==Proposed methods of reducing illegal immigration==

===Border barriers===
{{Main article|Mexico–United States barrier}}
The focus of some immigration reduction groups is hindering [[illegal entry]] by building barriers on the border.  The [[United States-Mexico barrier]] has been partially constructed to reduce the flow of unauthorized migrants into the United States. Mexico is constructing a barrier to immigration along its southern border. Presently, [[India]] is constructing a fence along the border to restrict migrants from [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref name="BBC-FOOC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Villagers left in limbo by border fence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4653810.stm|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=BBC|date=2006-01-28|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the {{convert|4,000|km|mi|sp=us}} long [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]]; The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and to bring a close to unauthorized migration from Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="JPost-Fences"&gt;{{cite web|title=The good fences epidemic|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=2007-02-14|work=The Jerusalem Post|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209170816/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|archivedate=2011-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline"&gt;{{cite news|title=India builds a 2,500-mile barrier to rival the Great Wall of China|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article782933.ece|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|date=2005-12-28|work=The Times Online website | location=London | first=Raekha | last=Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Republic of China]] is building a security barrier along its border with [[North Korea]] to prevent defectors or refugees from North Korea from entering the country illegally.&lt;ref name="Jurist"&gt;{{cite web|title=China building border fence facing North Korea |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/10/china-building-border-fence-facing.php |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=Bernard J.

===Attrition through enforcement===
{{main|Self-deportation}}
Pro-enforcement U.S. think tanks such as the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] have supported an "attrition through enforcement" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cis.org/articles/2006/back406.html | publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]] | title=Attrition Through Enforcement: A Cost-Effective Strategy to Shrink the Illegal Population | author=Vaughan, Jessica M. |date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim here is to, as that organization states, "Shrink the illegal population through consistent, across-the-board enforcement of the immigration law. By deterring the settlement of new illegals, by increasing deportations to the extent possible, and, most importantly, by increasing the number of illegals already here who give up and deport themselves, the United States can bring about an annual decrease in the illegal-alien population, rather than allowing it to continually increase."&lt;ref name="cis.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back605.html|title=Downsizing Illegal Immigration|website=CIS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach concedes that mass deportations of illegal aliens is logistically, economically, and politically untenable.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt;

[[Arizona SB1070]], the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure enacted in the U.S. in generations,&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html?ref=us | title=U.S.’s Toughest Immigration Law Is Signed in Arizona | author=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 24, 2010 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly states its intent as implementing the attrition through enforcement strategy.&lt;ref name="sb1070 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf | title=State of Arizona: Senate Bill 1070, Section 1.| publisher=[[Arizona State Legislature]] | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental cooperation===
Conservative blogger [[Michelle Malkin]] supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of [[Section 287(g)]] of the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]]. Section 287(g) provides for the deputization of state and local law enforcement officers, for the purposes of reporting of immigrants who have violated immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michellemalkin.com/2005/01/17/bushs-open-borders-nominees-2/|title=MichelleMalkin.com|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022142806/http://michellemalkin.com/2005/01/17/bushs-open-borders-nominees-2/|archivedate=2007-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morristown, New Jersey]] mayor [[Donald Cresitello]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]) has sought to deputize his police as immigration agents. [[Newark, New Jersey]] city councilman Ron Rice, Jr. has proposed a resolution mandating police to report felony suspects when they are found to be in the United State illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Llorente, "Newark killings become immigration flash point," North Jersey Media Group, August 14, 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr%3DeXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTgxNjYzJnlyaXJ5N2Y3MTdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Ng%3D%3D |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070616140555/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTgxNjYzJnlyaXJ5N2Y3MTdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Ng== |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 16, 2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]] [[Anne Milgram]] has expanded officers power regarding [[illegal immigrant]]s. She told the [[state police]] to inform federal authorities when an illegal immigrant is arrested in an indictable crime or for drunk driving. There are an estimated 380,000 people living in New Jersey without proper immigration documents. She said that she wanted local, county and state police to hand more serious cases directly to [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Baldwin, "State AG broadens officers' power over illegal immigrants" "Gannett New Jersey" August 23, 2007  http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/NEWS01/708230422/1006/news01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative initiatives===
Others focus on [[lobbying]] to lower future illegal immigration levels through congressional action, and to fight amnesties for existing illegal immigrants.

Many immigration restrictionists question the 1898 Supreme Court ruling ''[[U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark]],'' which held that individuals born on U.S. soil to non-citizen parents are U.S. citizens and guaranteed all the rights thereof. They feel that citizenship should be denied to the children of immigrants without valid immigration status.  Thus they have sought to end [[Birthright citizenship in the United States of America|birthright citizenship]], through a constitutional amendment or a congressional act.

Denial of public benefits to undocumented individuals is believed to remove the incentives and rewards for illegal immigrants.  The 1994 California [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]] and the 2004 Arizona Proposition 200 ''[[Protect Arizona Now]]'' were written to require proof of legal status in order to receive non-mandated benefits.

==Differences within immigration reductionism==
Many who support reduced immigration numbers oppose association with the more extreme groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/2608/keeping_america_empty|title=Keeping America Empty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] has spoken out in 2004 against the views of another reductionist leader, [[Virginia Abernethy]], calling her views "repulsive separatist views," and called on her to resign from the advisory board of Protect Arizona Now in Arizona. PEB and CCN are also critical of FAIR for FAIR's support of a national ID card, which PEB and CCN oppose. The Protect Arizona Now movement split, with two rival state-level organizations, one supported by FAIR, the other supported by PEB and CCN, working to support the passage of the ballot initiative.

==Public opinion on immigration reduction==
Some polls such as a late 2013 survey by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] have found widespread opposition to immigration reduction. Said survey stated that 63% of Americans support creating a pathway to citizenship so that formerly illegal residents of the U.S. could gradually acquire it while only 18% back a hypothetical plan to find and deport all illegal residents.&lt;ref name=long-past&gt;{{cite news | last = Frumin | first =Aliyah | title = Obama: ‘Long past time’ for immigration reform | date = November 25, 2013| url = http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/obama-long-past-time-reform | publisher = [[MSNBC.com]]|accessdate = January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kavli Institute for Cosmology''', [[Cambridge]] ('''KICC''') is a research establishment set up through collaboration of the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|Kavli Foundation]]. It is operated by two of the University's astronomy groups: the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]] (IoA) and the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]].

==Background==
In August 2006 an agreement was reached between the University of Cambridge and the Kavli Foundation for the establishment of an Institute for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavlifoundation.org/kavli-news/university-cambridge-and-kavli-foundation-create-pioneering-new-research-center-examine-v| title=The University of Cambridge and The Kavli Foundation Create a Pioneering New Research Center to Examine the Very Beginnings of the Universe| accessdate=28 July 2012| date=1 November 2006| work=Kavli News |publisher=The Kavli Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kavli Foundation will support several 5-year senior research fellowships in perpetuity, and the University committed to provide a building to house the Institute. Operation began in October 2008 with the appointment of the first Kavli Institute Fellows. The building was completed in July 2009, and was officially opened 18 November 2009 by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor of the University]] in a ceremony with [[Fred Kavli]].

The director of the Institute is Roberto Maiolino; the deputy director is Anthony Challinor. The first director was [[George Efstathiou]] of the IoA.

==Projects==
KICC researchers are involved in the following projects:

* [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]]
* [[Dark Energy Survey]]
* [[Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument]]
* [[Extremely Large Telescope]]
* [[Illustris project]]
* [[James Webb Space Telescope]]
* KLEVER (Kmos LEnsed Velocity and Emission line Review)
* [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]]
* MaNGA sky survey
* MOONS galaxy survey
* Planck cosmological survey
* [[Square Kilometre Array]]
* [[Simons Observatory]]

==Kavli Building==

The Kavli Building is located adjacent to the Hoyle Building, the main building of the IoA. The two are connected via a raised walkway.

It is intended to be similar in architectural style to the Hoyle Building, but to be sufficiently distinctive so as to retain an independent identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarch.co.uk/architecture/kavli-institute-cosmology-cambridge| title=Kavli Institute: Architecture| accessdate=28 July 2012| date=2008|publisher=Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects were Annand and Mustoe.

{{sexual orientation}}
The '''Kinsey scale''', also called the '''Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale''',&lt;ref name="kinsey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale|publisher=The [[Kinsey Institute]]|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in research to describe a person's [[sexual orientation]] based on their experience or response at a given time. The scale typically ranges from 0, meaning exclusively [[heterosexual]], to 6, meaning exclusively [[homosexual]]. In both the male and female volumes of the ''[[Kinsey Reports]]'', an additional grade, listed as "X", indicated "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions". The reports were first published in ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) by [[Alfred Kinsey]], [[Wardell Pomeroy]], and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953).&lt;ref name="kinsey" /&gt;
==History ==
Alfred Kinsey, the creator of the Kinsey scale, is known as "the father of the sexual revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/history/index.php|title=Kinsey History|website=www.kinseyinstitute.org|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsey scale was created in order to demonstrate that sexuality does not fit into two strict categories: homosexual and heterosexual. Instead, Kinsey believed that sexuality is fluid and subject to change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of using sociocultural labels, Kinsey primarily used assessments of behavior in order to rate individuals on the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?af=R&amp;mobileUi=0|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey's first rating scale had thirty categories that represented thirty different case studies, but his final scale has only seven categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexarchive.info/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEXOR4.HTM|title=Archive for Sexology|website=www.sexarchive.info|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 8,000 interviews were coordinated throughout his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullough|first=Vern L.|date=January 2010|title=Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey report: Historical overview and lasting contributions|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499809551925|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=35|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introducing the scale, Kinsey wrote:
{{cquote|Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] in each and every one of its aspects.

While emphasizing the continuity of the gradations between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual histories, it has seemed desirable to develop some sort of classification which could be based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and homosexual experience or response in each history [...] An individual may be assigned a position on this scale, for each period in his life. [...] A seven-point scale comes nearer to showing the many gradations that actually exist.|Kinsey, et al. (1948). pp. 639, 656}}

== Table of the scale ==

The Kinsey scale ranges from 0, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively heterosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with their same sex, to 6, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively homosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with those of the opposite sex, and 1-5 for those who would identify themselves with varying levels of desire for sexual activity with either sex, including "incidental" or "occasional" desire for sexual activity with the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html |title=Kinsey Sexuality Rating Scale |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsey recognized that the seven categories of the scale could not fully capture every individual's sexuality. He wrote that "it should be recognized that the reality includes individuals of every intermediate type, lying in a continuum between the two extremes and between each and every category on the scale."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHWHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage|title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Female|last=Kinsey|first=Alfred C.|last2=Pomeroy|first2=Wardell B.|last3=Martin|first3=Clyde E.|last4=Gebhard|first4=Paul H.|date=1998-05-22|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253019240|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists [[Martin S. Weinberg]] and [[Colin J. Williams]] write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered [[bisexual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Martin S. |author2=Williams, Colin J. |author3=Pryor, Douglas W. |title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-19-509841-2 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey disliked the use of the term ''bisexual'' to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use ''bisexual'' in its original, biological sense as [[hermaphroditic]]; he stated, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."&lt;ref name="Stange"/&gt; Psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women|Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, although the additional X grade used to mean "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions" is today described as [[asexuality]],&lt;ref name="Stange"&gt;{{cite book|authors =Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan |title = Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn = 978-1-4129-7685-5|publisher=Sage Pubns|year=2011|page=158|accessdate=December 17, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar Justin J. Lehmiller stated, "the Kinsey X classification emphasized a lack of sexual behavior, whereas the modern definition of asexuality emphasizes a lack of sexual attraction. As such, the Kinsey Scale may not be sufficient for accurate classification of asexuality."&lt;ref name="Lehmiller"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|page=250|date=2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Kinsey reports ===
{{Main|Kinsey Reports}}
The Kinsey Reports are two published works, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" and "Sexual Behavior in the Human male". These reports look into the sexual characteristics and development of the human males and females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt; Sexuality is examined in the Kinsey scale through the level of homosexuality in each person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt; The data to scale the participants comes from their "psychosexual responses and/or overt experience" in relation to sexual attraction and activity with the same and opposite sexes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The inclusion of psychosexual responses allows someone with less sexual experience to rank evenly with someone of greater sexual experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;!--Anyone who has access to the reports please complete the findings for prevalence of Kinsey 0, 1, 2, and 4. The statistics below were taken from http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/ak-data.html --&gt;

* '''Men''': 11.6% of white males aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651"&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1948. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'', Table 147, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt;  The study also reported that 10% of American males surveyed were "more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55" (in the 5 to 6 range).&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt;
* '''Women''': 7% of single females aged 20–35 and 4% of previously married females aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', Table 142, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; 2% to 6% of females, aged 20–35, were given a rating of 5&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; and 1% to 3% of unmarried females aged 20–35 were rated as 6.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', Table 142, p. 499, and p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

The results found in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" show a higher amount of men who lean towards homosexuality than recorded for the women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kinsey addresses that the result is contrary to reports that women have more homosexual leanings than men. He poses that such reports are due to the "wishful thinking on the part of such heterosexual males."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Impact and later developments ==
===General===
{{Main|Scales of sexual orientation}}
The Kinsey scale is credited as one of the first attempts to "acknowledge the diversity and fluidity of human sexual behavior" by illustrating that "sexuality does not fall neatly into the [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] categories of exclusively heterosexual or exclusively homosexual."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=18 June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=404–432|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies regarding homosexuality, at the time, were conducted by medical professionals who were sought out by individuals that wanted to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Sell ScD &amp; Christian Petrulio BA (1996) Sampling Homosexuals, Bisexuals, Gays, and Lesbians for Public Health Research:, Journal of Homosexuality, 30:4, 31-47, DOI: 10.1300/J082v30n04_02&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Kinsey's publications on human sexuality, which encompasses the Kinsey scale, were widely advertised and had a huge impact on society's modern conceptions of sexuality, post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;“Page 167.” Sexual Revolution and the Politics of Gay Identity, by Jeffery Escoffier.&lt;/ref&gt; His work incorporates thousands of men and women who deviate widely on the Kinsey Scale.

Galupo et al. argued, "Despite the availability of the Kinsey Scale, assessment via [[Sociocultural perspective|sociocultural]] labels (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual) is the predominant modality for determining the sexual orientation of research participants."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many sexologists see the Kinsey scale as relevant to sexual orientation, but not comprehensive enough to cover all [[sexual identity]] aspects. Measures of sexual orientation do not always correlate with individuals' self-identification labels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, sexual identity involves more than one component and may also involve [[biological sex]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm |title=Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender |publisher=Planned Parenthood |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bullough et al. argued that this "wide-scale public discussion of human sexuality" ultimately led Americans to challenge traditional [[heteronormative]] behaviors. His research and findings encouraged [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s to [[Coming out|come out]] by debunking a lot of stigma revolved around homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, V.L. Arch Sex Behav (2004) 33: 277. https://doi.org/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000026627.24993.03&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have further defined the scale. In 1980, Michael Storms proposed a two dimensional chart with an X and Y axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of Models of Sexual Orientation |url=http://www.uwlax.edu/pridecenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf |publisher=University of Wisconsin–La Crosse |accessdate=September 6, 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715130712/http://www.uwlax.edu/PrideCenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scale explicitly takes into account the case of asexuality and the simultaneous expression of hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |title=Graph of Michael Storm Scale versus Kinsey Scale |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001438/http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Klein, in his [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]], included factors such as how orientation can change throughout a person's lifetime, as well as emotional and social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaninstituteofbisexuality.org/thekleingrid/|title=The Klein Grid|website=AIB|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey, Storm, and Klein are only three of more than 200 scales to measure and describe sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author1=Clive M. Davis |author2=William L. Yarber |author3=Robert Bauserman |author4=George Schreer |author5=Sandra L. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are scales that rate homosexual behaviors from 1 to 14, and measures for gender, masculinity, femininity, and transsexualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html|publisher=The Kinsey Institute|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author1=Clive M. Davis |author2=William L. Yarber |author3=Robert Bauserman |author4=George Schreer |author5=Sandra L. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveys and other studies===
There have been similar studies using a scale from 0 to 10. In such studies, the person would be asked a question such as "If 0 is completely gay and 10 is completely hetero, what is your orientation number?".&lt;ref&gt;Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity (2006) – Janbell L Caroll&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2014 aimed to explore "[[sexual minority]] individuals' qualitative responses regarding the ways in which the Kinsey Scale [...] captures (or fail to capture) their sexuality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants completed the [Kinsey] scale and then were asked to respond to the following question: "In what ways did this scale capture or fail to capture your sexuality?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "A diverse sample of sexual minority participants, including individuals who (1) identify outside the traditional sexual orientation labels (i.e. [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[queer]], fluid, [[Asexuality|asexual]]) and (2) identify as [[transgender]], were recruited to complete an online questionnaire."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants represented a convenience sample of 285 individuals who self-identified as [[non-heterosexual]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Approximately one third of participants self-identified primarily as [[Monosexuality|monosexual]] (31.5%), whereas 65.8% identified as nonmonosexual, and 2.8% identified as asexual. Monosexual participants represented those who self-identified as lesbian (18.5%) or gay (12.2%) or homosexual (0.8%). Nonmonosexual participants included bisexual (24.1%), pansexual (16.8%), queer (19.6%), and fluid (1.4%) participants. A small minority of participants identified as 'other' (3.8%)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants represented all regions of the continental United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this study, the use of "X" was intended to describe asexuality or individuals who identify as nonsexual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For a 2015 [[YouGov]] UK survey, when asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, 72% of all adults, and 46% of adults aged 18–24 years, picked a score of zero, totally heterosexual. On the other side, 4% of the total sample, and 6% of young adults, picked a score of six, meaning a totally homosexual identity.  Overall, 89% of the population described themselves as heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Will Dahlgreen. YouGov UK 2015 [https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/16/half-young-not-heterosexual/ 1 in 2 young people say they are not 100% heterosexual]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study published in 2017, questioned how people who do not identify as heterosexual felt about their representation on the Kinsey Scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|last2=Mitchell|first2=Renae C.|last3=Davis|first3=Kyle S.|date=2018-05-01|title=Face Validity Ratings of Sexual Orientation Scales by Sexual Minority Adults: Effects of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-1037-y|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=47|issue=4|pages=1241–1250|doi=10.1007/s10508-017-1037-y|issn=0004-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study takes a group of minority individuals who sexually identify as something other than heterosexual, and has them rate the Kinsey scale according to how well they feel represented by their value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each group gave it a rating between 1 and 5. In the results, the group that rated the scale the highest was the group that identified as lesbian or gay with a rating of 4.66.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The bisexual group rated it lower at 3.78, and the pansexual/queer group gave it the lowest rating at 2.68.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another trend present in the results of the study, was that in regards to gender identity the [[cisgender]] group gave the scale a higher rating than the transgender group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The cisgender rating was 4.09 and the transgender was 2.78.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Literary nonsense''' (or '''nonsense literature''') is a broad categorization of [[literature]] that balances elements that make sense with some that do not, with the effect of subverting language conventions or logical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though the most well-known form of literary nonsense is [[nonsense verse]], the genre is present in many forms of literature.

The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Its humor is derived from its nonsensical nature, rather than wit or the "joke" of a punchline.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, ''Anatomy'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Jabberwocky creatures.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[John Tenniel]]'s depiction of the nonsense creatures in [[Lewis Carroll|Carroll]]'s ''[[Jabberwocky]]''.]]

Literary nonsense, as recognized since the nineteenth century, comes from a combination of two broad artistic sources. The first and older source is the oral folk tradition, including games, songs, dramas, and rhymes, such as the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, ''Boshen'', pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; The literary figure [[Mother Goose]] represents common incarnations of this style of writing.

The second, newer source of literary nonsense is in the intellectual absurdities of [[court poet]]s, scholars, and intellectuals of various kinds. These writers often created sophisticated nonsense forms of Latin parodies, religious [[Travesti (theatre)|travesties]], and political satire, though these texts are distinguished from more pure satire and parody by their exaggerated nonsensical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's literary nonsense comes from a combination of both sources.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not the first to write this hybrid kind of nonsense, [[Edward Lear]] developed and popularized it in his many [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s (starting with ''[[A Book of Nonsense]]'', 1846) and other famous texts such as ''The Owl and the Pussycat'', ''The Dong with a Luminous Nose,'' ''[[s:The Jumblies|The Jumblies]]'' and ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Around the World''. [[Lewis Carroll]] continued this trend, making literary nonsense a worldwide phenomenon with ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871). Carroll's poem "[[Jabberwocky]]", which appears in the latter book, is often considered quintessential nonsense literature.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory==

In literary nonsense, certain formal elements of language and logic that facilitate meaning are balanced by elements that negate meaning. These formal elements include semantics, syntax, phonetics, context, representation, and formal diction.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre is most easily recognizable by the various techniques or devices it uses to create this balance of meaning and lack of meaning, such as faulty cause and effect, [[portmanteau]], [[neologism]], reversals and inversions, imprecision (including gibberish), simultaneity, picture/text incongruity, arbitrariness, infinite repetition, negativity or mirroring, and misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, ''Anatomy'', pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonsense tautology, reduplication, and absurd precision have also been used in the nonsense genre.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Naissance, pp. xxvi–xxix&lt;/ref&gt; For a text to be within the genre of literary nonsense, it must have an abundance of nonsense techniques woven into the fabric of the piece. If the text employs only occasional nonsense devices, then it may not be classified as literary nonsense, though there may be a nonsensical effect to certain portions of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Lecercle, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', for instance, employs the nonsense device of imprecision by including a blank page, but this is only one nonsense device in a novel that otherwise makes sense.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Flann O'Brien's ''The Third Policeman'', on the other hand, many of the devices of nonsense are present throughout, and thus it could be considered a nonsense novel.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 85, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction==

Gibberish, light verse, fantasy, and jokes and riddles are sometimes mistaken for literary nonsense, and the confusion is greater because nonsense can sometimes inhabit these (and many other) forms and genres.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Shortsleeve, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure gibberish, as in the "hey diddle diddle" of nursery rhyme, is a device of nonsense, but it does not make a text, overall, literary nonsense. If there is not significant sense to balance out such devices, then the text dissolves into literal (as opposed to literary) nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Light verse, which is generally speaking humorous verse meant to entertain, may share humor, inconsequentiality, and playfulness, with nonsense, but it usually has a clear point or joke, and does not have the requisite tension between meaning and lack of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense is distinct from [[fantasy]], though there are sometimes resemblances between them. While nonsense may employ the strange creatures, other worldly situations, magic, and talking animals of fantasy, these supernatural phenomena are not nonsensical if they have a discernible logic supporting their existence. The distinction lies in the coherent and unified nature of fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Everything follows logic within the rules of the fantasy world; the nonsense world, on the other hand, has no comprehensive system of logic, although it may imply the existence of an inscrutable one, just beyond our grasp.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of magic within an imaginary world is an example of this distinction. Fantasy worlds employ the presence of magic to logically explain the impossible. In nonsense literature, magic is rare but when it does occur, its nonsensical nature only adds to the mystery rather than logically explaining anything. An example of nonsensical magic occurs in Carl Sandburg's ''[[Rootabaga Stories]]'', when Jason Squiff, in possession of a magical "gold buckskin whincher", has his hat, mittens, and shoes turn into popcorn because, according to the "rules" of the magic, "You have a letter Q in your name and because you have the pleasure and happiness of having a Q in your name you must have a popcorn hat, popcorn mittens and popcorn shoes".&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riddles]] only appear to be nonsense until the answer is found. The most famous nonsense riddle is only so because it originally had no answer.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, ''Anatomy'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland'', the Mad Hatter asks Alice "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?" When Alice gives up, the Hatter replies that he does not know either, creating a nonsensical riddle.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Some seemingly nonsense texts are actually riddles, such as the popular 1940s song ''[[Mairzy Doats]]'', which at first appears to have little discernible meaning but has a discoverable message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dennislivingston.com/jl_mairzy.htm|title=Cabaret and Jazz Songs by Dennis Livingston|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes are not nonsense because their humor comes from their making sense, from our "getting" it, while nonsense is funny because it does ''not'' make sense, we do not "get" it.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience ==

While most contemporary nonsense has been written for children, the form has an extensive history in adult configurations before the nineteenth century. Figures such as John Hoskyns, Henry Peacham, [[John Sandford (poet)|John Sandford]], and [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]] lived in the early seventeenth century and were noted nonsense authors in their time.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonsense was also an important element in the works of [[Flann O'Brien]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]]. Literary nonsense, as opposed to the folk forms of nonsense that have always existed in written history, was only first written for children in the early nineteenth century. It was popularized by [[Edward Lear]] and then later by [[Lewis Carroll]]. Today literary nonsense enjoys a shared audience of adults and children.

== Nonsense writers ==
'''''Note''': None of these writers are considered ''exclusively'' a "nonsense writer." Some of them wrote texts considered to be in the genre (as in Lear, Carroll, Gorey, Lennon, Sandburg), while others only use nonsense as an occasional device (as in Joyce, Juster). All of these writers wrote outside of the nonsense genre also.''&lt;ref&gt;Noakes, Vivien, Edward Lear, The Life of a Wanderer, Sutton.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
[[Bob Dylan]] wrote some lyrics that contain nonsense techniques, especially around the mid-1960s, in songs like "Bob Dylan's 115th Dream" and "Tombstone Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Tarantula, Scribner (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], frontman of the [[art rock]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] group [[Talking Heads]], employed nonsensical techniques in songwriting. Byrne often combined coherent yet unrelated phrases to make up nonsensical lyrics in songs such as: "[[Burning Down the House]]", "Making Flippy Floppy" and "Girlfriend Is Better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catharsis.tumblr.com/post/465840647/david-byrne-on-musical-collaborations |title=desideratum &amp;#124; David Byrne on reevaluating ideas and finding |publisher=Catharsis.tumblr.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency formed the basis of the title for the Talking Heads concert movie, ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''. More recently, Byrne published ''Arboretum'' (2006), a volume of tree-like diagrams that are, "mental maps of imaginary territory".  He continues, explaining the aspect of nonsense: "Irrational logic – [...]. The application of logical scientific rigor and form to basically irrational premises. To proceed, carefully and deliberately, from nonsense, with a straight face, often arriving at a new kind of sense."&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Why?'' in Arboretum, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syd Barrett]], one-time frontman and founder of [[Pink Floyd]], was known for his often nonsensical songwriting influenced by Lear and Carroll that featured heavily on Pink Floyd's first album, ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/25/syd-barrett-irregular-head-review|title=Syd Barrett: A Very Irregular Head by Rob Chapman|accessdate=24 April 2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sean | last=O'Hagan | date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glen Baxter (cartoonist)|Glen Baxter]]'s [[comic]] work is often nonsense, relying on the baffling interplay between word and image.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, pp. 189–195&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'', by [[Bill Griffith]], is an American strip that mixes philosophy, including what has been called "Heideggerian disruptions"&lt;ref&gt;Grabiner, July/Aug, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and pop culture in its nonsensical processes.&lt;ref&gt;Lecercle, p. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mail chute''' is a largely defunct letter collection device used in early multi-storey office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings and other high rise structures. Letters were dropped from the upper storeys and collected (usually at the ground level) at a central depository by the postal service. This innovation was before the time of the modern "mail room" normally associated nowadays with high rise buildings. It was for the convenience of the users of the building so they would not have to take their mail to an outside [[letter box|mail box]] or to the post office.&lt;ref name ="postal4"&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2b1c1_cutler.html|title= National Postal Museum, a Smithsonian Institution museum - Cutler Mail Box &amp; Chute|accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original design and usage==
[[James Goold Cutler]] received {{US patent|284951}} on September 11, 1883 for the mail chute.&lt;ref name ="postal2"&gt; {{cite news|url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/04/01/341022/index.htm|title= CNNMoney article - Gone but Not (Quite) Forgotten|accessdate= 2008-09-19 | first=Maggie | last=Overfelt | date=2003-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one was installed in 1884 in the [[Elwood Building]] in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt; Cutler ultimately received thirty patents for variations of his invention. The original approved patent No. 284,951 design stated that it must "be of metal, distinctly marked '''U.S. Letter Box,'''" and that the "door must open on hinges on one side, with the bottom of the door not less than 2'6" above the floor." If the building were more than two [[storey|stories]] tall, the collection box was to be outfitted with a cushion to prevent injury to the mail. The mail chutes had to be accessible along its entire length so lodged mail could be removed.&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt;

The first experimental "Cutler mail chute" device was successful at the Elwood Building so later it was installed in two New York City office buildings. Additional ones were then installed in railroad stations and some public buildings as a test. Eventually Cutler Mail Box produced over 1,600 such devices in buildings over the next twenty years.&lt;ref name ="postal2"/&gt; Then the postal service allowed "Cutler mail chutes" to be placed in hotels taller than five storeys. They were also installed in public apartment buildings of more than fifty apartments.&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt;

It was announced on Sunday, May 9, 1909, by ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation".&lt;ref name ="postal1"&gt; {{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1909/05/09/archives/mail-chute-men-in-merger-cutler-and-other-companies-join-in-a.html|title= MAIL CHUTE MEN IN MERGER.; Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation.|accessdate= 2009-02-20 | work=The New York Times | date=1909-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for clogs to form in a mail chute. &lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt; For two weeks in 1986, more than 40,000 letters accumulated in the mail chute of the [[1221 Avenue of the Americas|McGraw-Hill Building]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=Clog&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Daneil B.|title=F.Y.I.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/nyregion/fyi-583979.html|accessdate=7 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, a spokesperson for the New York district of the Postal Service claimed that the service responded to two or three calls to clear stuck mail chutes every week.&lt;ref name=Clog /&gt;

==Current use==
In more recent decades, buildings such as Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]], the [[Chrysler Building]], and the old [[General Electric Building|RCA Building]] in New York City have shut down their chutes.&lt;ref name ="postal2"/&gt; The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with mail chutes, and more than 900 active chutes exist in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]] of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=New York City's Mail Chutes are Lovely, Ingenious and Almost Entirely Ignored|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/new-york-citys-mail-chutes-are-lovely-ingenious-and-almost-entirely-ignored|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, however, the [[National Fire Protection Association]] has banned mail chutes in all new building construction. Buildings currently using mail chutes in New York include the Chanin Building, Trinity Building, Empire State Building, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and in Boston the historic [[The Lenox Hotel | Lenox Hotel]] in the Back Bay.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}   [[Image:IdahoBldgMailChute02026.JPG|thumb|widthpx|A Cutler mail chute, still in service as of 2010, in the lobby of the Idaho Building in downtown [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].]]

==Other installations==
The London Transport HQ at [[55 Broadway]] had a system installed. The chute slot for 'London &amp; Abroad' mail plate says 'Cutler Mailing-System Cutler-Mail-Chute-Co Rochester,NY,USA'.(As shown BBC 'Art Deco Icons: London Transport' TV programme aired Nov 09.)
The 14-story Richmond Trust Company Building (629 E. Main St., Richmond, VA)[a.k.a. Southern States Building or Virginia Department of Environmental Health Building], completed in 1922, has an inactive Cutler mail chute system. Hotel Saskatchewan in Regina, Manitoba, Canada still has an operational mail cutler system. [[Stelco Tower]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada, completed in 1973, also has an operational mail chute; a rare example of a mail chute in a modern skyscraper.

'''Methanogens''' are microorganisms that produce [[methane]] as a [[metabolic]] byproduct in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] conditions. They are prokaryotic and belong to the domain of [[archaea]]. They are common in [[wetland]]s, where they are responsible for [[marsh gas]], and in the digestive tracts of animals such as [[ruminant]]s and [[human]]s, where they are responsible for the methane content of [[belching]] in ruminants and [[flatulence]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;

==Physical description==

Methanogens are coccoid (spherical shaped) or bacilli (rod shaped). There are over 50 described species of methanogens, which do not form a [[monophyletic]] group, although all methanogens belong to [[Archaea]].  They are mostly [[anaerobic organism]]s that cannot function under aerobic conditions, but recently a species (''[[Candidatus]] [[Methanothrix paradoxum]]'') has been identified that can function in anoxic microsites within aerobic environments. They are very sensitive to the presence of [[oxygen]] even at trace level. Usually, they cannot sustain oxygen stress for a prolonged time. However, ''[[Methanosarcina barkeri]]'' is exceptional in possessing a [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) [[enzyme]], and may survive longer than the others in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters V |author2=Conrad R |date=1995 |title=Methanogenic and other strictly anaerobic bacteria in desert soil and other oxic sois |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1673–1676|pmid=16535011 |pmc=1388429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecenter.uark.edu/JillJabstract.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327135553/http://spacecenter.uark.edu/JillJabstract.doc |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methanogens, called [[hydrogenotroph]]ic, use [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a source of carbon, and [[hydrogen]] as a [[reducing agent]].

The reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] into [[methane]] in the presence of [[hydrogen]] can be expressed as follows:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with the hydrogen to produce methane, which creates an [[electrochemical gradient]] across cell membrane, used to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[chemiosmosis]]. In contrast, [[plant]]s and [[algae]] use water as their [[reducing agent]].

Methanogens lack [[peptidoglycan]], a polymer that is found in the [[cell wall]]s of the [[Bacteria]] but not in those of Archaea. Some methanogens have a cell wall that is composed of [[pseudopeptidoglycan]]. Other methanogens do not, but have at least one [[paracrystalline]] array (S-layer) made up of [[protein]]s that fit together like a [[jigsaw puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00495/abstract|title=Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria|last=Boone|first=David R.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781118960608|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00495/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme living areas==
Methanogens play the vital ecological role in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic environments]] of removing excess hydrogen and fermentation products that have been produced by other forms of [[anaerobic respiration]]. Methanogens typically thrive in environments in which all [[electron acceptor]]s other than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrate]],  ferric[[iron]] (Fe(III)), and [[sulfate]]) have been depleted.  In deep [[basalt]]ic rocks near the [[mid ocean ridge]]s, they can obtain their [[hydrogen]] from the [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite reactions|serpentinisation]] reaction of [[olivine]] as observed in the [[Lost City (hydrothermal field)|hydrothermal field of Lost City]].

The thermal breakdown of water and water [[radiolysis]] are other possible sources of hydrogen.

Methanogens are key agents of remineralization of [[organic carbon]] in [[continental margin]] sediments and other aquatic sediments with high rates of sedimentation and high sediment organic matter.  Under the correct conditions of pressure and temperature, biogenic methane can accumulate in massive deposits of [[methane clathrate]]s,&lt;ref name="Kvenvolden 1995"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kvenvolden| first= K.| date=1995| title= A review of the geochemistry of methane in natural gas hydrate| journal= Organic Geochemistry| volume=23| issue=11–12| pages=997–1008| doi= 10.1016/0146-6380(96)00002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which account for a significant fraction of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and represent a key reservoir of a potent greenhouse gas.&lt;ref name="Milkov 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milkov| first=Alexei V| date=2004| title= Global estimates of hydrate-bound gas in marine sediments: how much is really out there?| journal= Earth-Science Reviews| volume=66| issue=3–4| pages=183–197| doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2003.11.002| bibcode=2004ESRv...66..183M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanogens have been found in several extreme environments on Earth – buried under kilometres of ice in [[Greenland]] and living in hot, dry desert soil. They are known to be the most common archaebacteria in deep subterranean habitats. Live microbes making methane were found in a glacial ice core sample retrieved from about three kilometres under Greenland by researchers from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. They also found a constant metabolism able to repair macromolecular damage, at temperatures of 145 to –40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0507601102|title=Microbial origin of excess methane in glacial ice and implications for life on Mars|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=102|issue=51|pages=18292|year=2005|last1=Tung|first1=H.

Another study&lt;ref&gt;Icarus (vol. 178, p. 277)cs:Methanogen&lt;/ref&gt; has also discovered methanogens in a harsh environment on Earth. Researchers studied dozens of soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in [[Utah]], [[Idaho]] and [[California]] in the [[United States]], and in [[Canada]] and [[Chile]]. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the [[Mars Desert Research Station]] in Utah were found to have signs of viable methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn8428-extreme-bugs-back-idea-of-life-on-mars.html Extreme bugs back idea of life on Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have proposed that the presence of methane in the [[Mars|Martian]] atmosphere may be indicative of native methanogens on that planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/051220_science_tuesday.html|title=Crater Critters: Where Mars Microbes Might Lurk|work=Space.com|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to the methanogens are the anaerobic methane oxidizers, which utilize methane as a substrate in conjunction with the reduction of sulfate and nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/440878a | author=Thauer, R. K. |author2=Shima, S. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Biogeochemistry: Methane and microbes | journal = Nature | date = 2006 | volume = 440 | issue =  7086| pages=878–879 | pmid=16612369 |bibcode = 2006Natur.440..878T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most methanogens are [[autotrophic]] producers, but those that [[oxidize]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are classed as [[chemotroph]] instead.

==Comparative genomics and molecular signatures==

Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 31 signature proteins which are specific for the methanogens (also known as ''Methanoarchaeota''). Most of these proteins are related to methanogenesis, and they could serve as potential molecular markers for the methanogens.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gao B |author2=Gupta RS |date=2007 |title=Phylogenomic analysis of proteins that are distinctive of Archaea and its main subgroups and the origin of methanogenesis |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=8 |page=86 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-8-86 |pmid=17394648 |pmc=1852104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 10 proteins found in all methanogens which are shared by ''[[Archaeoglobus]]'', suggest that these two groups are related.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; In phylogenetic trees, the methanogens are not monophyletic and they are generally split into three clades.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gribaldo S |author2=Brochier-Armanet C |title=The origin and evolution of Archaea: a state of the art |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |date=2006 |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=1007–1022 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1841 |pmid=16754611 |pmc=1578729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the unique shared presence of large numbers of proteins by all methanogens could be due to lateral gene transfers.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

== Metabolism ==

=== Methane production ===
Methanogens are known to produce methane from substrates such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, acetate, formate, methanol and methylamines in a process called [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blaut|first=M.|date=1994|title=Metabolism of methanogens|journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|volume=66|issue=1–3|pages=187–208|issn=0003-6072|pmid=7747931|doi=10.1007/bf00871639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different methanogenic reactions are catalyzed by unique sets of [[enzyme]]s and [[coenzymes]]. While reaction mechanism and energetics vary between one reaction and another, all of these reactions contribute to net positive energy production by creating ion [[concentration gradient]]s that are used to drive ATP synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dybas|first=M|last2=Konisky|first2=J|date=1992|title=Energy transduction in the methanogen Methanococcus voltae is based on a sodium current.|url=|journal=J Bacteriol|volume=174 | issue = 17 |pages=5575–5583|via=|doi=10.1128/jb.174.17.5575-5583.1992|pmc=206501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall reaction for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis is:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + 4 H2 -&gt; CH4 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt; (∆G˚’ = -134 kJ/mol CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)

Well-studied organisms that produce methane via H2/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis include ''Methanosarcina barkeri'', ''Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum'', and ''Methanobacterium wolfei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karrasch|first=M.|last2=Börner|first2=G.|last3=Enssle|first3=M.|last4=Thauer|first4=R.

In the earliest stage of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binds to [[methylfuran]] (MF) and is reduced to formyl-MF. This [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] reductive process (∆G˚’= +16 kJ/mol) is dependent on the availability of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is catalyzed by the enzyme formyl-MF dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2 + MF -&gt; HCO-MF + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The formyl constituent of formyl-MF is then transferred to the coenzyme [[tetrahydromethanopterin]] (H4MPT) and is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme known as [[Formyltransferase|formyl transferase]].  This results in the formation of formyl-H4MPT.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;HCO-MF + H4MPT -&gt; HCO-H4MPT + MF&lt;/chem&gt;

Formyl-H4MPT is subsequently reduced to methenyl-H4MPT. Methenyl-H4MPT then undergoes a one-step hydrolysis followed by a two-step reduction to methyl-H4MPT. The two-step reversible reduction is assisted by [[Coenzyme F420|coenzyme F&lt;sub&gt;420&lt;/sub&gt;]] whose hydride acceptor spontaneously oxidizes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once oxidized, F&lt;sub&gt;420&lt;/sub&gt;’s electron supply is replenished by accepting electrons from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This step is catalyzed by methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zirngibl|first=C|date=February 1990|title=N5,N10-Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has hydrogenase activity|url=|journal=Laboratorium fir Mikrobiologie|volume=261 | issue = 1 |pages=112–116|via=|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(90)80649-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
Methanogens are widely used in anaerobic digestors to treat wastewater as well as aqueous organic pollutants. Industries have selected methanogens for their ability to perform [[biomethanation]] during wastewater decomposition thereby rendering the process sustainable and cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;Appels, Lise; et.al. (2008). "Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge" Progress in Energy and Combustion Science. 34 (6): 755 -781. doi: 10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.002&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-decomposition in the anaerobic digester involves a four-staged cooperative action performed by different microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas H; et.al. (2010). "Anaerobic Digestion: Process" Solid Waste Technology &amp; Management, Volume 1 &amp; 2. doi: 10.1002/9780470666883.ch372&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is the hydrolysis of insoluble polymerized organic matter by anaerobes such as Streptococcus and Enterobacterium.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Fayyaz Ali, et. al. (2014). “Microbial Ecology of Anaerobic Digesters: The Key Players of Anaerobiosis” ScientificWorldJournal. 3852369 (1). doi:10.1155/2014/183752&lt;/ref&gt; In the second stage, acidogens breakdown dissolved organic pollutants in wastewater to [[fatty acids]]. In the third stage, acetogens convert fatty acids to [[acetates]]. In the final stage, methanogens metabolize acetates to gaseous [[methane]]. The byproduct methane leaves the aqueous layer and serves as an energy source to power wastewater-processing within the digestor, thus generating a self-sustaining mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lettinga | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Anaerobic Digestion and Wastewater Treatment Systems | url = | journal = Antonie van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 67 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi = 10.1007/bf00872193 | pmid = 7741528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanogens also effectively decrease the concentration of organic matter in wastewater run-off and minimizes [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="doi_10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017"/&gt; For instance, agricultural wastewater, highly rich in organic material, has been a major cause of aquatic ecosystem degradation. The chemical imbalances can lead to severe ramifications such as [[eutrophication]]. Through anaerobic digestion, the purification of wastewater can prevent unexpected blooms in water systems as well as trap [[methanogenesis]] within digesters. This allocates biomethane for energy production and prevents a potent greenhouse gas, methane, from being released into the atmosphere.

The organic components of wastewater vary vastly. Chemical structures of the organic matter select for specific methanogens to perform anaerobic digestion. An example is the members of [[Methanosaeta]] genus dominate the digestion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and brewery waste.&lt;ref name="doi_10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017"/&gt; Modernizing wastewater treatment systems to incorporate higher diversity of microorganisms to decrease organic content in treatment is under active research in the field of microbiological and chemical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Marihiro, Takashi., Sekiguchi, Yuji. (2007). "Microbial communities in anaerobic digestion processes for waste and wastewater treatment: a microbiological update" Current Opinion in Biotechnology. 18 (3): 273-278. doi: 10.1016/j.copbio.2007.04.003&lt;/ref&gt; Current new generations of Staged Multi-Phase Anaerobic reactors and Upflow Sludge Bed reactor systems are designed to have innovated features to counter high loading wastewater input, extreme temperature conditions, and possible inhibitory compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Lettinga, G; et.al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">The '''ORTF stereo microphone system''', also known as [[Side-Other-Side]], is a [[microphone]] technique used to record [[stereo sound]].

[[Image:ORTF-Stereo.svg|thumb|ORTF setup.]]

It was devised around 1960 at the [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]]
(ORTF) at [[Radio France]].

ORTF combines both the volume difference provided as sound arrives on- and off-axis at two [[cardioid]] microphones spread to a 110° angle, as well as the timing difference as sound arrives at the two microphones spaced 17 cm apart. &lt;ref&gt;[http://old.hfm-detmold.de/eti/projekte/semesterarbeiten/hauptmikro/hauptmikro_en.html Microphone Techniques for Stereo Recording]. Retrieved January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The microphones should be as similar as possible, preferably a frequency-matched pair of an identical type and model.

The result is a realistic stereo field that has reasonable compatibility with mono playback. Since the cardioid polar pattern rejects off-axis sound, less of the ambient room characteristics are picked up. This means that the mics can be placed farther away from the sound sources, resulting in a blend that may be more appealing. Further, the availability of purpose-built microphone mounts makes ORTF easy to achieve.

As with all microphone arrangements, the spacing and angle can be manually adjusted slightly by ear for the best sound, which may vary depending on room acoustics, source characteristics, and other factors. But this arrangement is defined as it is because it was the result of considerable research and experimentation, and its results are predictable and repeatable.

These interchannel differences are not the same as interaural differences, as produced by [[artificial head]] recordings. Even the spacing of 17 cm is not strictly based on interaural ear spacing. The recording angle for this microphone system is ±48° = 96°. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddingaudio.com/downloads/Rycote%20Technical/The%20Stereophonic%20Zoom.pdf The stereophonic zoom - pdf].

'''Perforate leaves''', sometimes called '''[[wikt:fenestrate#Adjective|fenestrate]]''', occur naturally in some species of plants. Holes develop as a leaf grows.

The size, shape, and quantity of holes in each leaf can vary greatly depending on the species and can even vary greatly within a given species. Perforation is caused by sections of leaf ceasing cell growth or by dying during an early stage in the development of the leaf. These deformations that are created earliest in the leaf development end up looking more like slashes whereas those that develop later end up looking more like holes. This trait is found in only one species in [[Aponogetonaceae]] and a few genera in [[Araceae]].

It is not fully known what evolutionary purpose perforation serves, but there are several possibilities. Perforation could serve the purpose of reducing the chances of leaves tearing in high winds or it could help to maximize the amount of rain that's able to reach the plant's roots. It could help to cool the plant by producing turbulence around the leaf. Another possibility is that perforation is a defense against herbivory. The holes might make the leaf look less enticing to herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Christopher D. "How Did the Swiss Cheese Plant Get Its Holes?" The American Naturalist 181.2 (2013): 273-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|200px|A 12th-century [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscript of the [[Hippocratic oath]].]]
'''Professional ethics'''  encompass the personal, and corporate standards of behavior expected by [[professional]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/ProfessionalConduct/Constitution/CodeOfConduct/2005RIBACodeOfProfessionalConduct.pdf Royal Institute of British Architects - Code of professional conduct] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618044002/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/ProfessionalConduct/Constitution/CodeOfConduct/2005RIBACodeOfProfessionalConduct.pdf |date=2013-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word professionalism originally applied to vows of a religious order. By at least the year 1675, the term had seen secular application and was applied to the three learned professions: [[Divinity]], [[Law]], and [[Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.co.wise.tx.us/constable/Downloads/Professionalism%20and%20Ethics.pdf|title = Professionalism and Ethics|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term professionalism was also used for the military profession around this same time.

Professionals and those working in acknowledged professions exercise specialist knowledge and skill. How the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Chadwick (1998). Professional Ethics. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved October 20, 2006, from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/professional-ethics/v-1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not attained the necessary knowledge and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Whitbeck, "Ethics in Engineering Practice and Research" Cambridge University Press, 1998 page 40&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the [[Hippocratic oath]] to which medical [[physician|doctors]] still adhere to this day.

==Components==
Some professional organizations may define their ethical approach in terms of a number of discrete components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&amp;fileExtension=PDF RICS- MAINTAINING PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216090731/http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&amp;fileExtension=PDF |date=2011-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically these include:
*[[Honesty]]
*[[Integrity]]
*[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]]
*[[Accountability]]
*[[Confidentiality]]
*[[Objectivity (journalism)|Objectivity]]
*[[Respect]]
*[[Legal|Obedience to the law]]
*[[Loyalty]]

==Implementation==
Most professionals have internally enforced codes of practice that members of the profession must follow to prevent [[wikt:exploitation|exploitation]] of the client and to preserve the integrity of the profession. This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public’s trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services.

===Internal regulation===
In cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members.  This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Brazier, ‘’Medicine, Patients and the Law’’, Penguin, 1987 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory regulation==
In many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the [[statutory body|statutory bodies]] that regulate [[nursing]] and [[midwife]]ry in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry-Professional regulation - nursing: the UKCC ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729062133/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts.

==Examples==
For example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a [[car crash]] victim because they could not give an appropriate [[emergency treatment]]. Though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct [[diagnosis]] and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to not help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as [[negligent]] and [[unethical]]. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be [[wikt:egregious|egregious]] repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the [[Good Samaritan law|"Good Samaritan" laws]] if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life.

A business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrupulous scrupulous] engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a [[bribe]], thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Davis, ‘Thinking like an Engineer’ in Philosophy and Public Affairs, 20.2 (1991) page 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separatism===
On a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society.&lt;ref name=Gewirth&gt;{{cite journal

 | issue =2
 | pages =282–300
 | date =Jan 1986
 | jstor =2381378
 | doi=10.1086/292747}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|282}} For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be [[detrimental]] to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient's [[autonomy]], as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong. However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contravene contravene] other moral demands in order to meet this goal.&lt;ref name=Gewirth/&gt;{{rp|284}} Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies (see [[moral relativism]]). If [[moral universalism]] is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.&lt;ref name=Gewirth/&gt;{{rp|285}}.

==Student ethics==
As attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, [[colleges]] and [[universities]] are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students.  Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Colleges Preparing Students For The Workplace|url=http://www.thecollegesolution.com/are-colleges-preparing-students-for-the-workplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from College.

===Codes of conduct===
Codes of conduct, such as the St. Xavier Code of Conduct, are becoming more a staple in the academic lives of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SXU Code of Conduct|url=http://www.sxu.edu/academics/resources/cie/conduct.asp|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years. Such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling.

Not only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Conduct|url=http://handbook.sxu.edu/Student/Code_Conduct/student_conduct.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ruderal community Dittrichia viscosa on gravel01.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A single-species ruderal community of ''[[Dittrichia viscosa]]'' on gravel near [[Petah Tikva]]-Sgula railway station, [[Israel]]. (Compare with mixed-species image below.)]]

A '''ruderal species''' is a [[plant]] [[species]] that is first to colonize disturbed lands. The disturbance may be natural{{spaced ndash}} for example, [[wildfire]]s or [[Landslide|avalanche]]s{{spaced ndash}}or a consequence of human activity, such as construction ([[Road construction|of roads]], [[building construction|of buildings]], [[mining]], etc.) or agriculture (abandoned fields, [[irrigation]], etc.).

The word ''[[Wikt:ruderal|ruderal]]'' comes from the Latin ''rudus'' [[rubble]].

Ruderal species typically dominate the disturbed area for a few years, gradually losing the [[Competition (biology)|competition]] to other native species. However, in extreme disturbance circumstances, such as when the natural [[topsoil]] is covered with a foreign substance, a single-species ruderal community may become permanently established, as depicted in the image on the right. In addition, some ruderal [[invasive species]] may have such a competitive advantage over the native species that they, too, may permanently prevent a disturbed area from returning to its original state despite natural topsoil.

== Features ==

Features contributing to a species' success as ruderal are:
* Massive seed production
* [[Germination|Seedling]]s whose [[Plant nutrition|nutritional]] requirements are modest
* Fast-growing roots{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* Independence of [[mycorrhizae]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* [[Polyploidy]]

==Quantification==

Ecologists have proposed various scales for quantifying ruderality, which can be defined as the "ability to thrive where there is disturbance through partial or total destruction of plant biomass" (Grime, Hodgson &amp; Hunt, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hill, M.O. |author2=Roy, D.B. |author3=Thompson, K. |year=2002 |title=Hemeroby, urbanity and ruderality: bioindicators of disturbance and human impact |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=708–720 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00746.x |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruderality scale of [[J. Philip Grime|Grime]] presents values that are readily available, and it takes into account disturbance factors as well as other indicators such as the annual or perennial character of the plants.

'''Social determinism''' is the theory that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behavior (as opposed to biological or objective factors).

Consider certain [[human behavior]]s, such as committing murder, or writing poetry.  A social determinist would look only at social phenomena, such as customs and expectations, education, and interpersonal interactions, to decide whether or not a given person would exhibit any of these behaviors. They would discount biological and other non-social factors, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup, the physical environment, etc. Ideas about nature and biology would be considered to be [[Social construction|socially constructed]].

== Social determinism and ideology ==
The socially determined actions of an individual can be influenced by forces that control the flow of ideas. By creating an [[ideology]] within the society of the individual, the individual's actions and reactions to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] are predetermined to adhere to the [[social rules]] imposed on him/her. Ideologies can be created using social institutions such as schooling, which "have become the terrain upon which contending forces express their social and political interest" (Mayberry 3), or the mass media, which has "significant power in shaping the social agenda and framing of public opinion to support that agenda" (Colaguori 35).

By creating a social construction of reality, these forces directly create a [[hegemonic]] control over the future of individuals who feel like the social construct is natural and therefore unchangeable. Their actions become based in the context of their society so that, even if they possess an innate talent for a sport, if the social construction implies that their race is unathletic in general, or their nation or state does not produce athletes, they do not include the possibility of athleticism in their future. Their society has successfully determined their actions.

Social determinism can favor a political party's agenda by setting social rules so that the individual considers the party's agenda to be morally correct, an example being the 2010 G20 summit riots in Toronto. The media, controlled by corporations and the governments with agendas of their own, publicizes the riots as violent and dangerous, but the goal of the rioters, to rebel against those whose position in power enables them to abuse the system for personal gain, is lost because the focus is on the violence. The individuals' view on the subject are then directly influenced by the media and their reactions are predetermined by that social form of control. "We have been taught to think that censorship is the main mechanism of how the media uses information as a form of social control, but in fact what ''is'' said, and how it is ''selectively presented'', is a far more powerful form of information control." (Colaguori 35).

Social determinism was first studied by [[Emile Durkheim]] (1858 - 1917), French philosopher considered as the father of the social science.

== Social determinism ==
Social determinism is most commonly understood in opposition to [[biological determinism]]. Within the [[media studies]] discipline, however, social determinism is understood as the counterpart of technological determinism.
[[Technological determinism]] is the notion that technological change and development is inevitable, and that the characteristics of any given technology determine the way it is used by the society in which it is developed. The concept of technological determinism is dependent upon the premise that social changes come about as a result of the new capabilities that new technologies enable.

The notion of social determinism opposes this perspective. Social determinism perceives technology as a result of the society in which it is developed. A number of contemporary media theorists have provided persuasive accounts of social determinism, including Leila Green.

In her book ''Technoculture'' Leila Green examines in detail the workings of a social determinist perspective, and argues “social processes determine technology for social purposes”. {{Harv|Green|2001}} She claims that every technological development throughout history was born of a social need, be this need economical, political or military. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

According to Green, technology is always developed with a particular purpose or objective in mind. As the development of technology is necessarily facilitated by financial funding, a social determinist perspective recognizes that technology is always developed to benefit those who are capable of funding its development.

Thus social determinists perceive that technological development is not only determined by the society in which it occurs, but that it is inevitably shaped by the power structures that exist in that society. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

==Arguments against social determinism==
{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Scientific studies have shown that [[social behavior]] is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings. The infants are born with an inherited social skill.

Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

With the introduction of the [[Marine biology|marine]] [[propeller]] back in the early 19th century, [[cavitation]] during operation has always been a limiting factor on efficiency of ships. Cavitation in marine propellers develops when the propeller operates at a high speed and reduces efficiency of the propeller. Ever since the introduction of the propeller, solutions for cavitation have been developed and tested. [[File:Marine_Propeller.jpg|thumb|Replica of a propeller from the USS Monitor]]

== Nozzle System ==
As the name suggests, this systems uses a set of [[nozzle]]s to help reduce and prevent the likelihood of cavitation in propellers. This system was developed by Samsung Shipping which is based in South Korea. In order to reduce the possibility of cavitation happening in marine propellers, a set of nozzles are placed on the hull of the ship directly in front of the propeller. These nozzles spray out compressed air over the propeller that creates “a macro bubble”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jeung-Hoon|last2=Park|first2=Hyoung-Gil|last3=Kim|first3=Jin-Hak|last4=Lee|first4=Kyung-Jun|last5=Seo|first5=Jong-Soo|date=2014-02-01|title=Reduction of propeller cavitation induced hull exciting pressure by a reflected wave from air-bubble layer|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801813004368|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=77|pages=23–32|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2013.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bubble completely encompasses the propeller that is in operation. With the differing characteristics of the seawater outside of the bubble and the air inside, a zone develops that has the ability to reduce the “[[Resonance|resonance frequency]]”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to this reduction, cavitation is less likely to occur during operation of a marine propeller.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To determine how effective this nozzle system could be, multiple tests were carried out with the nozzles and without them. In these tests, it was discovered that the resonance frequencies and the likelihood of cavitation could be reduced by up to 75%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those who conducted these tests also tried two different arrangements of the nozzles to find out which one was more effective. The first arrangement used only one nozzle, which though it used considerably less power than the other option, it was not nearly as successful. The multi-nozzle system, on the other hand, gave much better results but required more power to operate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While this nozzle system has major drawbacks particularly in its power requirements, the possibility of cavitation in the operation of marine propellers is reduced considerably. Thus, to some ship owners and operators, the cost of installing these nozzles and operating them is outweighed by the benefits of increased efficiency in their propellers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Air-Filled Rubber Membrane ==
The Air-Filled [[Natural rubber|Rubber]] [[Membrane]], so it’s called, uses the same principles as the Nozzle System to reduce cavitation in marine propellers. Since the Nozzle System requires a large source of energy to operate, the creators sought to create a system that has the same results but is cheaper to operate. This membrane builds on the lessons learned in designing the Nozzle System and uses a pocket of air to prevent cavitation but does not require nozzles or compressors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jeung-Hoon|last2=Lee|first2=Kyung-Jun|last3=Park|first3=Hyoung-Gil|last4=Kim|first4=Jin-Hak|date=2015-07-15|title=Possibility of air-filled rubber membrane for reducing hull exciting pressure induced by propeller cavitation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801815001602|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=103|pages=160–170|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2015.04.073}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the same time as limiting the cost of operation, this membrane provides just as much protection against cavitation as the nozzles do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Air-Filled Rubber Membrane is placed directly behind an operating marine propeller in the hull. As described before, the differing characteristics of the air in the membrane and the [[seawater]] around it reduce the resonance frequency, which in turn increases the point at which cavitation is encountered.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The membrane is specially designed which, along with the use of rubber, furthers the effect of reducing the frequency.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This membrane is cheaper to operate than the Propeller Control System+ and the Nozzle System but is not as effective as the PCS+ in reducing cavitation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Different Materials for Propellers ==
This solution focuses on the materials that marine propellers are created from which is a direct factor in cavitation. While redesigning propellers would only garner an extra one or two percent efficiency in operation, changing the materials a propeller is made from has greater effects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ingenia.org.uk/Ingenia/Articles/994|title=Quieter, more efficient propellers|last=Grunditz|first=G|first2=|date=2015-12-05|website=Ingenia, 65|publisher=|pages=37–42|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common blend that marine propellers are created from is the nickel aluminum bronze blend. While this blend can resist erosion which is why it is so common, it cannot properly handle cavitation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

However, this is beginning to change. The Royal Netherlands Navy for one is starting to experiment with composite materials like resins or [[Carbon nanotube|carbon fiber]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These materials, when formed into a propeller, are flexible enough under pressure to “deflect,” which can reduce cavitation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other  options are made from carbon fiber, [[Epoxy|epoxy resin]], or even [[glass]], and are able to produce “a hydro elastic effect”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since these new propellers can flex and are not nearly as rigid under pressure, the risk of cavitation is reduced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While replacing propellers would be the most efficient on ships that are currently under construction, the benefits from newer propeller materials could outweigh costs of replacing current marine propellers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite the initial cost of the propellers, this solution costs nothing to operate making it more feasible to shipping around the globe.

IOS Press. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the [[structure]]s and [[behavior]]s of the system.

A system architecture can consist of system [[System|components]] and the sub-systems developed, that will work together to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture, collectively these are called [[architecture description languages]] (ADLs).&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Clements (1996)  "[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/Survey_of_ADLs.pdf A survey of architecture description languages]."

== Overview ==
Various organizations can define systems architecture in different ways, including:

* The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;From [[ANSI]]/[[IEEE]] [[IEEE 1471|1471-2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A representation of a system, including a mapping of functionality onto hardware and [[software component]]s, a mapping of the [[software architecture]] onto the [[hardware architecture]], and human interaction with these components.&lt;ref&gt;From the [http://www.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University]'s [http://www.sei.cmu.edu Software Engineering Institute].&lt;/ref&gt;
* An allocated arrangement of physical elements which provides the design solution for a consumer product or life-cycle process intended to satisfy the requirements of the functional architecture and the requirements baseline.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://www.manningaffordability.com/s&amp;tweb/HEResource/Other/Definitions.htm The Human Engineering Home Page's Glossary].&lt;/ref&gt;
* An architecture consists of the most important, pervasive, top-level, strategic inventions, decisions, and their associated rationales about the overall structure (i.e., essential elements and their relationships) and associated characteristics and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;From  [http://www.opfro.org/Components/WorkProducts/ArchitectureSet/Architectures/Architectures.html OPEN Process Framework (OPF) Repository] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305173824/http://www.opfro.org/Components/WorkProducts/ArchitectureSet/Architectures/Architectures.html |date=2006-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A description of the design and contents of a [[computer system]]. If documented, it may include information such as a detailed inventory of current hardware, software and networking capabilities; a description of long-range plans and priorities for future purchases, and a plan for upgrading and/or replacing dated equipment and software.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/glossary.asp The National Center for Education Statistics glossary].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at component level to guide its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[[TOGAF]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The composite of the design architectures for products and their life-cycle processes.&lt;ref&gt;From [[IEEE]] 1220-1998 as found at [http://www.acq.osd.mil/osjtf/termsdef.html their glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517130043/http://www.acq.osd.mil/osjtf/termsdef.html |date=2006-05-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[TOGAF]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One can think of system architecture as a set of representations of an existing (or future) system. These representations initially describe a general, high-level functional organization, and are progressively refined to more detailed and concrete descriptions.

System architecture conveys the informational content of the [[wiktionary:element|elements]] consisting of a system, the relationships among those elements, and the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] governing those relationships. The architectural components and set of relationships between these components that an architecture description may consist of hardware, [[software]], documentation, facilities, manual procedures, or roles played by organizations or people.{{huh?|date=May 2014}}

A system architecture primarily concentrates on the internal [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s among the system's [[wikt:component|components]] or [[system|subsystem]]s, and on the interface(s)  between the system and its external environment, especially the [[User (computing)|user]].  (In the specific case of computer systems, this latter, special, interface is known as the [[computer human interface]], ''AKA'' human computer interface, or [[Human-computer interaction|CHI]]; formerly called the man-machine interface.)

One can contrast a system architecture with [[system architecture engineering]] (SAE) - the method and discipline for effectively implementing the architecture of a system:&lt;ref&gt;
The Method Framework for Engineering System Architectures, [[Donald Firesmith]] et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

* SAE is a ''method'' because a sequence of steps is prescribed{{by whom?|date=May 2014}} to produce or to change the architecture of a system within a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]].
* SAE is a ''discipline'' because a body of [[knowledge]] is used to inform [[wikt:practitioner|practitioner]]s as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints.

== History ==
Systems architecture depends heavily on practices and techniques which were developed over thousands of years in many other fields, perhaps the most important being civil architecture.

* Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the term "system" as it is still commonly used today.  However, with the arrival of [[digital computers]] and the development of [[software engineer]]ing as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts, software artifacts, and the combined artifacts.  A [[Computer program|programmable]] hardware artifact, or [[Computer|computing machine]], that lacks its [[computer program]] is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine.  However, a hardware machine and its programming can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks.  Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the term system came to be defined as containing all of the elements necessary (which generally includes both hardware and software) to perform a useful function.
* 
* Consequently, within these engineering disciplines, a system generally refers to a programmable hardware machine and its included program. And a [[systems engineer]] is defined as one concerned with the complete device, both hardware and software and, more particularly, all of the interfaces of the device, including that between hardware and software, and especially between the complete device and its user (the CHI).  The [[hardware designer|hardware engineer]] deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the [[software engineer]] deals (more or less) exclusively with the computer program; and the systems engineer is responsible for seeing that the program is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function.
* 
* A systems architecture makes use of elements of both software and hardware and is used to enable design of such a composite system.  A good architecture may be viewed as a 'partitioning [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]],' or [[algorithm]], which partitions all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements into a [[wikt:workable|workable]] set of cleanly [[bounded set|bounded]] [[subsystem]]s with nothing left over.  That is, it is a partitioning scheme which is [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusive]], [[Interval (mathematics)|inclusive]], and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustive]].  A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the sub systems so that there is a minimum of interdependencies needed among them.  In both software and hardware, a good sub system tends to be seen to be a meaningful "object".  Moreover, a good architecture provides for an easy mapping to the user's requirements and the [[Verification and Validation|validation tests]] of the user's requirements.  Ideally, a mapping also exists from every least element to every requirement and test.

[[Image:Whistler-Nocturne in black and gold.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]'' by James McNeill Whistler. Whistler sued Ruskin over his criticism of the painting.]]
[[File:12 Butterflies.jpg|thumb|Butterflies designed for the illustration of the book (c. 1890)]]

'''''The Gentle Art of Making Enemies''''' is a book by the painter [[James McNeill Whistler]], published in 1890. The book was in part a response to, in part a transcript of, Whistler's famous libel suit against critic [[John Ruskin]]. Ruskin, in a review of the inaugural showing at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], had referred to Whistler's painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]'' as "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Robert. ''John Ruskin''. Oxford University Press, 2007. pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The book contains Whistler's letters to newspapers chronicling his many petty grievances against various acquaintances and friends.

Whistler biographer [[Stanley Weintraub]] suggests the book was controversial enough that Whistler might have been better known for it than for his art at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Stanley. ''Whistler: A Biography''. De Capo Press, 2001: xi. {{ISBN|0-306-80971-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework is formed by large collections of [[anatomy|anatomical]], [[physiology|physiological]], and [[pathology|pathological]] data stored in digital format, typically by predictive simulations developed from these collections and by services intended to support researchers in the creation and maintenance of these models, as well as in the creation of end-user technologies to be used in the clinical practice. VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling).&lt;ref name="Fenner2008"/&gt; These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with population-based representations. The objective is to develop a systemic approach which avoids a [[reductionism|reductionist]] approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by [[scientific discipline]] ([[biology]], [[physiology]], [[biophysics]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[bioengineering]]) or anatomical sub-system ([[cardiovascular]], musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).&lt;ref name="Clapworthy2008"/&gt;

==History==

The initial concepts that led to the Virtual Physiological Human initiative came from the [[Physiome Project|IUPS Physiome Project]]. The project was started in 1997 and represented the first worldwide effort to define the [[physiome]] through the development of databases and models which facilitated the understanding of the integrative function of cells, organs, and organisms.&lt;ref name="HunterBorg2003"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hunter PJ, Borg TK | title=Integration from proteins to organs: the Physiome Project. | journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | year= 2003 | volume= 4 | issue= 3 | pages= 237–43 | pmid=12612642 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=12612642 | doi=10.1038/nrm1054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project focused on compiling and providing a central repository of databases that would link experimental information and computational models from many laboratories into a single, self-consistent framework.

Following the launch of the Physiome Project, there were many other worldwide initiatives of loosely coupled actions all focusing on the development of methods for modelling and simulation of human pathophysiology. In 2005, an expert workshop of the Physiome was held as part of the Functional Imaging and Modelling of the Heart Conference in Barcelona where a white paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Ayache N, Boissel JP, Brunak S, Clapworthy G, Lonsdale G, Fingberg J, Frangi A, Deco G, Hunter P, Nielsen P, Halstead M, Hose R, Magnin I, Martin-Sanchez F, Sloot P, Kaandorp J, Hoekstra A, Van Sint Jan S, Viceconti M |url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/health/docs/events/barcelona2005/ec-vph-white-paper2005nov.pdf |title=Towards virtual physiological human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology |format=PDF | publisher = edited by DG INFSO &amp; DG JRC |date= November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''Towards Virtual Physiological Human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology'' was presented. The goal of this paper was to shape a clear overview of on-going relevant VPH activities, to build a consensus on how they can be complemented by new initiatives for researchers in the EU and to identify possible mid-term and long term research challenges.

In 2006, the European Commission funded a coordination and support action entitled ''STEP: Structuring The EuroPhysiome''. The STEP consortium promoted a significant consensus process that involved more than 300 stakeholders including researchers, industry experts, policy makers, clinicians, etc.  The prime result of this process was a booklet entitled ''Seeding the EuroPhysiome: A Roadmap to the Virtual Physiological Human''.&lt;ref name="europhysiome1"/&gt; The STEP action and the resulting research roadmap were instrumental in the development of the VHP concept and in the initiation of much larger process that involves significant research funding, large collaborative projects, and a number of connected initiatives, not only in Europe but also in the United States, Japan, and China.

VPH now forms a core target of the 7th Framework Programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ 7th Framework Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Commission]], and aims to support the development of patient-specific computer models and their application in personalised and predictive healthcare.&lt;ref name="KohlNoble2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kohl P, Noble D | title=Systems biology and the virtual physiological human. | journal=Mol Syst Biol | year= 2009 | volume= 5 | issue=  1| page= 292 | pmid=19638973 | doi=10.1038/msb.2009.51 | pmc=2724980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virtual Physiological Human Network of Excellence (VPH NoE) aims to connect the various VPH projects within the 7th Framework Programme.

==Goals of the initiative==

VPH-related projects have received substantial funding from the European Commission in order to further scientific progress in this area. The European Commission is insistent that VPH-related projects demonstrate strong industrial participation and clearly indicate a route from basic science into clinical practice.&lt;ref name="Clapworthy2008"/&gt; In the future, it is hoped that the VPH will eventually lead to a better healthcare system which aims to produce the following benefits:&lt;ref name="europhysiome1"/&gt;

* personalized care solutions
* reduced need for experiments on animals
* more holistic approaches to medicine
* preventative approaches to treatment of disease

Personalized care solutions are a key aim of the VPH, with new modelling environments for predictive, individualized healthcare to result in better patient safety and drug efficacy. It is anticipated that the VPH could also result in healthcare improvement through greater understanding of pathophysiological processes.&lt;ref name="Fenner2008"/&gt; The use of biomedical data from a patient to simulate potential treatments and outcomes could prevent the patient from experiencing unnecessary or ineffective treatments.&lt;ref name="Sadiq2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadiq SK, Mazzeo MD, Zasada SJ, Manos S, Stoica I, Gale CV, etal | title=Patient-specific simulation as a basis for clinical decision-making. | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | year= 2008 | volume= 366 | issue= 1878 | pages= 3199–219 | pmid=18573758 |  url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18573758 | doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of in silico (by computer simulation) modelling and testing of drugs could also reduce the need for experiments on animals.

A future goal is that there will be also be a more holistic approach to medicine with the body treated as a single multi-organ system rather than as a collection of individual organs. Advanced integrative tools should further help to improve the European healthcare system on a number of different levels that include diagnosis, treatment and care of patients and in particular quality of life.&lt;ref name="europhysiome1"/&gt;
