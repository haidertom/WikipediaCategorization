{{Pakistan terrorist attacks}}
The '''2009 attack on the [[Sri Lanka national cricket team]]''' occurred on 3 March 2009, when a bus carrying [[Sri Lanka]]n [[cricket]]ers, part of a larger convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near [[Gaddafi Stadium]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="samaylive" /&gt; The cricketers were on their way to play the third day of the second [[Test cricket|Test]] against the [[Pakistani cricket team]]. Six members of the Sri Lanka national cricket team were wounded. Six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7920260.stm|title= Gunmen shoot Sri Lanka cricketers|date=3 March 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090304020128/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7920260.stm| archivedate= 4 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was believed to have been carried out by [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]]. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the attack were killed during a police raid in Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1171349/terrorists-involved-sri-lankan-cricket-team-attack-killed-lahore-raid/ Terrorists involved in Sri Lankan cricket team attack killed in Lahore raid]&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the attack's mastermind was killed in eastern [[Afghanistan]] during a military operation, while hiding there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1196066/sri-lanka-cricket-team-attack-mastermind-killed-afghanistan/ ri Lanka cricket team attack mastermind 'killed' in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the tour==
The safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been an issue.  In May 2002, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a [[2002 Karachi bus bombing|suicide bomb attack]] outside their hotel. However, they returned in the 2003/2004 season to fulfill their commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/newzealand/engine/series/61139.html |title=New Zealand in Pakistan ODI Series, 2003/04 |publisher=Cricinfo |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] had recently refused to tour on safety grounds.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s644978.htm|title=Australian cricket team cancel Pakistan tour|last=Knight|first=Ben |date=9 August 2002|work=ABC News|accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 2008–09|The Sri Lankan cricket team was in Pakistan]] as a replacement for the [[India national cricket team|Indian team]], who had pulled out after the [[Mumbai attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html|title=Sri Lanka have confirmed tour – Pakistan board|date=10 December 2008|work=Cricinfo Pakistan|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208034909/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html| archivedate=8 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to give them presidential-style security.&lt;ref name="NYT_Mar03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html|title=For Pakistan, Attack Exposes Security Flaws |last=Perlez|first=Jane|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-04| date=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402020739/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html| archivedate=2 April 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/298999.html |title=Cricinfo – South Africa in Pakistan Test Series, 2007/08 |publisher=Content-www.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
[[File:Location of 2009 Liberty chowk attack.png|thumb|left|250px|Black/grey depicts the route for team convoy. The escape route for attackers is shown in blue.]]

According to the officials, 12 gunmen were hiding near Liberty Square, in the centre of Lahore, waiting for the Sri Lankan team to pass on their way to the Gaddafi stadium. They started firing at the bus when it crossed the road. The [[Pakistan police]] escorting the team returned fire; in the ensuing fighting, six policemen and two civilians died. After about 20 minutes, the militants fled, leaving behind rocket launchers and grenades.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The gunmen first shot at the wheels of the bus, and then fired at the bus itself and its occupants.&lt;ref name="safe and out of danger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4931223/Sri-Lankans-safe-and-out-of-danger-after-Pakistan-terror-attack.html|title=Sri Lankans 'safe and out of danger' after Pakistan terror attack|date=3 March 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 March 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307084008/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4931223/Sri-Lankans-safe-and-out-of-danger-after-Pakistan-terror-attack.html| archivedate= 7 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had fired a rocket at the bus, which missed and hit a nearby electric pole. The driver of the bus, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, had then kept on driving a distance of about {{Convert|500|m|ft}} until they reached the stadium. Khalil was hailed as a hero for his bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903181732.htm|title=Pakistan honours bus driver Khalil for his brave act |date=18 March 2009|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2009-03-29|location=Chennai, India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090322124217/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903181732.htm| archivedate= 22 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/man-who-saved-sri-lankan-team-in-2009-lahore-attack-still-traumatised-995354.html | title=Man who saved Sri Lankan team in 2009 Lahore attack still traumatised | work=[[Network18]] | date=August 17, 2015 | accessdate=May 27, 2017 | agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had also thrown a grenade under the bus, which exploded after the bus had passed over it.&lt;ref name="lucky to survive" /&gt;

A minivan following the team bus carrying the match referee and umpires was also fired upon and the driver was killed.&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;  [[Simon Taufel]], [[Steve Davis (umpire)|Steve Davis]], [[Nadeem Ghauri]], [[Ahsan Raza]], umpires performance manager Peter Manuel, liaison officer Abdul Sami and ICC match referee [[Chris Broad]] were in this minivan.  The minivan was subsequently allegedly abandoned by security personnel and no bullets were fired by the security forces for twenty minutes. [[Chris Broad]] threw himself over and kept his hand on the chest of [[Ahsan Raza]] to slow down the profuse bleeding from a bullet injury.  A police officer who climbed into the minivan to seek cover drove the minivan to safety.

Security cameras captured footage of several gunmen carrying automatic weapons and backpacks, firing on the convoy from the Liberty Square roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/02/pakistan.srilanka.attack/ |title=6 dead in attack on Sri Lankan cricketers |date=3 March 2009 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2009-03-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306212512/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/02/pakistan.srilanka.attack/ |archivedate= 6 March 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later seen jogging up the street and escaping on motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/04/pakistan.srilanka.attack/|title=Pakistan hunts for cricket attack gunmen|date=4 March 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was broadcast around the world presenting pictures of the attacks.&lt;ref name="NYT_Mar03"/&gt;

Security officials in [[Pakistan]] told [[The Times]] that most of the two dozen people arrested in connection with the attacks belonged to [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]],  [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], outlawed militant groups with close links to [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5854505.ece Gunmen who attacked cricketers in Lahore 'had links to al-Qaeda'], [[The Times]], 2009-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Aqeel, who is  an activist of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, escaped a police raid on his home in [[Kahuta]] on 9 March 2009.&lt;ref name=lontimes&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5875297.ece Lahore attack 'mastermind' escapes police raid in Punjab], [[The Times]], 2009-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Also another gunman Zubair, aka Naik Mohammad, of Zubair, was arrested from Madina Colony, Walton Road in Lahore. He was a waiter at a hotel in Rawalpindi, when he was recruited by Sifullah. He went to [[Miram Shah]] and was trained in the use of different weapons.

Other accused including Samiullah, alias Ejaz of [[Nankana Sahib District|Nankana district]], Adnan, alias Sajjad, Ajmal alias Ahsaan, Farooq, Ameer of Punjab [[Taliban]], and Umer, alias Abdul Wahab of [[D. I. Khan]], were still at large.

The attack was planned at Tauheed Hotel, and a house rented for this purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The [[auto rickshaws]] used in the attack were purchased by Samiullah.

A secret investigative report has surfaced later prepared by the Additional Inspector General of the Crime Investigation Division, Punjab on 22 January 2009 outlining the potential threat to the Sri Lankan team.&lt;ref name="Sri Lankan team attack suspect held"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-police-track-mastermind-of-attack-on-lankan-cricket-team--il--04|title=Sri Lankan team attack suspect held|last=Dawn Staff Reporter |date=17 June 2009|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=2009-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090620151639/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-police-track-mastermind-of-attack-on-lankan-cricket-team--il--04| archivedate= 20 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2011 England riots''', more widely known as the '''London Riots''' were a series of [[riots]] between the 6th of August and 11 August 2011, when thousands of people rioted in cities and towns across [[England]], saw [[looting]], [[arson]], and mass deployment of police, and resulted in the deaths of five people.

Protests started in [[Tottenham]], [[London]], following the [[death of Mark Duggan]], a local man who was shot dead by police on 4 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14434318 |title=Riots in Tottenham after Mark Duggan shooting protest |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several violent clashes with police ensued, along with the destruction of police vehicles, a [[double-decker bus]] and many homes and businesses, thus rapidly gaining attention from the media. Overnight, looting took place in [[Tottenham Hale]] retail park and nearby [[Wood Green]]. The following days saw similar scenes in other parts of London, with the worst rioting taking place in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Brixton]], [[Walthamstow]], [[Peckham]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[Battersea]], [[Croydon]], [[Ealing]], [[Barking, London|Barking]], [[Woolwich]], [[Lewisham]] and [[East Ham]].

From 8 to 10 August, other towns and cities in England (including [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]], [[Leicester]], [[Derby]], [[Wolverhampton]], [[Northampton]], [[Nottingham]], [[West Bromwich]], [[Bristol]], [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]) saw what was described by the media as "copycat violence". [[Social media]] sites including [[Facebook]] also featured rumours of further disturbances or details surrounding known disturbances which were later proven to be inaccurate; for instance there were rumours of disturbances in the town of [[Dudley]] and at the nearby [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]], but no incidents in these areas were detected by police. Rumours of a hospital being targeted by rioters in Birmingham were also proven to be wrong, as were rumours of disturbances in the [[Heath Town]] district of Wolverhampton, which had witnessed a serious riot in May 1989.

By 10 August, more than 3,000 arrests had been made across England, with more than 1,000 people issued with criminal charges for various offences related to the riots.&lt;ref name=bbc15Aug/&gt; Initially, courts sat for extended hours. There were a total of 3,443 crimes across London that were linked to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/08/25/london-riots-more-than-2-000-people-arrested-over-disorder-115875-23371068/ |title=London riots: More than 2,000 people arrested over disorder |date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|8|15|alt=Along with the five deaths, at least 16 others were injured}} as a direct result of related violent acts. An estimated £200 million worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity – which in many cases was already struggling due to [[Great Recession|the recession]] – was significantly compromised.

The riots have generated significant ongoing debate among political, social and academic figures about the causes and context in which they happened. Attributions for the rioters' behaviour include such social factors such as racial tension, class tension, economic decline and the unemployment that it had brought, as well as individual factors like criminality, hooliganism, the breakdown of social morality and the development of gang culture.{{ref|&lt;ref name="cnn_figures"&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's rioters count cost of unrest as order restored|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/12/uk.riots|publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc15Aug&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14532532|title=England's week of riots|publisher=BBC News|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Tottenham riots: a peaceful protest, then suddenly all hell broke loose|work=The Guardian|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as protesters riot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/police-cars-attacked-tottenham-mark-duggan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=London|date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{main article|Death of Mark Duggan}}

On Thursday 4 August 2011, a police officer shot and killed 29-year-old Mark Duggan during an intelligence-led, targeted vehicle stop procedure on the Ferry Lane bridge next to [[Tottenham Hale station]].{{refn|&lt;ref name=bbc2nd /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-Mark-Duggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mark Duggan shooting: Bullets results 'within 24 hours'|publisher=BBC|date=8 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14443311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44091979/ns/world_news-europe|title=Soul searching lies ahead as UK riots cool|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) said that the planned arrest was part of [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]], which at that time investigated gun crime within the [[Black British|black community]].&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt; The incident had been referred to the IPCC,&lt;ref name=bbc2nd&gt;{{cite news|title=Man dead and police officer hurt in Tottenham shooting|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14412752|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is standard practice if death or serious injury follows police contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What does the IPCC do? |url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/what_do.aspx |publisher=Independent Police Complaints Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting, the media widely reported that a bullet was found embedded in a police radio, implying that Duggan fired on the police.&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt; Friends and relatives of Duggan said that he was unarmed. The police later revealed that initial [[ballistics]] tests on the bullet recovered from the police radio indicate that it was a "very distinct" police issue [[hollow-point bullet]].&lt;ref name=Laville07 &gt;{{cite news|title=Doubts emerge over Duggan shooting as London burns|author=Sandra Laville|author2=Paul Lewis|author3=Vikram Dodd|author4=Caroline Davies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/police-attack-london-burns|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-police-duggan-live#block-44|title=London disturbances – Sunday 7&amp;nbsp;August|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC later stated that a loaded [[Bruni Olympic .380 BBM|Bruni BBM]] [[Starting pistol|blank-firing pistol]], converted to fire live ammunition, was recovered from the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8699857/The-street-code-of-vengeance-that-sparked-the-riots.html|title=The street code of vengeance that sparked the riots|last=Lewis|first=Jason|date=13 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976974-no-evidence-that-mark-duggan-shot-at-police-says-ipcc.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919080804/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976974-no-evidence-that-mark-duggan-shot-at-police-says-ipcc.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2012 |title='No evidence' that Mark Duggan shot at police, says IPCC |date=10 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |accessdate=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/264057/UK-riots-Mark-Duggan-had-a-loaded-pistol-|title=UK RIOTS: MARK DUGGAN ‘HAD A LOADED PISTOL’|date=10 August 2011|work=Daily Express|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was wrapped in a sock and there was no evidence that it had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Independent Police Complaints Commission has just announced that there is no evidence|work=The Guardian|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/09/london-riots-day-four-live-blog#block-63|location=London|first1=Sam|last1=Jones|first2=Matt|last2=Wells|first3=Paul|last3=Owen|first4=Ben|last4=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August, the IPCC stated that Duggan did not open fire: "It seems possible that we may have verbally led journalists to [wrongly] believe that shots were exchanged". The bullet that had lodged in an officer's radio is believed to have been an [[overpenetration]], having passed through Duggan's body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mark-duggan-did-not-fire-his-weapon-at-police/story-e6frg6so-1226111938756 "Mark Duggan did not fire his weapon at police",] ''[[The Australian]]'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130111160854/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/193718.html "Media misled on Mark Duggan death",] [[Press TV]], 13 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At lunchtime on 6 August, a meeting was called by police between local community leaders, councillors and members of police advisory groups. In this meeting, police were warned several times that there could possibly be another riot similar to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] of 1985 if local concerns regarding the death were not addressed.&lt;ref name="channel4ex"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|publisher=Channel 4|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=19 August 2011|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/could-the-tottenham-riots-have-been-prevented}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcreport"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stephenson|first=Wesley|title=Tottenham police 'could have stopped riots'|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=25 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14646187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2014, a jury at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] concluded that Duggan was [[Lawful killing|lawfully killed]].

===Protest march===
On Saturday 6 August, a protest was held, initially peacefully, beginning at [[Broadwater Farm]] and finishing at Tottenham police station.&lt;ref name="bolesworth"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bolesworth|first=Sarah|author2=Barry Neild |author3=Peter Beaumont |author4=Paul Lewis |author5=Sandra Laville|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|work=The Observer|location=London|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/06/tottenham-riots-protesters-police}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Duggan to demand justice for the family.&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14423942|title=Tottenham police shooting: Dead man was minicab passenger|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/police-patrol-tottenham-after-riots|title=Tottenham riots are a disgrace, says MP|publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of some 300 people demanded that a senior local police officer come out to speak to them. When Chief Inspector Ade Adelekan arrived, he was met with boos and cries of "murderer", "[[Uncle Tom#Epithet|Uncle Tom]]" and "[[List of ethnic slurs#C|coconut]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-riots--one-year-on-owen-jones-commences-a-series-of-special-reports-7965142.html "London riots – one year on: Owen Jones commences a series of special reports", ''The Independent''], 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The crowd stayed in front of the police station hours longer than they originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. Rumours that a 16-year-old girl had sustained injuries after attacking police with a champagne bottle began circulating on social media. To date, the girl remains unidentified and the report unconfirmed. However the rumour alone was sufficient to further fuel tensions in the area.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/05/tottenham-riots-police-community "Tottenham riots: missteps in the dance of police and a frustrated community" by Hugh Muir], ''The Guardian'', 5 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tottenham riots August 6th.jpg|thumb|left|Rioters facing police on the evening of 6 August 2011]]
The morning of Monday 8 August was quiet, but by evening, areas across London were affected by widespread looting, arson and violence, with significant outbreaks in parts of Battersea, Brixton, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, East Ham, Hackney, Harrow, Lewisham, Peckham, Stratford, Waltham Forest, Woolwich, and Wood Green. A man was found shot in Croydon, and died later in hospital. Another man who had been assaulted in Ealing died in hospital on Thursday 11 August.

Similar riots were reported outside London – notably in Birmingham, Bristol, Gloucester, Gillingham and Nottingham.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Just the job to bring riots to capital? |date=18 August 2011 |work=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/opinion/Ross-Martin-Just-the-job.6820832.jp}}{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three men were killed in Birmingham in a hit-and-run incident related to the disturbances. Looting and violence continued in two locations around Manchester and Liverpool.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;

[[File:Barclays - 2011 London Looting.jpg|thumb|left|Bank workers in Walthamstow observe the destruction which was caused in the early hours of the morning]]
Throughout the rioting, many of the rioters failed to cover their faces. Some posed for pictures with stolen goods, posting them on social-networking sites.&lt;ref name="Tom de Castella &amp; Caroline McClatchey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14463452|title=UK riots: What turns people into looters?|accessdate=10 August 2011 | publisher=BBC News|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although London employs [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras to monitor crime and large events, reports indicate that citizen footage contributed more to capturing looters in action than the police force.&lt;ref name="London and England riots: CCTV Pictures"&gt;{{cite news|title=London and England riots: CCTV pictures of suspects are released by the police|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8690951/London-riots-CCTV-pictures-of-suspects-are-released-by-the-Metropolitan-Police.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the CCTV, looters were filmed and photographed with their faces visible. Police forces and investigators used websites like [[Flickr]] to find galleries of the looters to help solve and prevent cases of vandalism and further damage. [[Facebook]] pages were also created to identify looters.&lt;ref name="Citizen Cameras"&gt;{{cite web|last=Popkins|first=Helen|title=Citizen Cameras Capture more Looters than London Cops|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/citizen-cameras-capture-more-london-looters-cops-121801|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|accessdate=28 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420112134/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/citizen-cameras-capture-more-london-looters-cops-121801 |archivedate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liverpool Riots 2011 burnt cars.jpg|thumb|Burnt-out cars in [[Liverpool]].]]
Several interactive maps were implemented in the [[Google Maps]] website that showed satellite views of what was happening in the streets during the rioting. James Cridland, the managing director of the free media resources, created a Google Map that tracked verified locations of rioting.
[[Channel 4 News]] also had similar maps that progressively tracked the damage in the streets as well.&lt;ref name="Interactive Maps reveal satellite's view of UK Riots"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benedetti|first=Winda|title=Interactive maps reveal satellite's view of UK riots|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508151113/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|archivedate=8 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; News channels also were able to utilise this public service to capture live footage on the streets and inform citizens of dangerous or crowded areas.

===BlackBerry Messenger===
[[File:Croydon Riots 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Stand-off between rioters and police in Croydon]]
There were reports that the [[BlackBerry Messenger]] service was used by looters to organise their activities, and that inflammatory and inaccurate accounts of Mark Duggan's killing on social media sites may have incited disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-tottenham-duggan-blog#block-61 |title=London riots – live blog |author=Paul Lewis |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/08/london-riots-facebook-twitter-blackberry |title=London riots: how BlackBerry Messenger played a key role |author=Josh Halliday |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G8AUG2011/&gt; One of the many messages shared between users was the following:

[[File:Tottenham Riot-shops.jpg|thumb|A shop in Tottenham Hale Retail park after the looting]]
[[Research in Motion]] assisted British police in tracking rioters who used BBM, stating, "We comply with the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] and co-operate fully with the Home Office and UK police forces."&lt;ref name="garside1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garside|first=Juliette|title=UK riots: Mobile phone operators help police to identify looters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-mobile-phone-operators|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=9 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased connectivity among individuals has led to a greater ability to organise and execute massive gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jurgenson|first=N.|title=When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution|journal=Future Internet|year=2012|volume=4|pages=83–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not occurred only with the riots in England, but with other collective gatherings such as the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chebib|first=Nadine Kassem|author2=Sohail, Rabia Minatullah|title=The reasons social media contributed to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|year=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=139–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter===
Much like BBM, the mobility of technology shaped the London riots. During the Tottenham riots of 1985, citizens had to head into a public place to voice their message.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams, Lee|first=William|title=London Riots: Organized via Twitter and Smart phones?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2087337,00.html|work=Time|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, with access to [[Twitter]] as a communication medium, social media was used to rapidly spread messages of the riots.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

Radio 4 criticised Twitter's contribution to the riots through greed and criminality.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Olivia|title=London Riots: Twitter That Caused Them?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/08/08/london-riots-twitter-that_n_920791.html|publisher=The Huffington Post- Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' described Twitter as being an outlet for promoting gang violence.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; Evidence shows that Twitter is powerful because tweets of individuals were inspired by news content.&lt;ref name="Tonkin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tonkin |first=Emma |author2=Heather D. Pfeiffer |author3=Greg Tourte |title=Twitter, information sharing and the London riots |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]] |date=13 January 2012 |volume=38 |issue=2 |doi=10.1002/bult.2012.1720380212 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2012.1720380212/pdf |pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an article in ''Time'' magazine suggested BlackBerry Messenger was more to blame.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

During the riots, Twitter accounted for four out of every 170 UK Internet visits on Monday 8 August. In addition, citizens also used Twitter to band together, after the destruction.
The aftermath of the riots resulted in a disrupted city, yet Twitter was further used to maintain peace, with hashtags including "#riotcleanup".&lt;ref name="Tonkin"/&gt; Evidence shows that people were tweeting and re-tweeting news related to the riots, not original content.&lt;ref name="Tonkin"/&gt;

===Mobile phones===
Other than BlackBerry Messenger and social networking sites, mobile phone operators T-Mobile and Orange prioritised police requests for information about the phones that were used to plan the riots that hit British cities. Under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]], phone companies were required to hand over data about the locations calls were made from, the owners of phones, and lists of calls made to and from a particular handset.&lt;ref name="garside1"/&gt;

==Effects==

====Richard Mannington Bowes====
[[File:Springbridge Mews floral tributes.jpg|thumb|right|Floral tributes at the site of the fatal assault. The flowers at the top spell out the word "why".]]
A 68-year-old man, Richard Mannington Bowes, died on 11 August after he was attacked while attempting to stamp out a litter-bin fire in [[Ealing]] on the evening of 8 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ealing riot: Richard Mannington Bowes dies after attack|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14500869|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowes was attacked by members of a mob on 8 August 2011, while attempting to extinguish a fire that had been [[arson|deliberately started]] in industrial bins on Spring Bridge Road. The attack inflicted severe head injuries which resulted in a coma. The assault was caught on [[CCTV]] and reportedly filmed on mobile phones by associates of the alleged assailant.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3750093/Fire-rages-around-riot-hero-Richard-Bowes.html "He paid a terrible price: Fire rages around riot hero"] by Anthony Price, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. Retrieved 13 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but due to the number of rioters they were unable to come to his aid until riot squad officers pushed back the rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes.
A line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived. Bowes' wallet and phone had been stolen, and police faced difficulty in identifying him. He died of his injuries at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] on 11 August 2011 after being removed from life support.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14500869 "Riots: Arrest over death of Richard Mannington Bowes"] [[BBC News]].

In a strongly worded criticism of what he deems to be a misplaced "hyper-sensitivity about race", dating back to the [[Macpherson Report]] of 1999, [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] director David Green attributed the reluctance by police to use force to a fear of disciplinary action.

''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called the scenes "shameful" and lamented that "[w]ith the London Olympics less than a year away, our reputation is being damaged at the worst moment".

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s editorial said: "What we have experienced in London and elsewhere since Saturday night is a wholly new phenomenon: violent disorder whose sole intent is criminal...

''[[The Guardian]]'' called on the public to back the police: "... Britain's 2011 riots have become a defining contest between disorder and order. In that contest, important caveats notwithstanding, there is only one right side to be on. The attacks, the destruction, the criminality and the reign of fear must be stopped. The rule of law in the cities of Britain must not only be defended against delinquent destruction. It must also be enforced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban riots: The battle for the streets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/09/urban-riots-battle-streets-editorial|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the height of the riots, ''The Guardian'' was accused of anti-Semitic incitement by the media monitoring organisation, Comment Is Free Watch (CiFW), after Guardian journalist Paul Lewis singled out [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] residents who were not involved in the rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardian report on London riots omits the race or ethnicity of rioters – but, still mentions Jews|url=http://cifwatch.com/2011/08/08/guardian-report-on-london-riots-omits-the-race-or-ethnicity-of-rioters-but-still-mentions-jews/|publisher=CiF Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of his report stated, "The make-up of the rioters was racially mixed. Most were men or boys, some apparently as young as 10….But families and other local residents, including some from Tottenham's Hasidic Jewish community, also gathered to watch and jeer at police." CIFW responded by condemning the newspaper saying, "A 1,800 Guardian report doesn't mention the race, ethnicity, or religion of the rioters, somehow found it pertinent to note that some of those who gathered to jeer police were, allegedly, Hasidic Jews." As a result of the negative publicity, ''The Guardian'' revised the story.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Guardian revises story about UK Riots which singled out Hasidic Jews|url=http://cifwatch.com/2011/08/09/the-guardian-revises-story-about-uk-riots-which-singled-out-hasidic-jews/|publisher=CiF Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 9 August leading article, ''[[The Independent]]'' said the police's handling of [[death of Mark Duggan|Mark Duggan's death]] "looks to have been poor", and that there is "context of mistrust of the police here." The paper added that "it is spurious to draw a connection between that disaffection [by the inner-city youth] and specific outbreaks of violence of the sort we have seen in recent days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leading article: The lessons to be drawn from mindless violence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-the-lessons-to-be-drawn-from-mindless-violence-2333987.html|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Hitchens]] of ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' disputed the idea that the events were riots on the basis that they were fundamentally apolitical. He further stated: "This is an equal-opportunity crime wave. The lawbreakers are not from any distinct ethnic group, and attempts to explain this behaviour on these ground are baseless and poisonous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2011/08/radio-silence.html|title=Radio Silence – Mail Online – Peter Hitchens blog|publisher=Hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote an opinion piece for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', in which he blamed the "sense of entitlement" that he sees as being common among Britain's youth as a cause for the riots, and said that British youth are today among "the most unpleasant and violent in the world" as a result.&lt;ref name="ny_daniels"&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Anthony|title=Behind England's riots, a violent and entitled generation of British young people|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2011/08/10/2011-08-10_behind_englands_riots_a_violent_and_entitled_generation_of_british_young_people.html|work=Daily News|accessdate=12 August 2011|authorlink=Theodore Dalrymple |location=New York |date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Race relations====
The ethnic makeup of the rioters varied in different cities: 76% of those arrested in Manchester were white, while 29% were white and 39% black in London, and the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] was the only area where more than 6% were Asian.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Richard Phillips; Frost, Diane; and Singleton, Alex (March 2013).

&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been much speculation about the causes and meanings of the riots that swept through English cities in August 2011...&lt;p&gt;"These disturbances began on 6 August following the police shooting of Mark Duggan, a black resident of Tottenham, North London.

The effects of [[black people|black culture]] were discussed by historian [[David Starkey]] in the edition of the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' TV programme of 12 August.

The author [[Dreda Say Mitchell]] countered his argument by saying that there is no one single "black culture".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14513517|title='The whites have become black' says David Starkey|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators remarked on the apparently high proportion of black people involved in the riots and took the view that there was a disproportionately high number of rioters who were black, compared to the overall demographics of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="economist-black community"&gt;{{cite news|title=A reckoning – The black community wrestles with the causes of the riots|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528285|work=The Economist|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ministry of Justice has admitted "the group of people brought before the courts is only a subset of all people who took part in the public disorder". In February 2012 a report was published by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] providing demographic statistics of the people charged over participation the riots up to 1 February 2012 which revealed that 41% of those brought before the courts identified themselves as being from the White group, 39% from the Black ethnic group, 12% from the Mixed ethnic group, 6% the Asian ethnic group, and 2% the Other ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical bulletin on the public disorder of 6 to 9 August 2011 – February update&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were disproportionate to the [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|average UK population]];&lt;ref name="ethnicity-moj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical bulletin on the public disorder of 6th–9th August 2011 full report|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/statistics/criminal-justice-stats/august-public-disorder-stats-bulletin-230212.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=24 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219082623/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217805/august-public-disorder-stats-bulletin-230212.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnicity-sky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gangs Had No 'Pivotal Role' In English Riots|url=http://news.sky.com/home/article/16095055|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=13 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122926/http://news.sky.com/home/article/16095055 |archivedate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the figures revealed varying demographics in different areas when compared to local populations. For example, in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], the figures revealed that 55% of defendants in court over riot-related charges were black, compared to a 17% black population; in [[City of Salford|Salford]], 94% of rioters in court were white, compared to an 88% white population, and 6% of rioters were black, compared to a 2% black population.&lt;ref name="ethnicity-bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=England rioters 'poorer, younger, less educated'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15426720|accessdate=13 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, looters from 44 foreign countries were jailed, with Jamaicans representing the largest group.&lt;ref name="ethnicity-star"&gt;{{cite web|title=YOBS NOT TOO ILL TO LOOT|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/217426/Yobs-not-too-ill-to-loot/|work=Daily Star|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Justice report also noted that rioters brought before the courts were disproportionately male (89%) and young (53% were aged 20 or under, with the number of "[[Minor (law)|juveniles]]" ranging from 26% in London to 39% in [[Merseyside]], and very few listed as over 40).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866 BBC News: "England riots: Who's been prosecuted?"], quoting [[Ministry of Justice]] statistics from June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Independent'', the costs to the Metropolitan Police of policing the disorder and disturbances in London are expected to exceed £34 million.
This could be more than their total bill for the policing of all major public disorder events in the year from April 2010 to March 2011.&lt;ref name=I30AUG2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Riots to cost Met police £34m |date=30 August 2011 |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/riots-to-cost-met-police-34m-2346117.html |accessdate=3 September 2011 |location=London |first=Wesley |last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trials and sentencing====
On 1 September 2011 the BBC reported that official [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] figures showed that of the 1,566 people that had appeared before magistrates on charges connected with the disorder, 1,027 had been in London, 190 in Greater Manchester, 132 in the West Midlands, 67 in Merseyside and 64 in Nottingham.&lt;ref name=BBC1SEP2011&gt;{{cite news |title=England riots: Court appearance total rises above 1,500 |date=1 September 2011 |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14746229 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving the judgment of the court, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]], sitting with Sir John Thomas and [[Brian Leveson|Lord Justice Leveson]], stated that there is "an overwhelming obligation on sentencing courts to do what they can to ensure the protection of the public", that "the imposition of severe sentences, intended to provide both punishment and deterrence, must follow" and that "[t]hose who deliberately participate in disturbances of this magnitude, causing injury and damage and fear to even the most stout-hearted of citizens, and who individually commit further crimes during the course of the riots are committing aggravated crimes". The appeals were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Blackshaw, R. v (Rev 1) [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2011/2312.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2011]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Crim 2312,] 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2012, the Court of Appeal (Lord Judge CJ, [[Peter Openshaw|Openshaw]] &amp; Irwin [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|JJ]]) increased the sentence imposed by the Crown Court at Inner London on Adam Ahmadzai from four years detention to seven years detention for offences of violent disorder, robbery, burglary and criminal damage committed during the riots on 8 August 2011, after a reference from [[Attorney General of England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Dominic Grieve]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17844425 "London riots: Croydon rioter's jail term extended"], BBC News, (25 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chief Justice stated that the offences were of the "greatest possible seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Theatrical===
[[Tricycle Theatre|The Tricycle Theatre]] in Kilburn presented a piece of new writing, ''[[The Riots (2011 play)|The Riots]]'' by [[Gillian Slovo]], which looked into the events over those days in August and the thoughts and opinions of a range of people directly involved and politicians. It transferred to the [[Bernie Grant Arts Centre]] in Tottenham, about 400 m from where the Mark Duggan protest took place, on 5 January 2012, and was due to run until 15 January.
The piece attempts to show a non-biased look into the events, allowing audience members to hear different views into why it happened and what could have and should now be done. The piece includes community leaders Stafford Scott and Martin Sylvester Brown, police constables on duty that night and a former resident of the Carpet-Right building, the burned remains now providing a highly poignant reminder of the events.
They are combined with the views of [[Diane Abbott]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Michael Gove]] and Pastor Nims Obunge. It was received well by all critics, with 4 stars from all major press including ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/23/the-riots-tricycle-review "The Riots – review"].

Australian mod rock band [[The Feldons]] reference the riots in their song London Town from their 2012 album ''Goody Hallett and Other Stories''.

==Suggested contributory factors==
The causes of the 2011 England riots both immediate and long-term have been the subject of media and academic debate. Several speculations have emerged as to what the likely contributory factors might be for the riots; from [[socio-economic]] causes focusing on unemployment and spending cuts, as well as [[social media]], [[gang culture]] and criminal opportunism. The House of Commons Home Affairs select committee will begin examining the police response to the riots in late 2011.
The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the Opposition]], [[Ed Miliband]], called for a public inquiry into the wider causes of the riots and has stated that his party would set up such an inquiry if the coalition fails to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Patrick Wintour, political editor, and James Meikle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/12/ed-miliband-links-riots-scandals|title=Ed Miliband promises riots inquiry|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK was shaken by its worst riots in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/9184613.UK_shaken_by_worst_riots_in_decades/?ref=rss |title=UK shaken by worst riots in decades (from ''Hounslow And Brentford Times'') |publisher=Hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412191316/http://www.hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/9184613.UK_shaken_by_worst_riots_in_decades/?ref=rss |archivedate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide-ranging [[London School of Economics|LSE]] study called ''Reading the Riots'' concluded that the major contributory factors were opportunism, perceived social injustice, deprivation, and frustration at the way communities were policed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Introducing phase two of Reading the Riots: police, victims and the courts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/01/introducing-phase-two-reading-riots|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 July 2012|location=London|first1=Paul|last1=Lewis|first2=Tim|last2=Newburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[YouGov]] poll was carried out on 8–9 August 2011 for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' asking what those surveyed believed to be the main cause of the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-pol-sun-riots-100811.pdf|title=YouGov/The Sun Survey Results|date=8–9 August 2011|work=today.yougov.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110811031843/http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-pol-sun-riots-100811.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, 42% of those polled thought "criminal behaviour" to be the main cause, whilst 26% thought "gang culture" was, 8% thought "government cuts" were, 5% thought "unemployment" was, 5% thought "racial tensions" was and 3% thought "poor policing" was. In a [[ComRes]] poll for the ''Sunday Mirror'' and ''Independent on Sunday'', in which the question was "do you agree or disagree with these statements about the recent riots?", 90% of those polled agreed that the "Police should be allowed {{sic|use|reason="to use water cannon" would be expected}} to water cannon to disperse rioters", 90% agreed that "There is no excuse whatsoever for the violent rioting and looting over the last few days", 61% agreed that "Government ministers failed to return to their desks quickly enough from holidays" and 50% agreed that "The Government's response to the economic crisis (e.g. cuts to services, unemployment, reduced education funding) is helping fuel the rioters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/Ios_SM_LondonRiots_12thAugust11.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017193956/http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/Ios_SM_LondonRiots_12thAugust11.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 October 2012 |title=London Riots Survey |publisher=ComRes |accessdate=29 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who study the causes of political instability suggest that the critical common factor is the density of youths. A nation's extent of political unrest, i.e. its vulnerability to riot, war or regime change, is directly associated with the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds in its population.
They argue that communities with more than 20% of individuals in this age group run the greatest risk of more frequent and more intense political instability. They describe the phenomena as the "[[Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]", where the "bulge" refers to the fattening of the population pyramid just before the base of the youngest age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |title=On riots and youth bulges |work=Significance Magazine |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415203106/http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |archivedate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor relations with the police===
The riots in Tottenham after the death of Mark Duggan were initially blamed on poor relations between the police and the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Peter|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14436529|title=London riots: Tensions behind unrest revealed|publisher=BBC|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 1,000 Arrested in U.K. as Anger over Inequality, Racism Boils Over into Insurrection|date=10 August 2011|first=Richard|last=Seymour|publisher= DemocracyNow.com|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/10/over_1_000_arrested_in_uk|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Gus John]] has argued that the tactical use of frequent "[[stop and search]]", particularly of young black men, has caused resentment of the police in the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZ67UWu3mGjnb3TfN-jVwN77VevQ?docId=CNG.1dbda76336400d092358c2558c36e01d.4e1 |author=Guy Jackson|title=AFP: Depraved or deprived?

According to [[David Lammy]], the MP for Tottenham, the "cracks that already existed between the police and the community became deep fissures".&lt;ref name=lammy /&gt;&lt;ref name="polcl"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK riots: political classes see what they want to see|first=Aditya|last=Chakrabortty|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2011|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/10/uk-riots-political-classes|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian''{{'s}} Reading the Riots Survey concluded: "Although rioters expressed a mix of opinions about the disorder, many of those involved said they felt like they were participating in explicitly anti-police riots. They cited 'policing' as the most significant cause of the riots, and anger over the police shooting of Mark Duggan, which triggered initial disturbances in Tottenham, was repeatedly mentioned – even outside London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/05/anger-police-fuelled-riots-study | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Paul | last1=Lewis | first2=Tim | last2=Newburn | first3=Matthew | last3=Taylor | first4=James | last4=Ball | title=Rioters say anger with police fuelled summer unrest | date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social exclusion===
Rioters themselves cited exclusion as a reason for their actions. One person, asked by a journalist if rioting was really the best way to accomplish their objectives, responded: "Yes, because if we weren’t rioting, you wouldn’t be talking to us."&lt;ref name=DN10Aug&gt;Richard Seymour, [[Darcus Howe]], and [[Amy Goodman]], [http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/10/over_1_000_arrested_in_uk "Over 1,000 Arrested in U.K. as Anger over Inequality, Racism Boils Over into 'Insurrection'"], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camila Batmanghelidjh]] writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' blames [[social exclusion]] and [[social deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/camila-batmanghelidjh-caring-costs-ndash-but-so-do-riots-2333991.html|title=Camila Batmanghelidjh: Caring costs – but so do riots – Commentators, Opinion|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various journalists have identified poverty and the [[Economic inequality|growing gap between rich and poor]] as causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Topping| first = Alexandra|title=Looting 'fuelled by social exclusion' |work=The Guardian|date=8 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/looting-fuelled-by-social-exclusion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Ross|first=Monique|title=Blame for riots turns to UK social system|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 August 2011|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-10/society-role-in-london-riots/2833168?section=world}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English riots: The return of the underclass|date=11 August 2011|first=Mark|last=Easton|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14488486|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a House of Commons debate on the riots Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] stated that the riots were symptomatic of a "wider malaise" including worklessness, illiteracy, and drug abuse but also stated that "Everybody, no matter what their background or circumstances, has the freedom to choose between right and wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9560000/9560113.stm|title=BBC – Democracy Live – In full: MPss debate England riots|publisher=BBC News|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], writing in ''The Observer'', stated that the riots were not caused by a broken society, but due to a group of young, alienated, disaffected youth who are outside the social mainstream and who live in a culture at odds with any canons of proper behaviour; he added that this is found in virtually every developed nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=Riots Not Caused By Broken Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/20/tony-blair-riots-crime-family|accessdate=21 August 2011|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Hastings]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' blamed a culture of welfare dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Max Hastings|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2024284/UK-riots-2011-Liberal-dogma-spawned-generation-brutalised-youths.html|title=UK riots 2011: Liberal dogma has spawned a generation of brutalised youths|work=Daily Mail|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A journalist on Al Jazeera suggested a similarity to the disenfranchisement behind the [[Arab Spring]] [[revolutionary wave]] of 2011. Links were made to high youth unemployment and general disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/08/2011811122931660627.html | title=From the Arab Spring to Liverpool? | work=Aljazeera | date=11 August 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Yasmin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by The ''[[Financial Times]]'' published in September 2011 found a strong link between rioting and deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/236110aa-d716-11e0-bc73-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1X3nspCJu|title= Rioting link to deprivation revealed|work= [[Financial Times]]|author1=Sally Gainsbury  |author2=Natasha Culzac|date = 4 September 2011|accessdate= 5 September 2011}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family breakdown===
[[Christina Odone]] writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' links the riots to a lack of male role models and argues that "Like the overwhelming majority of youth offenders behind bars, these gang members have one thing in common: no father at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Odone|first=Cristina|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100100154/london-riots-absent-fathers-have-a-lot-to-answer-for|title=London riots: Absent fathers have a lot to answer for|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked further with England's having the "worst record in family breakdown in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rioters Are NOT 'Scum'!

===Government cuts===
The spending cuts of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government in the United Kingdom]] have also been cited as a cause.{{refn|&lt;ref name="polcl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/08/uk-britain-disorder-idUKTRE7752QX20110808|title= Riots spread on third night of violence|last1=Hemming|first1=Jon|last2=Ambrogi|first2=Stefano |date=8 August 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Croft |first=Adrian |title=Spending cuts, police blamed for London riot |page=B4 |newspaper=The Vancouver Sun |date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44055812/ns/world_news-europe|title=More than 200 thugs arrested in London riots|publisher=MSN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlammy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm|author=David Lammy|title=Tottenham riot: The lesson of Broadwater Farm|date=7 August 2011|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Somaiya|first=Ravi|title=London Sees Twin Perils Converging to Fuel Riot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/world/europe/08britain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ken Livingstone, the Labour Candidate for Mayor of London in 2012 has argued that "The economic stagnation and cuts being imposed by the Tory government inevitably create social division."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labourlist.org/ken-livingstone-statement-on-tottenham-riots|title=Ken Livingstone statement on Tottenham riots|publisher=LabourList.org|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328123039/http://labourlist.org/2011/08/ken-livingstone-statement-on-tottenham-riots/ |archivedate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Clegg, the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats political party]], made it clear that the government's planned cuts to police budgets will go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Meikle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/11/nick-clegg-police-funding-cuts-riots|title=Nick Clegg: police funding cuts will not change despite riots|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local government budget had been cut in the past year so Haringey Council, which includes [[Tottenham]] and [[Tottenham Hale]], decided to close eight of its 13 youth clubs in 2011, rather than save money through increased efficiency or make cuts in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/rolling-back-the-state-only-fans-the-flames-16037110.html#ixzz1VH2JqmoJ |title=Rolling back the state only fans the flames |work=The Belfast Telegraph |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/13/hackney-riots-youth-clubs-closure?intcmp=239 "Hackney riots: 'The message when youth clubs close is that no one cares'"], ''The Observer''. Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrapping of the [[Education Maintenance Allowance]], removing of funding for courses where the student already has an equal or lower level qualification and trebling of university tuition fees, combined with high youth unemployment has placed the British youth "between a rock and a hard place" alienating and angering the youth population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Young people have no right to riot, but they have a right to be angry|last=Lloyd|first=Saci|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/18/riot-young-people-a-level-school|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this argument say that Scottish youth did not riot partly because Scottish students do not have to pay tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A society that is slipping into Dickensian darkness|last=Macwhirter|first=Iain |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/iain-macwhirter/a-society-that-is-slipping-into-dickensian-darkness-1.1118346|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow |date=18 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930190349/http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/a-society-that-is-slipping-into-dickensian-darkness.14772416 |archivedate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rioting for fun===

Other academics have pointed to more prosaic causes of the 2011 riots, citing the [[carnivalesque]] atmospheres created through the usual uses of urban space. For example, researchers from the [[University of Birmingham]] noted that ‘another sound could be heard above the mêlée, that of laughter. Above the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of the throng, were smiles, laughter, and shrieks of joy.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxyd.bham.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/09627251.2012.670998 "Panic on the streets of Birmingham? Struggles over space and belonging in the Revanchist City"], in ''Justice Matters'', Vol. 87, No. 1 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gang culture===
In a ''[[Newsnight]]'' discussion on 12 August, historian [[David Starkey]] blamed black gangster culture, saying that it had influenced youths of all races.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The BBC received nearly 700 complaints about his statement that the "whites have become black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14542240 | publisher=BBC News | title=Hundreds complain about David Starkey's race comments | date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cottrell-Boyce, writing in the Youth Justice journal, argued that gangs were constructed as a 'suitable enemy' by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural and economic roots of youth violence.&lt;ref name="Cottrell-Boyce"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cottrell-Boyce|first=Joseph|title=Ending Gang and Youth Violence: A Critique|journal=Youth Justice|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–206|url=http://yjj.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193.abstract|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal opportunism===
During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] said: "I think this is about sheer criminality. That is what we have seen on the streets. The violence we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rioting spirals out of control |date=8 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120604014910/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots "recreational violence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK riots: 16,000 police on London streets|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698|date=9 August 2011|work=TVNZ|accessdate=9 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811182640/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698 |archivedate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9572763.stm|title= Rioters revel in thrill of seizing Manchester streets|publisher=BBC News - ''Newsnight|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported that the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police had stated that he thought that the motivation for rioters targeting the city centre was not anger, but greed.&lt;ref name="greed"&gt;{{cite news |title=How rioting spread around England |publisher=BBC News |date=9 August 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14466477 |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral decay at the top===
''Daily Telegraph'' columnist [[Peter Oborne]] suggested that moral decay is just as bad at the top of society as it is at the bottom, with the rich and powerful generating anger among the British population. He cited the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|MPs' expenses scandal]], [[bankers' bonuses]], and [[News International phone hacking scandal|the phone hacking scandal]] as setting poor examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The moral decay of our society is as bad at the top as the bottom |last=Oborne |first=Peter |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100100708/the-moral-decay-of-our-society-is-as-bad-at-the-top-as-the-bottom|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Financial Times]]'' cartoonist Ingram Pinn depicted a Union Flag being broken through by a looter in a [[hoodie]] carrying a stolen box of Adidas trainers, preceded by two men in suits carrying piles of cash, one saying "MP's Expenses" and another "Banker's Bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domesticempire.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/broken-britain-riots/ "Broken Britain Riots"], 16 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of the penal system===
[[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]], writing in ''The Guardian'', described the riots in part as "an outburst of outrageous behaviour by the criminal classes". He drew attention to the statistic that almost three-quarters of the adults who had been charged with offences related to the disorder already had a criminal record.
Clarke characterised this as the legacy of "a broken penal system", one that did not have a good record for preventing reoffending. He stated he is proposing radical new measures intended to focus on robust punishment and on delivering reductions in reoffending.&lt;ref name=G5SEP2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Punish the feral rioters, but address our social deficit too |author=Kenneth Clarke |date=5 September 2011 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/05/punishment-rioters-help |accessdate=6 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream media relationship with the communities===
A conference held in November 2012 and its subsequent report by Dr Leah Bassel of the [[University of Leicester]], entitled ''Media and the Riots – A Call For Action'', examined the relationship between mainstream media and communities affected by the riots.{{vague|date=October 2013}}{{elucidate|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade, , [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jul/31/london-riots-universityofleicester "What the media did wrong in the riots – and how to put it right"], Greenslade Blog, ''The Guardian'', 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Wadsworth]], [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/media-coverage-2011-riots-was-disgraceful "Media Coverage Of 2011 Riots 'Was Disgraceful'"], ''The Voice'', 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-latest.com/riots-and-media-report "Special report about media and the riots"], The-Latest.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity involvement==
[[Jamie Waylett]], who played Vincent Crabbe in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, was charged and sentenced for his participation in the riots.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-17449630|title=London riots: Harry Potter actor Jamie Waylett jailed|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was photographed drinking out of a bottle of stolen champagne, as well as holding a petrol bomb in Camden on the third day of rioting and violence.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; He was given a two-year sentence for violence and [[handling stolen goods]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

'''AS Long As Possible (ASLAP)''' (2015-2017) is a visual art work by [[Finland|Finnish]] artist Juha van Ingen, consisting of a 1000-year long [[GIF]] animation loop.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/finnish-artists-create-1000-year-long-gif-titled-as-long-as-possible/|title=Finnish Artists Create 1000-year-long GIF Titled As Long As Possible|date=September 26, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at Kiasma National Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki on 28 March 2017. The animation is created in collaboration with developer and sound artist Janne Särkelä.&lt;ref name=KUMU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kumu.ekm.ee/en/syndmus/conductors-of-colour-music-modesty-and-modernity/|title=Conductors of Colour. Music, Modesty and Modernity|publisher=Art Museum of Estonia|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
ASLAP belongs to a group of art works where extreme duration is an essential part of the concept, like for instance Canadian artist [[Rodney Graham]]'s [[Parsifal]] (1882—38,969,364,735) based on a musical score by [[Richard Wagner]]'s assistant [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], a work that was initiated in 1990 and in theory is playing for another 39 billion years – three times longer than the estimated age of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="ARS17"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hello world! Art After the Internet|publisher=Helsinki: Kansalisgalleria - Finnish National Gallery, A Museum of Contemporary Art Publication| date=2017|url=https://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_9977137134303681|pages=96-99|isbn=9527067421|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other well known examples are [[Longplayer]] by [[Jem Finer]] (of [[the Pogues]]) sounding from the [[Trinity Buoy Wharf|Trinity Buoy]] lighthouse near [[Canary Wharf]] in [[London]] and the yet to be realised 10,000-year [[Clock of the Long Now]] by the [[Long Now Foundation]] in USA.&lt;ref name="ARS17"/&gt;

==AS Long As Possible (ASLAP)==
The work is developed as a [[GIF]] animation, with each frame lasting 655090 milliseconds, which is approximately 10,5 minutes. The total number of frames is 48 140 288&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop |first=Rollin |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/web/a17442/1000-year-gif/ |title=There Is Now a GIF Will Take 1,000 Years to Loop Once |publisher=Popularmechanics.com |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the duration of the animation 1000 years.&lt;ref name=Kiasma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arsguide.kiasma.fi/en/artwork/aslap-as-long-as-possible/|title=Juha van Ingen: ASLAP (AS Long As Possible)|publisher=Kiasma|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GIF file contains a loop function which will automatically, after the last frame has played, start the animation all over. ASLAP is intended to continue to play for ever.&lt;ref name=Voon&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/237627/the-1000-year-gif/|title=The 1,000-Year GIF|publisher=Hyperallergic Media Inc.|last=Voon|first=Claire|date=September 21, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animation was developed in 2015, and premiered at [[Kiasma]] Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 2017, coinciding with the 30 year anniversary of the [[GIF]] format.&lt;ref name=KUMU/&gt; ASLAP was presented in the context of ARS 17: [["Hello, World!" program|”Hello World”]], a major exhibition of international [[contemporary art]] on the theme of [[postinternet]] art.&lt;ref name="ARS17"/&gt;

The name of ASLAP is homage to the musical composition [[As Slow as Possible|ORGAN²/ASLSP]] (1987) by [[John Cage]] which is currently played on the church organ of St. Burchardi church in [[Halberstadt]] in [[Germany]] since its premiere in 2001, and will continue to play for the next 639 years. The abbreviation of Cage's composition includes an instruction to the performer of the piece on how to perform the work: As SLow aS Possible.&lt;ref name=ASLAP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aslongaspossible.com|title=As Long As Possible|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintenance of the artwork ==
The ASLAP file is cloned and it will simultaneously run on six physical playback units at different geographical locations.&lt;ref name=Next&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/eu/2017/04/12/finnish-museum-commits-to-playing-a-1000-year-long-gif-to-the-bitter-end/#.tnw_X5nlXWIs|title=Finnish Museum Commits to Playing a 1,000 Year Long GIF to the Bitter End |last=MAACK|first=MÁR MÁSSON |date=April 12, 2017|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one unit is destroyed for any reason, or when it needs to be technically upgraded, a new physical unit is built and the animation file is cloned and synchronised with the remaining units. If all of the playback units are destroyed the file is to be reconstructed from special [[time capsules]] that contain the description of the artwork, the specifications of the GIF format, the original GIF file and necessary documents including a printed copy of the code for generating a new file.&lt;ref name=Next/&gt;

The first ASLAP play back unit is included in the collection of The [[Finnish National Gallery]] and is playing and stored in [[Helsinki]]. The Finnish National Gallery has agreed to keep the animation playing until 3017.&lt;ref name=Next/&gt; 

The first time capsule was deposited 18 March 2017 into the [[Kumu (museum)|Kumu]] [[Art Museum of Estonia]] collection and is permanently stored in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref name=ASLAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Next/&gt;

== Presentation of ASLAP in ARS17==
Apart from the projected image of the ASLAP animation, the art work as presented by [[Kiasma]] included a player programmed by Jani Lindqvist, a computer, and a stainless steel box to protect the file and equipment through its life time. The installation also contained three digital prints of ASLAP frames and the printed binary code of the ASLAP GIF-file, frames 1 - 40100.&lt;ref name=ASLAP/&gt;

'''Ambivalence'''&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; is a state of having simultaneous conflicting reactions, beliefs, or feelings towards some object.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Collegiate Dictionary'', 3rd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = K.

Although attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent. The less certain an individual is in their attitude, the more impressionable it becomes, hence making future actions less predictable and/or less decisive.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=377|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence|date = March 16, 2010|accessdate = October 28, 2014|website = Psycholopedia|publisher = Psych-it.com.au|last = Moss|first = Dr. Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambivalent attitudes are also more susceptible to transient information (e.g., mood), which can result in a more malleable evaluation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = D.

For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Types of attitudinal ambivalence ==

=== Felt ambivalence ===
The psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  One, often called '''subjective ambivalence''' or felt ambivalence, represents the [[Subjective experience|psychological experience]] of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let's not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 361-386). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103114000134|title = Wanting other attitudes: Actual-desired attitude discrepancies predict feelings of ambivalence and ambivalence consequences|author1=DeMarree K.G. |author2=Wheeler S.C. |author3=Brinol P. |author4=Petty R.E. |date = July 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2014.02.001|pmid =|volume=53|pages=5–18|hdl = 10486/666333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Subjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct [[self-report]] measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Attitudes and Attitude Change: Attitudinal Ambivalence|author1=Conner M |author2=Armitage C.J. |publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = 261–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted ''of'' my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be [[Metacognition|metacognitive]]. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.

Priester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced "no conflict at all") to 10 (as in the subject experienced "maximum conflict").&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Potential ambivalence ===
Another measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called '''objective ambivalence''' or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Objective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.

Kaplan initially operationalized ambivalence as the lesser of the two reactions (i.e., positive or negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).

&lt;u&gt;Kaplan's measure yields the formula&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = S+L - |S-L|=S&lt;/math&gt;

Here, S is representative of the smaller rating or reaction, and the L is representative of the larger rating or reaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

However, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/47/6/1191/|title = Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude|author= Breckler, Steven J.|date = 1984|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = November 12, 2014|doi =10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191 |pmid =|volume=47|issue = 6|pages=1191–1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three conditions are as follows:
# If the larger value is maintained, while the smaller rating increases, ambivalence will increase. 
# If the smaller value is maintained, while the larger rating increases, ambivalence will decrease.
# If both the larger and smaller values are the same, ambivalence will increase when both ratings increase (as the difference between the two will increase) or decrease as the values decrease.
&lt;u&gt;Thompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence= (S+L)/2-|S-L|&lt;/math&gt;

The creation of this formula was pivotal because it accounts for both subjective and objective ratings.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Predictors of felt ambivalence ===
Research has shown only a moderate [[correlation]] between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scope of Social Psychology: Theory and Applications (A Festschrift for Wolfgang Stroebe)|authors = Jonas, K., &amp; Ziegler, R.|publisher = Psychology|year = 2007|isbn = 9781135419745|location = |pages = 32–34|title-link = Wolfgang Stroebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.

There are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: ''simultaneous accessibility'' and ''preference for consistency''.

'''Simultaneous accessibility''' is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Preference for consistency''' uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.

== Dimensions of attitudinal assessment as applied to ambivalence   ==

=== One-dimensional perspective ===
Traditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a [[Love hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Attitudes and Attitude Change|author1=Maio, Gregory |author2=Haddock, Geoffrey |publisher = Sage Publications Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-4129-2974-5|location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect  how attitudes function and are experienced.

=== Two-dimensional perspective ===
The two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone.  These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.

=== Multidimensional perspective ===
The Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.

Continued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however it should be noted that the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding
them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they  will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.

=== Meta-cognitive model ===
Not all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that [[meta-cognition]] has to do with "knowing about knowing." The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petty, P.E., Brinol, P., DeMarree, K. (2007). The
meta-cognitive model of attitudes: Implications for Attitude measurement,
change, and strength. [[Attitude (psychology)|Social Cognition.]]Vol 25, No. 5, 662, p.[[Attitude (psychology)|657-686]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consistency theories and ambivalence ==

=== Overview ===
Cognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the ''perceived ''[[paradoxical]] state itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Balance theory ===
[[Fritz Heider]] established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; [[balance theory]] seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. [[Triadic relation]]ships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.

Social ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self ''(p)'', another person ''(o), ''and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus ''(x)''. According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).

The overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory ===
Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.

“Ambivalence is a function of the ''amount of conflict'' within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the ''magnitude of the difference'' between evaluations.”&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Attitudes |last= Albarracin |last2=Johnson |last3=Zanna |first= Dolores |first2=Blair |first3=Mark |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Mahwah, New Jersey|page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.

The two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Past studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
The feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in [[social psychology]] ever since. In 1957, [[Leon Festinger]] was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Concepts of Balance, Congruity, and Dissonance |last=Zajonc |first=Robert B. |author-link=Robert Zajonc |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |date=Summer 1960 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=280–296 |doi=10.1086/266949 |jstor=2746406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any ''two ''conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.

Dissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/39/6/735.full.pdf+html|title = Feeling Conflicted and Seeking Information: When Ambivalence Enhances and Diminishes Selective Exposure to  Attitude-Consistent Information |authors=Sawicki, Wegener, Clark, Fabrigar, Smith, Durso |date=2013 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |doi=10.1177/0146167213481388 |pmid=23482502 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=735–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to [[self-esteem]] evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:
# Justify the behavior by changing the dissonant cognition
# Justify the behavior by adding new cognitions
# Change the behavior to meet the dissonant cognition

== Motivation and information processing ==
As noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.

=== Heuristic-systematic model ===
Information processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2008). Attitudinal ambivalence. In W. D. Crano &amp; R. Prislin (Eds.), ''Attitudes and attitude change'' (pp. 261-286). New York, NY: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Antecedents of ambivalence ==

=== Behavioral indicators ===
Researchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).

&lt;u&gt;The Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = (P + N) / 2 - |P-N|&lt;/math&gt;

Here, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, '''interpersonal ambivalence''', the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priester | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Petty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Park | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Whence univalent ambivalence? From the anticipation of conflicting reactions | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 11–21 | doi = 10.1086/513042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Individual differences ===
Individual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the [[need for cognition]], or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Individuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.

Additionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Goal conflicts ===
Ambivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.

Many decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence
every day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Harreveld | first1 = F. | last2 = van der Pligt | first2 = J. | last3 = de Liver | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The agony of ambivalence and ways to resolve it: Introducing the MAID model | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1177/1088868308324518 | pmid=19144904}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the "pleasure" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"/&gt;

=== Value conflicts ===
Ambivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. [[Social constructs]] and perceived norms and [[values]] within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.

Conflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.

The attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.

=== Affective-cognitive ambivalence ===
Affective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “''the heart vs. mind conflict.''”

When each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

That is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hass | first1 = R.

== Consequences of ambivalence as a dimension of attitude strength ==

=== Attitude stability ===
Ambivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Krosnick, J. A., &amp; Petty, R. E. (1995). Attitude strength: An overview. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 1-24). Mahwah, NJ:  Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/26/11/1421.short|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence: A Test of Three Key Hypothesis|last = Armitage |last2=Conner|first =Christopher J. | first2= Mark |date = 2000|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi =10.1177/0146167200263009 |pmid =|volume=26|issue = 11|pages=1421–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddock | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Making a party leader less of a party member: The impact of ambivalence on assimilation and contrast effects in political party attitudes | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 769–780 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-9221.2003.00353.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Attitude pliability ===
Ambivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may [[bias]] or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially "anchored in knowledge structures".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Armitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.

In situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Ambivalence in clinical psychology ==
=== Bleuler's tripartite scheme ===
The concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by [[Eugen Bleuler]], who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article ''Vortrag über Ambivalenz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal | last=Bleuler |first=Eugen |authorlink=Eugen Bleuler |title=Vortrag über Ambivalenz |trans-title=Lecture on Ambivalence |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/gesch/ambiv-g.htm#Aus%20dem%20Zentralblatt%20f%C3%BCr%20Psychoanalyse%201,%201911,%20S. |journal=Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse [Central Journal for Psychoanalysis] |location=[[Bern]] |year=1910 |issue=1 |pages=266-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplanche |first1=Jean |last2=Pontalis |first2=Jean-Bertrand |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Ambivalence (pp. 26–28) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Ambivalence+Ambivalenz |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |page=[https://books.google.it/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Bleuler,+E.+%27Vortrag+iiber+Ambivalenz%27+(1910)%22 28]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards ed, Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 128n.&lt;/ref&gt; Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] called "a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires".&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through [[Buridan's ass]], starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 81-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual ambivalence—the [[Philosophical scepticism|sceptical belief]] that "There is no reason but hath a contrary to it"&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to [[Sextus Empiricus]] and [[Pyrrho]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 715-6 and p. 842.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Freud]] considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them).&lt;ref&gt;E. Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the [[Splitting (psychology)|psychological splitting]] of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how "in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freudian usage ===
Freud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p.  261&lt;/ref&gt;—what Freud called "pairs of contrary component instincts" such as looking and being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leader, ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 61-6&lt;/ref&gt; Others in [[psychoanalysis]] have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 72-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Defences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include [[psychological repression]], [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 157 and p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an [[analysand|analytic patient]]'s love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his "hate" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis.  A [[Substance dependence|drug addict]] may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the "high"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded ''imperative'', rather than as a behavioral ''choice'', complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)

Another relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of "ambivalence" sees it as engendered by all [[neurosis|neurotic]] [[Emotional conflict|conflict]], a person's everyday "mixed feelings" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Ambivalence in philosophy==
Philosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Razinsky |first=Hili |title=Ambivalence.

'''Avidyā''' (Sanskrit; Pāli: ''avijjā''; Tibetan phonetic: ''ma rigpa'') in Buddhist literature is commonly translated as "ignorance".{{Sfn|Keown|2013|p=73}}{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn|Robert Buswell |Donald Lopez|2013|pp=1070}} The concept refers to ignorance or misconceptions about the nature of metaphysical reality, in particular about the [[anicca|impermanence]] and [[anatta|non-self]] doctrines about reality.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus |title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-97342-3 |pages=533–534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Conze|2013|pp=39-40}} It is the root cause of ''[[Dukkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness),{{Sfn|Robert Buswell |Donald Lopez|2013|p=86}} and asserted as the first link, in Buddhist phenomenology, of a process that leads to [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|repeated birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Webster|title=The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S89fgAUG2AEC|date=31 December 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27941-8|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avidyā is mentioned within the Buddhist teachings as ignorance or misunderstanding in various contexts:
* [[Four Noble Truths]]{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=67}}
* The first link in the twelve links of dependent origination
* One of the three poisons within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Six root unwholesome factors|six root kleshas]] within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings
* One of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] in the Theravada tradition 
* Equivalent to [[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings

Within the context of the twelve links of dependent origination, avidya is typically symbolized by a person who is blind or wearing a blindfold.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Etymology==
''Avidyā'' is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of ''a'' and ''vidya'', meaning "not vidya". The word ''vidya'' is derived from the Sanskrit root ''vid'', which means "to know, to perceive, to see, to understand".&lt;ref name=mmwp918&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''avidya'' means to "not know". The ''vid*''-related terms appear extensively in the [[Rigveda]] and other [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=mmwp918/&gt;

In Vedic literature, ''avidya'' refers to "ignorance, spiritual ignorance, illusion"; in early Buddhist texts, states Monier-Williams, it means "ignorance with non-existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''weid''-, meaning "to see" or "to know". It is a cognate with the Latin verb ''vidēre'' ("to see") and English ''wit''.

==Overview==
Avidya is explained in different ways or on different levels within different Buddhist teachings or traditions. On the most fundamental level, it is ignorance or misunderstanding of the nature of reality; {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Avidya can be defined on different levels; for example, it can be defined as a mis-perception of the nature of reality, or as not understanding the four noble truths. For example:
* [[Jeffrey Hopkins]] states: "[Ignorance] isn't just an inability to apprehend the truth but an active misapprehension of the status of oneself and all other objects—one's own mind or body, other people, and so forth. It is the conception or assumption that phenomena exist in a far more concrete way than they actually do. Based on this misapprehension of the status of persons and things, we are drawn into afflictive desire ([[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]) and hatred ([[dvesha]])..."&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1992), p. 4 (from the Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sonam Rinchen states: "Every action leaves its imprint on the mind, and later craving and grasping activate the imprint to bring about its result. Underlying this kind of action is our ignorance, namely our innate misconception of the self, the root of all our troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}} more specifically about the nature of not-Self and dependent origination doctrines.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn|Conze|2013|pp=39-40}}{{Sfn|Williams|Tribe|2000|pp=66-67, Quote: From this perspective Not-Self and dependent origination together come to form the two pillars of the final gnosis (vidya) which is the antidote to ignorance (avidya).}} ''Avidya'' is not lack of information, states Peter Harvey, but a "more deep seated misperception of reality".{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=67}} Gethin calls Avidya as 'positive misconception', not mere absence of knowledge.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|p=150}} It is a key concept in Buddhism, wherein ''Avidya'' about the nature of reality, rather than sin, is considered the basic root of ''[[Dukkha]]''.{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=65-68}} Removal of this ''Avidya'' leads to overcoming of ''Dukkha''.{{Sfn|Edelglass|2009|p=171}}

While Avidyā found in Buddhism and other Indian philosophies is often translated as "ignorance", states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because it means more than ignorance. He suggests the term "unwisdom" to be a better rendition.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Meaning of Unwisdom (Avidya)| author= Alex Wayman|journal = Philosophy East and West| volume= 7| number= 1/2| year= 1957| pages= 21–25 | jstor= 1396830| doi=10.2307/1396830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions).&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt; Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;

In other contexts, avidya includes not knowing or not understanding the nature of phenomena as impermanent, the [[Four Noble Truths]],{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=67}} other Buddhist doctrines, or the path to end suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst (2009), Buddhist Teaching in India, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-861715667}}, pages 40-43&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Peter Harvey|2013|pp=5, 40, 134-137}} Sonam Rinchen states ''Avidya'' in the context of the twelve links, that "[Ignorance] is the opposite of the understanding that the person or other phenomena lack intrinsic existence. Those who are affected by this ignorance create actions which precipitate them into further worldly existence."&lt;ref&gt;Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Not understanding the [[Four Noble Truths]], or its implications, is also Avidya.&lt;ref name=s1&gt;Ajahn Sucitto (2010), Kindle Locations 1125-1132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avidya in Buddhist traditions==
Avidya appears as a major item of discussion in two doctrines about the nature of reality, in various Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winston L. King|title=Buddhism and Christianity: Some Bridges of Understanding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaZTAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-56555-9|pages=186–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|author2=Frank E.

The doctrines of no-self and impermanence are thus the keystones of ''dhammic'' order."&lt;/ref&gt; One relates to the [[Anatta]] (Anatman) doctrine, that is ignorance or misconceptions about "Self", when in reality there is only non-Self according to Buddhism.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=146-159, 243}}{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=72, 125-126, 144}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Charles Harris |title=The Continuity of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLZeKatsbaYC |year=1991|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-09448-2 |pages=138–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second relates to [[Anicca]] doctrine, that is ignorance or misconceptions about "permanence", when the nature of reality is impermanence.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=73-75}}{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=68}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Charles Harris |title=The Continuity of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLZeKatsbaYC |year=1991|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-09448-2 |pages=174–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada===
{{Nidanas|float=right}}
Bhikkhu Bodhi states that Avidya is an important part of the Theravada Abhidharma teachings about [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent arising]] about conditions that sustain the wheel of birth and death. One such condition is the karmic formations that arise from ignorance. In other words, states Bodhi, ignorance (avijja) obscures "perception of the true nature of things just as a cataract obscures perception of visible objects". In the Suttanta literature, this ignorance refers to the non-knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. In the Abhidharma literature, in addition to the Four Noble Truths, it is the non-knowledge of one's 'past pre-natal lives' and 'post-mortem future lives' and of dependent arising.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ACrogsyJmoAC A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma: The Abhidhammattha Sangaha], Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana===
{{see also|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika_distinction#Ignorance_-_The_Object_to_be_Negated}}
The Mahayana tradition considers ignorance about the nature of reality and immemorial past lives to be a primordial force, which can only be broken through the insight of Emptiness (''[[sunyata]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruno Petzold |title=The Classification of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZH29oiIuIkC |year=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-03373-2 |pages=259–260, 849 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to other Buddhist traditions, states Jens Braarvig, Avidyā is not so much emphasized, instead the emphasis on "construing an illusory reality" based on conceptualization when the ultimate reality is Emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guttorm Fløistad|title=Philosophie asiatique/Asian philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDHyCAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-011-2510-9|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avidya is the greatest impurity and the primary cause of suffering, rebirth. The insight into Emptiness, state Garfield and Edelglass, that is the "lack of inherent nature of all phenomena, including the self, cuts the impurities", an insight into Emptiness yields full awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield|author2=William Edelglass|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vajrayana===
{{main article|Twelve Nidānas}}
The Vajrayana tradition considers ignorance as fetters of bondage into samsara, and its teachings have focussed on a Tantric path under the guidance of a teacher, to remove ''Avidya'' and achieve liberation in a single lifetime.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=162}}

Avidyā is identified as the first of the twelve links of dependent origination (twelve nidanas)—a sequence of links that describe why a being reincarnates and remains bound within the [[samsara]], a cycle of repeated births and deaths in six realms of existence.&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2015p50"/&gt; The twelve nidanas are an application of the Buddhist concept of [[pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination). This theory, presented in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] II.2–4 and [[Digha Nikaya]] II.55–63, asserts that rebirth, re-aging and re-death ultimately arise through a series of twelve links or ''nidanas'' ultimately rooted in Avidyā, and the twelfth step ''Jarāmaraṇa'' triggers the dependent origination of ''Avidyā'', recreating an unending cycle of [[dukkha]] (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2015p50"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M. Emmanuel|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_lmCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-14466-3|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F Harold Smith|title=The Buddhist Way of Life: Its Philosophy and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA1FoKPGIRgC&amp;pg=PT37|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-02929-6|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Removing avidya ==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
Avidya or ignorance can be eliminated directly by cultivating its opposite viz. Knowledge, wisdom and perception, where the above refer to the true knowledge and perception of reality. 
The various ways to remove Avidya is by learning from Guru/teacher who knows or from books and scriptures. Also Avidya can be removed through Meditation or more precisely practice of Dhyana and Yoga. Through practice of Dharma and righteousness Avidya gets removed. 
Unrighteous karma increases Ignorance while Ignorance perpetuates Adharma.

[[File:Chemotaxis1.jpg|thumb|Capillary tube assay for chemotaxis. Motile prokaryotes sense chemicals in their environment and change their motility accordingly. Absent chemicals, movement is completely random. When an attractant or repellent is present, runs become longer and tumbles become less frequent. The result is net movement towards or away from the chemical (i.e., up or down the chemical gradient). The net movement can be seen in the beaker, where the bacteria accumulate around the origin of the attractant, and away from the origin of the repellent.]]
'''Chemotaxis''' (from ''[[chemical substance|chemo-]]'' + ''[[taxis]]'') is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chemotaxis|volume=6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somatic cell]]s, [[bacteria]], and other [[single-cell organism|single-cell]] or [[multicellular]] organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g., [[glucose]]) by swimming toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from [[poison]]s (e.g., [[phenol]]). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g., movement of [[sperm]] towards the egg during [[fertilization]]) and subsequent phases of development (e.g., migration of [[neuron]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s) as well as in normal function and health (e.g., migration of [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] during injury or infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Oliveira S, Rosowski EE, Huttenlocher A | title = Neutrophil migration in infection and wound repair: going forward in reverse | journal = Nature Reviews.

''Positive'' chemotaxis occurs if the movement is toward a higher concentration of the chemical in question; ''negative'' chemotaxis if the movement is in the opposite direction. Chemically prompted [[kinesis (biology)|kinesis]] (randomly directed or nondirectional) can be called [[chemokinesis]].

== History of chemotaxis research ==

Although migration of cells was detected from the early days of the development of microscopy by [[Leeuwenhoek]], a Caltech lecture regarding chemotaxis propounds that 'erudite description of chemotaxis was only first made by [[Theodor Wilhelm Engelmann|T. W. Engelmann]] (1881) and [[Wilhelm Pfeffer|W. F. Pfeffer]] (1884) in bacteria, and [[Herbert Spencer Jennings|H. S. Jennings]] (1906) in [[ciliate]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Chemotaxis Lecture. Uploaded in 2007. available at: http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/aph161/2007/lectures/ChemotaxisLecture.pdf (Last inspected: 15/04/17)&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Prize laureate [[Élie Metchnikoff|I.

Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of chemotaxis in biology and clinical pathology was widely accepted in the 1930s, and the most fundamental definitions underlying the phenomenon were drafted by this time.{{By whom|date=April 2017}} The most important aspects in quality control of [[chemotaxis assay]]s were described by [[Henry Harris (scientist)|H.

Some [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', have several [[flagellum|flagella]] per cell (4–10 typically). These can rotate in two ways:
# Counter-clockwise rotation aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in a straight line; and
# Clockwise rotation breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yuan |first1=Junhua |last2=Fahrner |first2=Karen A. |last3=Turner |first3=Linda |last4=Berg |first4=Howard C. |title=Asymmetry in the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the bacterial flagellar motor |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2919929/ |website=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |accessdate=19 October 2018 |pages=12846–12849 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1007333107 |date=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The directions of rotation are given for an observer outside the cell looking down the flagella toward the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_16_17/Biophysics_of_Systems/013_BakterChemotaxis_DB_WS16.pdf|title=Bacterial Chemotaxis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior ===
The overall movement of a bacterium is the result of alternating tumble and swim phases.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If one watches a bacterium swimming in a uniform environment, its movement will look like a [[random walk]] with relatively straight swims interrupted by random tumbles that reorient the bacterium.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' are unable to choose the direction in which they swim, and are unable to swim in a straight line for more than a few seconds due to rotational [[diffusion]]; in other words, bacteria "forget" the direction in which they are going.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} By repeatedly evaluating their course, and adjusting if they are moving in the wrong direction, bacteria can direct their motion to find favorable locations with high concentrations of attractants (usually food) and avoid repellents (usually poisons).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the presence of a chemical [[gradient]] bacteria will chemotax, or direct their overall motion based on the gradient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If the bacterium senses that it is moving in the correct direction (toward attractant/away from repellent), it will keep swimming in a straight line for a longer time before tumbling; however, if it is moving in the wrong direction, it will tumble sooner and try a new direction at random.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In other words, bacteria like ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' use temporal sensing to decide whether their situation is improving or not, and in this way, find the location with the highest concentration of attractant (usually the source) quite well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Even under very high concentrations, it can still distinguish very small differences in concentration, and fleeing from a repellent works with the same efficiency.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

This biased random walk is a result of simply choosing between two methods of random movement; namely tumbling and straight swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macnab RM, Koshland DE | title = The gradient-sensing mechanism in bacterial chemotaxis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 69 | issue = 9 | pages = 2509–12 | date = September 1972 | pmid = 4560688 | pmc = 426976 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.9.2509 | bibcode = 1972PNAS...69.2509M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, chemotactic responses such as ''forgetting'' direction and ''choosing'' movements resemble the decision-making abilities of higher life-forms with brains that process sensory data.{{according to whom|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The helical nature of the individual flagellar filament is critical for this movement to occur, and the protein that makes up the flagellar filament, [[flagellin]], is quite similar among all flagellated bacteria.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Vertebrates seem to have taken advantage of this fact by possessing an immune receptor ([[Toll-like receptor|TLR5]]) designed to recognize this conserved protein.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

As in many instances in biology, there are bacteria that do not follow this rule. Many bacteria, such as ''Vibrio'', are monoflagellated and have a single flagellum at one pole of the cell. Their method of chemotaxis is different. Others possess a single flagellum that is kept inside the cell wall. These bacteria move by spinning the whole cell, which is shaped like a corkscrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard C. |last=Berg | name-list-format = vanc | title=''E. coli'' in motion | year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-387-00888-2 |publisher=Springer | location=New York, NY }}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

===Signal transduction===
[[Image:ChtxAspRec.png|right|350 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Domain structure of chemotaxis receptor for Asp&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemical gradients are sensed through multiple [[transmembrane receptor]]s, called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which vary in the molecules that they detect.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} These receptors may bind attractants or repellents directly or indirectly through interaction with proteins of [[periplasmatic space]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The signals from these receptors are transmitted across the [[plasma membrane]] into the [[cytosol]], where ''[[Che proteins]]'' are activated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Che proteins alter the tumbling frequency, and alter the receptors.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Flagellum regulation====
The proteins CheW and CheA bind to the receptor. The absence of receptor activation results in [[phosphorylation|autophosphorylation]] in the histidine kinase, CheA, at a single highly conserved histidine residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4lv7cBYVug|title=Chemotaxis|first=|last=ToxCafe|date=2 June 2011|publisher=|accessdate=March 23, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} CheA, in turn, transfers phosphoryl groups to conserved aspartate residues in the response regulators CheB and CheY; CheA is a histidine kinase and it does not actively transfer the phosphoryl group, rather, the response regulator [[Protein-glutamate methylesterase|CheB]] takes the phosphoryl group from CheA.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This mechanism of signal transduction is called a [[two-component regulatory system|two-component system]], and it is a common form of signal transduction in bacteria.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} CheY induces tumbling by interacting with the flagellar switch protein FliM, inducing a change from counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation of the flagellum. Change in the rotation state of a single flagellum can disrupt the entire flagella bundle and cause a tumble.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Receptor regulation====
[[Image:Chtxbactsign1.png|right|450 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Signalling pathways of E.coli&lt;/div&gt;]]
CheB, when activated by CheA, acts as a [[demethylase|methylesterase]], removing methyl groups from [[glutamate]] residues on the [[cytosol]]ic side of the receptor; it works antagonistically with CheR, a methyl[[transferase]], which adds methyl residues to the same glutamate residues.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If the level of an attractant remains high, the level of phosphorylation of CheA (and, therefore, CheY and CheB) will remain low, the cell will swim smoothly, and the level of methylation of the MCPs will increase (because CheB-P is not present to demethylate).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The MCPs no longer respond to the attractant when they are fully methylated; therefore, even though the level of attractant might remain high, the level of CheA-P (and CheB-P) increases and the cell begins to tumble.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The MCPs can be demethylated by CheB-P, and, when this happens, the receptors can once again respond to attractants.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The situation is the opposite with regard to repellents: fully methylated MCPs respond best to repellents, while least-methylated MCPs respond worst to repellents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This regulation allows the bacterium to 'remember' chemical concentrations from the recent past, a few seconds, and compare them to those it is currently experiencing, thus 'know' whether it is traveling up or down a gradient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Although the methylation system accounts for the wide range of sensitivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mello BA, Tu Y | title = Effects of adaptation in maintaining high sensitivity over a wide range of backgrounds for Escherichia coli chemotaxis | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 2329–37 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17208965 | pmc = 1864821 | doi = 10.1529/biophysj.106.097808 | bibcode = 2007BpJ....92.2329M }}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} that bacteria have to chemical gradients, other mechanisms are involved in increasing the absolute value of the sensitivity on a given background.

== Chemoattractants and chemorepellents ==
Chemoattractants and chemorepellents are [[inorganic]] or [[Organic compound|organic]] substances possessing chemotaxis-inducer effect in motile cells. These chemotactic [[ligand]]s create chemical concentration gradients that organisms, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, move toward or away from, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Xu | first = Feifei | last2 = Bierman | first2 = Robert | last3 = Healy | first3 = Frank | last4 = Nguyen | first4 = Hoa | name-list-format = vanc |title=A multi-scale model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis from intracellular signaling pathway to motility and nutrient uptake in nutrient gradient and isotropic fluid environments|doi = 10.1016/j.camwa.2015.12.019 |journal=Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications|volume=71| issue = 11 |pages=2466–2478 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tap and Tsr recognize [[dipeptide]]s and [[serine]] as chemoattractants, respectively.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

Chemoattractants or chemorepellents bind MCPs at its extracellular domain; an intracellular signaling domain relays the changes in concentration of these chemotactic ligands to downstream proteins like that of CheA which then relays this signal to flagellar motors via phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P).&lt;ref name="twenty" /&gt; CheY-P can then control flagellar rotation influencing the direction of cell motility.&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt;

For ''E.coli'', ''[[S. meliloti]]'', and ''[[R. spheroids]],'' the binding of chemoattractants to MCPs inhibit CheA and therefore CheY-P activity, resulting in smooth runs, but for ''[[Bacillus subtilis|B. substilis]]'', CheA activity increases.&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt; Methylation events in ''E.coli'' cause MCPs to have lower affinity to chemoattractants which causes increased activity of CheA and CheY-P resulting in tumbles.&lt;ref name="twenty" /&gt; In this way cells are able to adapt to the immediate chemoattractant concentration and detect further changes to modulate cell motility.&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt;

Chemoattractants in eukaryotes are well characterized for immune cells. [[Formyl]] [[peptide]]s, such as [[N-formylmethioninyl]], attract [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] such as [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s, causing movement toward infection sites.&lt;ref name="shiffmann"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffmann E, Corcoran BA, Wahl SM | title = N-formylmethionyl peptides as chemoattractants for leucocytes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 1059–62 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1093163 | pmc = 432465 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.72.3.1059| url = http://www.pnas.org/content/72/3/1059.full.pdf | bibcode = 1975PNAS...72.1059S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-acylated methioninyl peptides do not act as chemoattractants to neutrophils and macrophages.&lt;ref name="shiffmann" /&gt; Leukocytes also move toward chemoattractants C5a, a [[Complement system|complement]] component, and [[pathogen]]-specific ligands on bacteria.&lt;ref name="shiffmann" /&gt;

Mechanisms concerning chemorepellents are less known than chemoattractants. Although chemorepellents work to confer an avoidance response in organisms, [[Tetrahymena|''Tetrahymena thermophila'']]  adapt to a chemorepellent, [[Netrin-1 peptide]], within 10 minutes of exposure; however, exposure to chemorepellents such as [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], [[PACAP-38]], and [[nociceptin]] show no such adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuruvilla H, Schmidt B, Song S, Bhajjan M, Merical M, Alley C, Griffin C, Yoder D, Hein J, Kohl D, Puffenberger C, Petroff D, Newcomer E, Good K, Heston G, Hurtubise A | title = Netrin-1 Peptide Is a Chemorepellent in Tetrahymena thermophila | journal = International Journal of Peptides | volume = 2016 | pages = 1–7 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27123011 | doi = 10.1155/2016/7142868 | pmc=4830718}}&lt;/ref&gt; GTP and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] are chemorepellents in micro-molar concentrations to both ''Tetrahymena'' and ''[[Paramecium]]''.

The mechanism of chemotaxis that [[eukaryotic]] cells employ is quite different from that in bacteria; however, sensing of chemical gradients is still a crucial step in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Köhidai|first1=Laszio | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Chemotaxis as an Expression of Communication of Tetrahymena|title=Biocommunication of Ciliates|editor-first=G |editor-last=Witzany |editor2-first=M |editor2-last=Nowacki |date=2016|pages=65&amp;ndash;82|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32211-7_5|isbn=978-3-319-32211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} Due to their small size, prokaryotes cannot directly detect a concentration gradient.

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotes and have receptors embedded uniformly throughout the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name="Levine2013" /&gt; Eukaryotic chemotaxis involves detecting a concentration gradient spatially by comparing the asymmetric activation of these receptors at the different ends of the cell.&lt;ref name="Levine2013" /&gt; Activation of these receptors results in migration towards chemoattractants, or away from chemorepellants.&lt;ref name="Levine2013" /&gt;

Levels of receptors, intracellular signalling pathways and the effector mechanisms all represent diverse, eukaryotic-type components. In eukaryotic unicellular cells, amoeboid movement and cilium or the eukaryotic flagellum are the main effectors (e.g., [[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]] or [[Tetrahymena]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bagorda A, Parent CA | title = Eukaryotic chemotaxis at a glance | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 121 | issue = Pt 16 | pages = 2621–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18685153 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.018077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Köhidai L | title = Chemotaxis: the proper physiological response to evaluate phylogeny of signal molecules | journal = Acta Biologica Hungarica | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–94 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10735174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some eukaryotic cells of [[higher vertebrate]] origin, such as [[immune system|immune cells]] also move to where they need to be. Besides immune competent cells ([[granulocyte]], [[monocyte]], [[lymphocyte]]) a large group of cells—considered previously to be fixed into tissues—are also motile in special physiological (e.g., [[mast cell]], [[fibroblast]], [[endothelial cells]]) or pathological conditions (e.g., [[metastases]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kedrin D, van Rheenen J, Hernandez L, Condeelis J, Segall JE | title = Cell motility and cytoskeletal regulation in invasion and metastasis | journal = Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia | volume = 12 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–52 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17557195 | doi = 10.1007/s10911-007-9046-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotaxis has high significance in the early phases of [[embryogenesis]] as development of [[germ layers]] is guided by gradients of signal molecules.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Motility===
Unlike motility in bacterial chemotaxis, the mechanism by which eukaryotic cells physically move is unclear. There appear to be mechanisms by which an external chemotactic gradient is sensed and turned into an intracellular [[PIP3]] gradient, which results in a gradient and the activation of a signaling pathway, culminating in the [[polymerisation]] of [[actin]] filaments. The growing distal end of actin filaments develops connections with the internal surface of the plasma membrane via different sets of peptides and results in the formation of anterior[[pseudopods]] and posterior [[Uropod (immunology)|uropods]].
[[Cilium|Cilia]] of eukaryotic cells can also produce chemotaxis; in this case, it is mainly a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent induction of the [[microtubule|microtubular]] system of the [[basal body]] and the beat of the 9+2 microtubules within cilia. The orchestrated beating of hundreds of cilia is synchronized by a submembranous system built between basal bodies.
The details of the signaling pathways are still not totally clear.

====Chemotaxis-related migratory responses====
[[Image:Chtxphenomen1.png|right|400 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Chemotaxis related migratory responses&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemotaxis refers to the directional migration of cells in response to chemical gradients; several variations of chemical-induced migration exist as listed below. 
* ''[[Chemokinesis]]'' refers to an increase in cellular motility in response to chemicals in the surrounding environment. Unlike chemotaxis, the migration stimulated by chemokinesis lacks directionality, and instead increases environmental scanning behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker EL | title = Stimulated neutrophil locomotion: chemokinesis and chemotaxis | journal = Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | volume = 101 | issue = 10 | pages = 509–13 | date = October 1977 | pmid = 199132  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In ''[[haptotaxis]]'' the [[gradient]] of the chemoattractant is expressed or bound on a surface, in contrast to the classical model of chemotaxis, in which the gradient develops in a soluble fluid.&lt;ref name="pmid6030602"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter SB | title = Haptotaxis and the mechanism of cell motility | journal = Nature | volume = 213 | issue = 5073 | pages = 256–60 | year = 1967 | pmid = 6030602 | doi = 10.1038/213256a0 | bibcode = 1967Natur.213..256C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common biologically active haptotactic surface is the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM); the presence of bound [[ligands]] is responsible for induction of transendothelial migration and [[angiogenesis]].
* ''[[Necrotaxis]]'' embodies a special type of chemotaxis when the chemoattractant molecules are released from [[necrosis|necrotic]] or [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] cells. Depending on the chemical character of released substances, necrotaxis can accumulate or repel cells, which underlines the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon.

===Receptors===
In general, eukaryotic cells sense the presence of chemotactic stimuli through the use of 7-transmembrane (or serpentine) heterotrimeric [[G protein|G-protein]]-coupled receptors, a class representing a significant portion of the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim JY, Haastert PV, Devreotes PN | title = Social senses: G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways in Dictyostelium discoideum | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–43 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8807851 | doi=10.1016/s1074-5521(96)90103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of this gene superfamily are used in eyesight (rhodopsins) as well as in olfaction (smelling).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montell C | title = Visual transduction in Drosophila | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | pages = 231–68 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10611962 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.231  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Antunes G, Simoes de Souza FM | title = Olfactory receptor signaling | journal = Methods in Cell Biology | volume = 132 | pages = 127–45 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26928542 | doi = 10.1016/bs.mcb.2015.11.003  | isbn = 9780128035955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main classes of chemotaxis receptors are triggered by:

*Metabolites of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s
** ''[[Leukotrienes]]'' are [[eicosanoid]] lipid mediators made by the metabolism of [[arachidonic acid]] by [[ALOX5]] (also termed 5-lipoxygenase). Their most prominent member with chemotactic factor activity is [[leukotriene B4]], which elicits adhesion, chemotaxis, and aggregation of leukocytes. The chemoattractant action of LTB4 is induced via either of two [[G protein–coupled receptor]]s, [[BLT]]1 and [[BLT2]], which are highly expressed in cells involved in [[inflammation]] and [[allergy]].&lt;ref name="pmid25449650"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biosynthesis, biological effects, and receptors of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and oxoeicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs) derived from arachidonic acid | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 340–55 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25449650 | pmc = 5710736 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The family of [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid]] eicosanoids are arachidonic acid metabolites also formed by ALOX5.

==== Chemotactic range fitting ====
[[Image:chtxCRF2.png|right|250 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;[[Chemotactic range fitting]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemotactic responses elicited by the ligand-receptor interactions are, in general, distinguished upon the optimal effective concentration(s) of the ligand. Nevertheless, correlation of the amplitude elicited and ratio of the responder cells compared to the total number are also characteristic features of the chemotactic signaling. Investigations of ligand families (e.g., amino acids or oligo peptides) proved that there is a fitting of ranges (amplitudes; number of responder cells) and chemotactic activities: Chemoattractant moiety is accompanied by wide ranges, whereas chemorepellent character by narrow ranges.

==Clinical significance==
A changed migratory potential of cells has relatively high importance in the development of several clinical symptoms and syndromes.
Altered chemotactic activity of extracellular (e.g., [[Escherichia coli]]) or intracellular (e.g., [[Listeria monocytogenes]]) pathogens itself represents a significant clinical target. Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.
Apart from infections, there are some other diseases wherein impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.

==Mathematical models==
Several mathematical models of chemotaxis were developed depending on the type of
* migration (e.g., basic differences of bacterial swimming, movement of unicellular eukaryotes with [[cilia]]/[[flagellum]] and [[ameboid|amoeboid]] migration)
* physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals (e.g., [[diffusion]]) working as ligands
* biological characteristics of the ligands (attractant, neutral, and repellent molecules)
* assay systems applied to evaluate chemotaxis (see incubation times, development, and stability of concentration gradients)
* other environmental effects possessing direct or indirect influence on the migration (lighting, temperature, magnetic fields, etc.)

Although interactions of the factors listed above make the behavior of the solutions of mathematical models of chemotaxis rather complex, it is possible to describe the basic phenomenon of chemotaxis-driven motion in a straightforward way.
Indeed, let us denote with &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the spatially non-uniform concentration of the chemo-attractant and with &lt;math&gt;\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; its gradient. Then the chemotactic cellular flow (also called current) &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; that is generated by the chemotaxis is linked to the above gradient by the law: &lt;math&gt; J = \chi C \nabla\varphi &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the spatial density of the cells and &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ’Chemotactic coefficient’. However, note that in many cases &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is not constant: It is, instead, a decreasing function of the concentration of the chemo-attractant &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \chi(\varphi) &lt;/math&gt;.

[[Spatial ecology]] of soil microorganisms is a function of their chemotactic sensitivities towards substrate and fellow organisms.&lt;ref name="Gharasoo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.11.019|title=How the chemotactic characteristics of bacteria can determine their population patterns|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=69 |pages=346–358 |year=2014 |last1=Gharasoo |first1=Mehdi |last2=Centler |first2=Florian|last3=Fetzer|first3=Ingo|last4=Thullner|first4=Martin | name-list-format = vanc }}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} The chemotactic behavior of the bacteria was proven to lead to non-trivial population patterns even in the absence of environmental heterogeneities. The presence of structural pore scale heterogeneities has an extra impact on the emerging bacterial patterns.

==Measurement of chemotaxis==
{{main|Chemotaxis assay}}
A wide range of techniques is available to evaluate chemotactic activity of cells or the chemoattractant and chemorepellent character of ligands.
The basic requirements of the measurement are as follows:
* concentration gradients can develop relatively quickly and persist for a long time in the system
* chemotactic and chemokinetic activities are distinguished
* migration of cells is free toward and away on the axis of the concentration gradient
* detected responses are the results of active migration of cells

Despite the fact that an ideal [[chemotaxis assay]] is still not available, there are several protocols and pieces of equipment that offer good correspondence with the conditions described above. The most commonly used are summarised in the table below:

Applications include targeted delivery of drugs in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lagzi|first=István|title=Chemical Robotics—Chemotactic Drug Carriers|journal=Central European Journal of Medicine|year=2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=377–382|doi=10.2478/s11536-012-0130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, enzyme molecules have also shown positive chemotactic behavior in a gradient of their substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Samudra|last2=Dey|first2=Krishna K.|last3=Muddana|first3=Hari S.|last4=Tabouillot|first4=Tristan|last5=Ibele|first5=Michael E.|last6=Butler|first6=Peter J.|last7=Sen|first7=Ayusman|date=2013-01-22|title=Enzyme Molecules as Nanomotors|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=135|issue=4|pages=1406–1414|doi=10.1021/ja3091615|pmid=23308365|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, enzymes in cascades have also shown substrate-driven chemotactic aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Xi|last2=Palacci|first2=Henri|last3=Yadav|first3=Vinita|last4=Spiering|first4=Michelle M.|last5=Gilson|first5=Michael K.|last6=Butler|first6=Peter J.|last7=Hess|first7=Henry|last8=Benkovic|first8=Stephen J.|last9=Sen|first9=Ayusman|date=2017-12-18|title=Substrate-driven chemotactic assembly in an enzyme cascade|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2905|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=10|issue=3|pages=311–317|doi=10.1038/nchem.2905|pmid=29461522|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irrotationalfield.svg|thumb|Vector field corresponding to a differential form on the [[punctured plane]] that is closed but not exact, showing that the de Rham cohomology of this space is non-trivial.]]
In [[mathematics]], '''de Rham cohomology''' (after [[Georges de Rham]]) is a tool belonging both to [[algebraic topology]] and to [[differential topology]], capable of expressing basic topological information about [[smooth manifold]]s in a form particularly adapted to computation and the concrete representation of [[cohomology class]]es. It is a [[cohomology theory]] based on the existence of [[differential form]]s with prescribed properties.

{{Quote frame|text=The integration on forms concept is of fundamental importance in differential topology, geometry, and physics, and also yields one of the most important examples of ''cohomology'', namely ''de Rham cohomology'', which (roughly speaking) measures precisely the extent to which the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] fails in higher dimensions and on general manifolds.

==Definition==
The '''de Rham complex''' is the [[cochain complex]] of [[differential form]]s on some [[smooth manifold]] {{mvar|M}}, with the [[exterior derivative]] as the differential:

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \Omega^0(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^1(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^2(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^3(M) \to \cdots ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of [[Smoothness|smooth functions]] on {{mvar|M}}, {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of {{math|1}}-forms, and so forth. Forms that are the image of other forms under the [[exterior derivative]], plus the constant {{math|0}} function in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}, are called '''exact''' and forms whose exterior derivative is {{math|0}} are called '''closed''' (see ''[[Closed and exact differential forms]]''); the relationship {{math|''d''{{i sup|2}} {{=}} 0}} then says that exact forms are closed. 

In contrast, closed forms are not necessarily exact. An illustrative case is a circle as a manifold, and the {{math|1}}-form corresponding to the derivative of angle from a reference point at its centre, typically written as {{math|''dθ''}} (described at ''[[Closed and exact differential forms]]''). There is no function {{math|''θ''}} defined on the whole circle such that {{math|''dθ''}} is its derivative; the increase of {{math|2''π''}} in going once around the circle in the positive direction implies a [[multivalued function]] {{math|''θ''}}. Removing one point of the circle obviates this, at the same time changing the topology of the manifold.

The idea behind de Rham cohomology is to define [[equivalence class]]es of closed forms on a manifold. One classifies two closed forms {{math|''α'', ''β'' ∈ Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} as '''cohomologous''' if they differ by an exact form, that is, if {{math|''α'' − ''β''}} is exact. This classification induces an equivalence relation on the space of closed forms in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}. One then defines the {{mvar|k}}-th '''de Rham cohomology group''' &lt;math&gt;H^{k}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of equivalence classes, that is, the set of closed forms in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} modulo the exact forms.

Note that, for any manifold {{mvar|M}} composed of {{math|''m''}} disconnected components, each of which is [[Connected space|connected]], we have that

:&lt;math&gt;H^{0}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M) \cong \R ^m .&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from the fact that any smooth function on {{mvar|M}} with zero derivative everywhere is separately constant on each of the connected components of {{mvar|M}}.

==De Rham cohomology computed==
One may often find the general de Rham cohomologies of a manifold using the above fact about the zero cohomology and a [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]]. Another useful fact is that the de Rham cohomology is a [[homotopy]] invariant. While the computation is not given, the following are the computed de Rham cohomologies for some common [[topological]] objects:

===The {{math|''n''}}-sphere===
For the [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]], ''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', and also when taken together with a product of open intervals, we have the following. Let {{math|''n'' &gt; 0, ''m'' ≥ 0}}, and {{mvar|I}} be an open real interval. Then

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(S^n \times I^m) \simeq \begin{cases} \R &amp;  k = 0,n, \\ 0 &amp;  k \ne 0,n. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===The {{math|''n''}}-torus===
Similarly, allowing {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}} here, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(T^n) \simeq \R ^{n \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can also find explicit generators for the de Rham cohomology of the torus directly using differential forms. Given a quotient manifold &lt;math&gt;\pi: X \to X/G&lt;/math&gt; and a differential form &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega^k(X)&lt;/math&gt; we can say that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;'''-invariant''' if given any diffeomorphism induced by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cdot g:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; we can &lt;math&gt;(\cdot g)^*(\omega) = \omega&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the pullback of any form on &lt;math&gt;X/G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant. Also, the pullback is an injective morphism. In our case of &lt;math&gt;\R^n/\Z^n&lt;/math&gt; the differential forms &lt;math&gt;dx_i&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\Z^n&lt;/math&gt;-invariant since &lt;math&gt;d (x_i + k) = dx_i&lt;/math&gt;. But, notice that &lt;math&gt;x_i + \alpha&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \R&lt;/math&gt; is not an invariant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-form. This with injectivity implies that

:&lt;math&gt;[dx_i] \in H^1_{dR}(T^n)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the cohomology ring of a torus is generated by &lt;math&gt;H^1&lt;/math&gt;, taking the exterior products of these forms gives all of the explicit representatives for the de Rham cohomology of a torus.

===Punctured Euclidean space===
Punctured Euclidean space is simply [[Euclidean space]] with the origin removed.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\forall n \in \N, H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(\R ^n \setminus \{\vec{0}\}) &amp;\simeq \begin{cases} \R &amp; k = 0,n-1 \\ 0 &amp; k \ne 0,n-1 \end{cases} \\
&amp;\simeq H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(S^{n-1})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===The Möbius strip===
We may deduce from the fact that the [[Möbius strip]], {{mvar|M}}, can be [[deformation retract]]ed to the {{math|1}}-sphere (i.e. the real unit circle), that:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(M) \simeq H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(S^1).&lt;/math&gt;

==De Rham's theorem==
[[Stokes' theorem]] is an expression of [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] between de Rham cohomology and the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of [[Chain (algebraic topology)|chains]]. It says that the pairing of differential forms and chains, via integration, gives a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] from de Rham cohomology &lt;math&gt;H^{k}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)&lt;/math&gt; to [[singular cohomology|singular cohomology group]]s &lt;math&gt;H^k(M;\R).&lt;/math&gt; '''De Rham's theorem''', proved by [[Georges de Rham]] in 1931, states that for a smooth manifold {{mvar|M}}, this map is in fact an isomorphism. 

More precisely, consider the map 

:&lt;math&gt;I: H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M) \to H^p(M; \R),&lt;/math&gt; 

defined as follows: for any &lt;math&gt;[\omega] \in H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M)&lt;/math&gt;, let {{math|''I''(''ω'')}} be the element of &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(H_p(M; \R ), \R ) \simeq H^p(M; \R )&lt;/math&gt; that acts as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;H_p(M) \ni [c] \longmapsto \int_c \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem of de Rham asserts that this is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology.

The [[exterior product]] endows the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of these groups with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. A further result of the theorem is that the two [[cohomology ring]]s are isomorphic (as [[graded ring]]s), where the analogous product on singular cohomology is the [[cup product]].

==Sheaf-theoretic de Rham isomorphism==
The de Rham cohomology is [[isomorphic]] to the [[Čech cohomology]] {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;('''U''', ''F'')}}, where {{mvar|F}} is the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[abelian group]]s determined by &lt;math&gt;F(U) = \R&lt;/math&gt; for all connected open sets {{math|''U'' ⊂ ''M''}}, and for open sets {{math|''U'', ''V''}} such that {{math|''U'' ⊂ ''V''}}, the group morphism {{math|res&lt;sub&gt;''V'',''U''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''F''(''V'') → ''F''(''U'')}} is given by the identity map on &lt;math&gt;\R,&lt;/math&gt; and where {{math|'''U'''}} is a good [[open cover]] of {{mvar|M}} (i.e. all the open sets in the open cover {{math|'''U'''}} are [[Contractible space|contractible]] to a point, and all finite intersections of sets in {{math|'''U'''}} are either empty or contractible to a point).

Stated another way, if {{mvar|M}} is a compact [[differentiability class|{{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] manifold of dimension {{mvar|m}}, then for each {{math|''k'' ≤ ''m''}}, there is an isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;H^k_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)\cong \check{H}^k(M,\R )&lt;/math&gt;

where the left-hand side is the {{mvar|k}}-th de Rham cohomology group and the right-hand side is the Čech cohomology for the [[constant sheaf]] with fibre &lt;math&gt;\R.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
Let {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf of germs]] of {{mvar|k}}-forms on {{mvar|M}} (with {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} the sheaf of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions on {{mvar|M}}). By the [[Poincaré lemma]], the following sequence of sheaves is exact (in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of sheaves):

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \R \to \Omega^0 \,\xrightarrow{d}\, \Omega^1 \,\xrightarrow{d}\, \Omega^2\,\xrightarrow{d} \dots \xrightarrow{d}\, \Omega^m \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This sequence now breaks up into [[short exact sequence]]s

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to d\Omega^{k-1} \,\xrightarrow{\subset}\, \Omega^k \,\xrightarrow{d}\, d\Omega^k \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these induces a [[long exact sequence]] in cohomology. Since the sheaf of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions on a manifold admits [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]], the sheaf-cohomology {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} vanishes for {{math|''i'' &gt; 0}}. So the long exact cohomology sequences themselves ultimately separate into a chain of isomorphisms. At one end of the chain is the Čech cohomology and at the other lies the de Rham cohomology.

==Related ideas==
The de Rham cohomology has inspired many mathematical ideas, including [[Dolbeault cohomology]], [[Hodge theory]], and the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]]. However, even in more classical contexts, the theorem has inspired a number of developments. Firstly, the [[Hodge theory]] proves that there is an isomorphism between the cohomology consisting of harmonic forms and the de Rham cohomology consisting of closed forms modulo exact forms. This relies on an appropriate definition of harmonic forms and of the Hodge theorem. For further details see [[Hodge theory]].

===Harmonic forms===
{{see also|Harmonic differential}}
If {{mvar|M}} is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then each equivalence class in &lt;math&gt;H^k_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one [[harmonic form]]. That is, every member {{mvar|ω}} of a given equivalence class of closed forms can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \alpha + \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|α}} is exact and {{mvar|γ}} is harmonic: {{math|Δ''γ'' {{=}} 0}}.

Any [[harmonic function]] on a compact connected Riemannian manifold is a constant. Thus, this particular representative element can be understood to be an extremum (a minimum) of all cohomologously equivalent forms on the manifold. For example, on a {{math|2}}-[[torus]], one may envision a constant {{math|1}}-form as one where all of the "hair" is combed neatly in the same direction (and all of the "hair" having the same length). In this case, there are two cohomologically distinct combings; all of the others are linear combinations. In particular, this implies that the 1st [[Betti number]] of a {{math|2}}-torus is two. More generally, on an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional torus {{math|''T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, one can consider the various combings of {{mvar|k}}-forms on the torus. There are {{mvar|n}} choose {{mvar|k}} such combings that can be used to form the basis vectors for &lt;math&gt;H^k_{\text{dR}}(T^n)&lt;/math&gt;; the {{mvar|k}}-th Betti number for the de Rham cohomology group for the {{mvar|n}}-torus is thus {{mvar|n}} choose {{mvar|k}}.

More precisely, for a [[differential manifold]] {{mvar|M}}, one may equip it with some auxiliary [[Riemannian metric]]. Then the [[Laplacian]] {{math|Δ}} is defined by 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=d\delta+\delta d&lt;/math&gt;
 
with {{mvar|d}} the [[exterior derivative]] and {{mvar|δ}} the [[codifferential]]. The Laplacian is a homogeneous (in [[graded algebra|grading]]) [[linear]] [[differential operator]] acting upon the [[exterior algebra]] of [[differential form]]s: we can look at its action on each component of degree {{mvar|k}} separately. 

If {{mvar|M}} is [[Compact space|compact]] and [[oriented]], the [[dimension]] of the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the Laplacian acting upon the space of [[differential form|{{mvar|k}}-form]]s is then equal (by [[Hodge theory]]) to that of the de Rham cohomology group in degree {{mvar|k}}: the Laplacian picks out a unique ''harmonic'' form in each cohomology class of [[closed form (calculus)|closed form]]s. In particular, the space of all harmonic {{mvar|k}}-forms on {{mvar|M}} is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;H^k(M;\R).&lt;/math&gt; The dimension of each such space is finite, and is given by the {{mvar|k}}-th [[Betti number]].

===Hodge decomposition===
Let {{math|''M''}} be a [[Compact space|compact]] [[oriented manifold|oriented]] [[Riemannian manifold]].  The ''Hodge decomposition'' states that any {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} uniquely splits into the sum of three [[lp space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] components:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \alpha + \beta + \gamma ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''α''}} is exact, {{math|''β''}} is co-exact, and {{mvar|γ}} is harmonic.

One says that a form {{math|''β''}} is co-closed if {{math|''δβ'' {{=}} 0}} and co-exact if {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''δη''}} for some form {{math|''η''}}, and that {{math|''γ''}} is harmonic if {{math|Δ''γ'' {{=}} 0}}. This follows by noting that exact and co-exact forms are orthogonal; the orthogonal complement then consists of forms that are both closed and co-closed: that is, of harmonic forms. Here, orthogonality is defined with respect to the [[lp space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] inner product on {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)=\int_M \alpha \wedge {\star\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

By use of [[Sobolev space]]s or [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], the decomposition can be extended for example to a complete (oriented or not) Riemannian manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Demailly, [https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/manuscripts/agbook.pdf Complex Analytic and Differential Geometry] Ch VIII, § 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''degenerate case''' is a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] in which an element of a class of [[mathematical object|objects]] is qualitatively different from the rest of the class and hence belongs to another, usually simpler, class. '''Degeneracy''' is the condition of being a degenerate case.

The definitions of many classes of composite or structured objects include (often implicitly) inequalities. For example, the [[angle]]s and the side lengths of a [[triangle]] are supposed to be positive. The limiting cases, where one or several of these inequalities become equalities, are degeneracies. In the case of triangles, one has a ''degenerate triangle'' if at least one side length or angle is zero.

Often, the degenerate cases are the exceptional cases where changes to the usual [[dimension]] or the [[cardinality]] of the object (or of some part of it) occur. For example, a triangle is an object of dimension two, and a degenerate triangle is contained in a [[line (mathematics)|line]], and its dimension is thus one. Similarly, the [[solution set]] of a [[system of equations]] that depends on [[parameter]]s generally has a fixed cardinality and dimension, but cardinality and/or dimension may be different for some exceptional values, called degenerate cases. In such a degenerate case, the solution set is said to be degenerate.

For some classes of composite objects, the degenerate cases depend on the properties that are specifically studied. In particular, the class of objects may often be defined or characterized by systems of equations. Commonly, a given class of objects may be defined by several different systems of equations, and these different systems of equations may lead to different degenerate cases, while characterizing the same non-degenerate cases. This may be the reason for which there is no general definition of degeneracy, although the concept is widely used, and defined, if needed, in each specific situation.

A degenerate case thus has special features, which makes it [[generic property|non-generic]]. However, not all non-generic cases are degenerate. For example, [[right triangle]]s, [[isosceles triangle]]s and [[equilateral triangle]]s are non-generic and non-degenerate. Frequently, degenerate cases correspond to [[singularity theory|singularities]] either in the object or in some [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]. For example, a [[conic section]] is degenerate if and only if it has singular points.

==In geometry==

===Conic section===
{{Main|Degenerate conic}}

A degenerate conic is a [[conic section]] (a second-degree [[plane curve]], defined by a [[polynomial equation]] of degree two)  that fails to be an  [[irreducible variety|irreducible curve]].
* A [[Point (geometry)|point]] is a degenerate [[circle]], namely one with radius&amp;nbsp;0.
* The [[line (mathematics)|line]] is a degenerate case of a [[parabola]] if the parabola resides on a [[tangent plane]]. In [[inversive geometry]], a line is a degenerate case of a [[circle]], with infinite radius.
* Two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines also form a degenerate parabola.
* A [[line segment]] can be viewed as a degenerate case of an [[ellipse]] in which the [[semiminor axis]] goes to zero, the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] go to the endpoints, and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] goes to one.
* An ellipse can also degenerate into a single point.
* A [[hyperbola]] can degenerate into two lines crossing at a point, through a family of hyperbolae having those lines as common [[asymptote]]s.

===Triangle===
* A degenerate [[triangle]] has [[collinear]] vertices and zero area, and thus coincides with a segment covered twice (if the three vertices are not all equal; otherwise, the triangle degenerates to a single point). If the three vertices are pairwise distinct, it has two 0° angles and one 180° angle. If two vertices are equal, it has one 0° angle and two undefined angles.

===Rectangle===
* A line segment is a degenerate case of a [[rectangle]] which has a side of length&amp;nbsp;0.
* For any non-empty subset &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a bounded, axis-aligned degenerate rectangle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;math&gt;R \triangleq \left\{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n: x_i = c_i \ (\text{for } i\in S) \text{ and } a_i \leq x_i \leq b_i \ (\text{for } i \notin S)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--
  --&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \triangleq [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_i, b_i, c_i&lt;/math&gt; are constant (with &lt;math&gt;a_i \leq b_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;). The number of degenerate sides of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the number of elements of the subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, there may be as few as one degenerate "side" or as many as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (in which case &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; reduces to a singleton point).

===Convex polygon===
* A [[convex polygon]] is degenerate if at least two consecutive sides coincide at least partially, or at least one side has zero length, or at least one angle is 180°. Thus a degenerate convex polygon of ''n'' sides looks like a polygon with fewer sides. In the case of triangles, this definition coincides with the one that has been given above.

===Convex polyhedron===
* A [[convex polyhedron]] is degenerate if either two adjacent facets are [[coplanar]] or two edges are aligned. In the case of a [[tetrahedron]], this is equivalent to saying that all of its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] lie in the same [[plane (geometry)|plane]], giving it zero [[volume]].

===Standard torus===
* In contexts where self-intersection is allowed, a [[sphere]] is a degenerate [[standard torus]] where the axis of revolution passes through the center of the generating circle, rather than outside it.

===Sphere===
* When the radius of a sphere goes to zero, the resulting degenerate sphere of zero volume is a [[point (geometry)|point]].

===Other===
* See [[general position]] for other examples.

==Elsewhere==
* A set containing a single point is a degenerate [[Linear continuum|continuum]].
* Objects such as the [[digon]] and [[monogon]] can be viewed as degenerate cases of [[polygon]]s: valid in a general abstract mathematical sense, but not part of the original Euclidean conception of polygons.
* A [[random variable]] which can only take one value has a [[degenerate distribution]]; if that value is the real number 0, its probability density is the [[Dirac delta function]].
* Similarly, [[root of a function|roots]] of a [[polynomial]] are said to be ''degenerate'' if they coincide, since generically the ''n'' roots of an ''n''th degree polynomial are all distinct. This usage carries over to eigenproblems: a degenerate [[eigenvalue]] (i.e. a multiple coinciding root of the [[characteristic polynomial]]) is one that has more than one linearly independent [[eigenvector]].
* In [[quantum mechanics]] any such [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] in the eigenvalues of the [[Hamiltonian operator]] gives rise to [[degenerate energy level]]s.  Usually any such degeneracy indicates some underlying [[symmetry]] in the system.

'''Diesel therapy''' is a form of punishment in which prisoners are shackled and then transported for days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt; 
 While some see it as deliberate puishment, it is usually just the result of a transport network run for the convenience of law enforcement and not the prisoners.  One van may make a journey from Washington D.C. to Atlanta and take 10 days to arrive, but that is because over the journey many different passengers are picked up and dropped off along the way in destinations that are not along the direct route.{{citation|volume=38|publisher=Willamette L.

In [[economics]], '''discounted utility''' is the [[utility (economics)|utility]] (desirability) of some future event, such as consuming a certain amount of a good, as perceived at the present time as opposed to at the time of its occurrence. It is calculated as the [[present discounted value]] of future utility, and for people with [[time preference]] for sooner rather than later gratification, it is less than the future utility. The utility of an event ''x''  occurring at future time ''t'' under utility function ''u'', discounted back to the present (time 0) using [[exponential discounting|discount factor]] &lt;math&gt;\beta,&lt;/math&gt; Is

:&lt;math&gt;\beta ^t u(x_t).&lt;/math&gt;

Since more distant events are less liked, &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Discounted utility calculations made for events at various points in the future as well as at the present take the form 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=0}^T \beta ^t u(x_t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u(x_t)&lt;/math&gt; is the utility of some choice &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and ''T''  is the time of the most distant future satisfaction event. Here, since utility comparisons are being made across time when the utilities are combined in a single evaluation, the utility function is necessarily [[cardinal utility|cardinal]] in nature.

In a typical [[intertemporal consumption]] model, the above summation of utilities discounted from various future times would be maximized with respect to the amounts ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed in each period, [[constrained optimization|subject to]] an [[intertemporal budget constraint]] that says that the [[present value]] of current and future expenditures does not exceed the present value of financial resources available for spending.

The interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is not straightforward.  Sometimes it is explained as the degree of a person's patience.  Given the interpretation of [[homo economicus|economic agents]] as [[Rationality|rational]], this exempts time-valuations from rationality judgments, so that someone who spends and borrows voraciously is just as rational as someone who spends and saves moderately, or as someone who hoards his wealth and never spends it: different people have different rates of time preference.

Some formulations treat &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; not as a constant, but as a function &lt;math&gt;\beta (t) &lt;/math&gt; that itself varies over time, for example in models which use the concept of [[hyperbolic discounting]].  This view is consistent with [[empirical]] observations that humans display inconsistent [[time preference]]s.  For example, experiments by [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] showed that the same people who would choose 1 candy bar now over 2 candy bars tomorrow, would choose 2 candy bars 101 days from now over 1 candy bar 100 days from now.  (This is inconsistent because if the same question were posed 100 days from now, the person would ostensibly again choose 1 candy bar immediately instead of 2 candy bars the next day.)

Despite arguments about how &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; should be interpreted, the basic idea is that all [[ceteris paribus|other things equal]], the agent prefers to have something now as opposed to later (hence &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">The '''driver scheduling problem''' (DSP) is type of problem in [[operations research]] and [[theoretical computer science]].

The DSP consists of selecting a set of duties (assignments) for the drivers or pilots of vehicles (e.g., buses, trains, boats, or planes) involved in the transportation of passengers or goods.&lt;ref name="VoßDaduna2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voß|first1=Stefan|last2=Daduna|first2=Joachim R.|title=Computer Aided Scheduling of Public Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsvzwUiUBIsC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540422433|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salvendy2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salvendy|first=Gavriel|title=Handbook of Industrial Engineering: Technology and Operations Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjY3IZ9Unv0C&amp;pg=PA813|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2001-05-25|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471330578|pages=813–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This very complex problem involves several constraints related to labour and company rules and also different evaluation criteria and objectives. Being able to solve this problem efficiently can have a great impact on costs and quality of service for public transportation companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borndörfer|first=Ralf|author2=Martin Grötschel | author2-link = Martin Grötschel |author3=Marc E. Pfetsch |title=Public transport to the fORe|journal=OR/MS Today|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2|pages=30–40|url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-4-06/frtransport.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large number of different rules that a feasible duty might be required to satisfy, such as
*Minimum and maximum stretch duration
*Minimum and maximum break duration
*Minimum and maximum work duration
*Minimum and maximum total duration
*Maximum extra work duration
*Maximum number of vehicle changes
*Minimum driving duration of a particular vehicle
[[Operations research]] has provided [[optimization]] models and [[algorithm]]s that lead to efficient solutions for this problem. Among the most common models proposed to solve the DSP are the [[Set covering|Set Covering]] and Set Partitioning Models (SPP/SCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=H.R. |author2=Paixão, J.P. |author3=Portugal, R.|title=Driver Scheduling Problem Modelling|journal=Public Transport: Planning and Operations|year=2009|volume=1|issue=2|pages=103–120|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12469-008-0007-0|doi=10.1007/s12469-008-0007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=H.R. |author2=Paixão, J.P. |author3=Portugal, R.|title=The crew-scheduling module in the GIST system|journal=Economic Working Papers Series, Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra|year=2001|volume=547|url=http://www.econ.upf.edu/en/research/onepaper.php?id=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the SPP model, each work piece (task) is covered by only one duty. In the SCP model, it is possible to have more than one duty covering a given work piece.
In both models, the set of work pieces that needs to be covered is laid out in rows, and the set of previously defined feasible duties available for covering specific work pieces is arranged in columns. The DSP resolution, based on either of these models, is the selection of the set of feasible duties that guarantees that there is one (SPP) or more (SCP) duties covering each work piece while minimizing the total cost of the final schedule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">The '''effective selfing model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that describes the [[mating system]] of a [[plant]] [[population]] in terms of the degree of [[self-fertilisation]] present.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ritland, Kermit | year = 1984 | title = The effective proportion of self-fertilisation with consanguineous matings in inbred populations | journal = Genetics | volume = 106 | pages = 139–152 | pmid = 17246188 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1202242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A.

S.]] | title = Isozymes in Plant Biology | pages = 73–86 | publisher = Dioscorides Press | location = Portland|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in the 1980s by Kermit Ritland, as an alternative to the simplistic [[mixed mating model]]. The mixed mating model assumes that every [[fertilisation]] event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or [[outcrossing]] with a completely [[random]] mate. That is, it assumes that [[inbreeding]] is caused solely by self-fertilisation. This assumption is often violated in wild plant populations, where inbreeding may be due to outcrossing between closely related plants. For example, in dense stands, mating often occurs between plants in close proximity; and in plants with short [[seed dispersal]] distances, plants are often closely related to their nearest neighbours. When both these criteria are met, plants will tend to be closely related to the near neighbours with which they mate, resulting in significant inbreeding. In such a scenario, the mixed mating model will attribute all inbreeding to self-fertilisation, and therefore overestimate the extent of self-fertilisation occurring. The effective selfing model takes into account the potential for inbreeding to occur as a result of outcrossing between closely related plants, by considering the extent of kinship between mates.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

Ultimately, it is not possible to tease apart the two potential causes of inbreeding, and attributed the observed inbreeding to one cause or the other. Therefore, just as with the mixed mating model, in the effective selfing model there is only one parameter to be estimated. However this parameter, termed the '''effective selfing rate''', is often a more accurate measure of the proportion of self-fertilisation than the corresponding parameter in the mixed mating model.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom''' was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jewish]] population. The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.

==Freedom for Catholics bodes well for Jews==
When in 1829 the [[Roman Catholic]]s of the United Kingdom were freed from all their [[civil disabilities]], the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when [[William Huskisson]] presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of [[Liverpool]]. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by [[Robert Grant (MP)|Robert Grant]] on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British [[legislature]] in one form or another for the next thirty years. [[Thomas Macaulay]], later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSDOCMACAULAYJEWS.htm Macaulay's speech on the exclusion of Jews from parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the bill failed to get through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Against the opposition of [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the [[Duke of Wellington]] speaking and voting against the Bill, though the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of [[Westminster]]. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King [[William IV of England|William IV]] was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to make the annual appeal to [[British Parliament|Parliament]], as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field{{Vague|date=November 2015}}; but by the passing of the [[Sheriffs' Declaration Act]]{{Dubious |Transferring accuracy challenge from hidden comment to talk page |reason=Hidden comment on page asserts that there is no such act and the link is a redlink |date=November 2015}} on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff.{{fact|date=April 2014}} In the following year the [[Jew Bill]] was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of parliament==
[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who was born Jewish and  baptised aged 12 into the [[Church of England]], was a member of parliament from 1837, served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].  He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and [[Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the [[Religious Opinions Relief Act]] removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the [[Established Church]]; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, [[Lionel de Rothschild]], was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

[[David Salomons]], who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The [[Prime minister]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected [[Lord Mayor of London]].

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the ''[[Jews Relief Act 1858]]'' by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian."

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting "so help me, [[Jehovah]]" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859.  Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The [[Reform Act 1867]] granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the [[Universities Tests Act]] removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild]] was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made [[Earl of Beaconsfield]]. They were followed within a few years by [[Henry de Worms, 1st Baron Pirbright|Henry de Worms]] as Lord Pirbright and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|Sydney Stern]] as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the [[British Empire]]  were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] and of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] acted as solicitor-general in [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry. But from the time of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under [[Secretary of State]] in one of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s ministries, while Sir [[Julian Goldsmid]], a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] after the [[Home Rule]] policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]].

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the [[Goldsmid family]], which had been touched by the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian movement]]. In 1841 a [[Reform Jew|Reform]] congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the [[Spanish haham]] and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the [[United Synagogue]] (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the [[Chief Rabbi]] autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the [[British empire]]. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the [[Church of Ireland|Irish Church]], did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate [[haham]], and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|Alliance Israélite]], which had been weakened by the [[Franco-German war]]. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting false "blood libels"==
As early as 1840, when the [[blood libel against Jews|blood accusation]] was revived with regard to the [[Damascus affair]], and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the [[Board of Deputies]] at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the [[Mansion House, London]] (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the [[Sultan]] at [[Constantinople]], a [[firman (decree)|firman]] repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the [[Edgardo Mortara|Mortara]] affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to [[Morocco]] on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate [[Hebrews]] of the [[Danubian principalities]]. [[Francis Goldsmid]] made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of [[Serbia]] (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in [[Romania]]. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pogrom]] --&gt;
When in 1881 the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|outburst of violence in Russia]] brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in "[[The Times]]" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian [[refugee]]s from Brody was organised by the committee of the [[Mansion House Fund]]. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the [[Russian Jews|Russo-Jewish]] committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When [[Maurice de Hirsch]] formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The [[immigrant]]s being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=602&amp;letter=M#2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result of the Russian exodus===
"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While [[the Continent]] had seen the rise of strong [[anti-Semitic]] feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the "Semitic" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the "alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the [[East End of London]], of Eastern European Jews, had brought [[smallpox]] and [[scarlet fever]]. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. "&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Debates, 4th series, vol. 145, col.711.'' and ''L.Marks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4181">The '''European Public Hearing on European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism: 20 Years After''' was a European public hearing organised by the Czech [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the [[European Union]] in the [[European Parliament]] on 18 March 2009. The hearing was described by the Presidency as "the third step towards the establishment of a [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience|European Platform of Memory and Conscience]] to support the activities of institutions engaged in reconciling with totalitarian regimes in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/hearing-in-the-european-parliament-on-the-crimes-of-communism |title= Hearing in the European Parliament on the Crimes of Communism: Third step towards European platform of memory and conscience – a Czech Presidency initiative |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearing was hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs [[Alexandr Vondra]] and the Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to the European Union [[Milena Vicenová]] on behalf of the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union, in cooperation with [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s supporting the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism|Prague Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ustrcr.cz/data/pdf/tiskove_zpravy/hearing-brussels-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first session, chaired by [[Tunne Kelam]] MEP, included speeches by [[Pavel Žáček]] (Director, [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]]), Emmanuel Crabit ([[European Commission]] Directorate-General of Justice, Freedom and Security), [[Emanuelis Zingeris]] (Chairman, International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania), [[Marius Oprea]] ([[Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania]]), Hans Altendorf (Office of the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]]), Vasil Kadrinov ([[Hannah Arendt Center]]), [[Nicolas Werth]] (Institute for Contemporary History, [[CNRS]]), and Camilla Andersson ([[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]]).

The second session, chaired by [[Jana Hybášková]] MEP, included speeches by [[Alexandr Vondra]] (Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs of the Czech Republic), [[Ján Figeľ]] ([[European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth|European Commissioner for Education]]), [[Alejo Vidal-Quadras]] MEP ([[Vice President of the European Parliament]]), [[Jan Zahradil]] MEP, [[László Tökés]] MEP, and [[Sandra Kalniete]] (former European Commissioner).

The conclusions called for "the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience" and supported the proclamation of the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]].&lt;ref name=ConclusionsEUHearing2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Conclusions of the Public Hearing in the European Parliament  organised by the Czech Presidency of the European Union: European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism: 20 Years After|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/data/pdf/tiskove_zpravy/slyseni-brusel-final-conclusions.pdf|publisher=[[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union]]|accessdate=2011-05-14|date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">'''Event stream processing''', or '''ESP''', is a set of technologies designed to assist the construction of [[event-driven architecture|event-driven information systems]]. ESP technologies include event visualization, event databases, event-driven middleware, and event processing languages, or [[complex event processing]] (CEP). In practice, the terms ESP and CEP are often used interchangeably. ESP deals with the task of processing streams of event data with the goal of identifying the meaningful pattern within those streams, employing techniques such as detection of relationships between multiple events, event correlation, event hierarchies, and other aspects such as causality, membership and timing.

ESP enables many different applications such as [[algorithmic trading]] in financial services, [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) event processing applications, [[fraud detection]], [[process monitoring]], and [[location-based service]]s in telecommunications.

==Examples==
By way of illustration, the following code fragments demonstrate detection of patterns within event streams. The first is an example of processing a data stream using a continuous [[SQL]] query (a query that executes forever processing arriving data based on timestamps and window duration). This code fragment illustrates a JOIN of two data streams, one for stock orders, and one for the resulting stock trades. The query outputs a stream of all Orders matched by a Trade within one second of the Order being placed. The output stream is sorted by timestamp, in this case, the timestamp from the Orders stream.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT DataStream
   Orders.TimeStamp, Orders.orderId, Orders.ticker,
   Orders.amount, Trade.amount
FROM Orders
JOIN Trades OVER (RANGE INTERVAL '1' SECOND FOLLOWING)
ON Orders.orderId = Trades.orderId;
&lt;/source&gt;

Another sample code fragment detects weddings among a flow of external "events" such as church bells ringing, the appearance of a man in a tuxedo or morning suit, a woman in a flowing white gown and rice flying through the air. A "complex" or "composite" event is what one infers from the individual simple events: a wedding is happening.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
WHEN Person.Gender EQUALS "man" AND Person.Clothes EQUALS "tuxedo"
FOLLOWED-BY
  Person.Clothes EQUALS "gown" AND
  (Church_Bell OR Rice_Flying)
WITHIN 2 hours
ACTION Wedding
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2850">In [[mathematics]], the term '''fiber''' (or '''fibre''' in [[British English]]) can have two meanings, depending on the context:

# In [[naive set theory]], the '''fiber''' of the [[Element (mathematics)|element]] ''y'' in the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Y'' under a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is the [[inverse image]] of the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] &lt;math&gt;\{y\}&lt;/math&gt; under ''f''.
# In [[algebraic geometry]], the notion of a fiber of a [[morphism]] of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] must be defined more carefully because, in general, not every point is closed.

== Definitions ==

===Fiber in naive set theory===
Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} be a [[Map (mathematics)|map]]. The '''fiber''' of an element &lt;math&gt;y \in Y,&lt;/math&gt; commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y),&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math display="block"&gt;f^{-1}(y) := \{x \in X \mid f(x) = y\}.&lt;/math&gt; That is, the fiber of ''y'' under ''f'' is the set of elements in the domain of ''f'' that are mapped to ''y''.

The [[inverse image]] or preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the concept of the fiber to subsets &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; of the codomain. The notation &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is still used to refer to the fiber, as the fiber of an element ''y'' is the preimage of the singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{y\}&lt;/math&gt;, as in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{y\})&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the fiber can be treated as a function from the codomain to the [[powerset]] of the domain: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} : Y \to \mathcal{P}(X),&lt;/math&gt; while the preimage generalizes this to a function between powersets: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} : \mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' maps into the real numbers, so &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is simply a number, then the fiber &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is also called the '''[[level set]]''' of ''y'' under ''f'': &lt;math&gt;L_y(f).&lt;/math&gt; If ''f'' is a [[continuous function]] and ''y'' is in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f'', then the level set of ''y'' under ''f'' is a curve in [[Two-dimensional space|2D]], a surface in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]], and, more generally, a [[hypersurface]] of [[dimension]] {{nowrap|''d'' − 1.}}

===Fiber in algebraic geometry===
In [[algebraic geometry]], if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is a morphism of schemes, the '''fiber''' of a point ''p'' in ''Y'' is the [[fiber product of schemes]] 
:&lt;math&gt;X\times_Y \operatorname{Spec} k(p)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''k''(''p'') is the [[residue field]] at ''p''.

In mathematical [[thermal conduction|heat conduction]], the '''Green's function number''' is used to uniquely categorize certain [[fundamental solution]]s of the [[heat equation]] to make existing solutions easier to identify, store, and retrieve.

== Background ==

Numbers have long been used to identify types of boundary conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Luikov, A. V. (1968) Analytical Heat Diffusion Theory, Academic Press, {{ISBN|0124597564}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ozisik, M. N. (1980) Heat Conduction, John Wiley, p. 13, {{ISBN|047105481X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, A., Bialecki R., and Kurpisz, K. (1987) Evaluating eigenvalues for boundary value problems of heat conduction in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, Int. J for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 24, 419 - 445.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Green's function number system was proposed 
by Beck and Litkouhi in 1988&lt;ref&gt;Beck, J. V. and Litkouhi, B, (1988) Heat conduction number system, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 31, 505-515.&lt;/ref&gt;
and has seen increasing use since then.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Nimr, M. A.  and Alkam, M. K.  (1997) A generalized thermal boundary condition, Heat and Mass Transfer, v. 33, pp. 157 – 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Monte, F. (2006) Multi-layer transient heat conduction using transition time scales, Int. Journal Thermal Sciences, v. 45, pp. 882 – 892.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, G. (2010) A general modal-based numerical simulation of transient heat conduction in a one dimensional homogeneous slab, Energy and Buildings, v. 42, no. 12, pp. 2309 – 2322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, D. and Haji-Sheikh, A. (2012) A view of the thermal wave behaviors in thin plates, International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, v. 39, No. 8, pp. 1009-1017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Y. (2012) Heat conduction in a semi-infinite body with power-type initial and boundary conditions, International Journal of Thermophysics, v. 33, No. 12, pp. 2390-2406.&lt;/ref&gt; The number system has been used to catalog a large collection of Green’s functions and related solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, K.D., Beck, J. V., Haji-Sheikh, A., and Litkouhi, B. (2011), Heat Conduction Using Green's Functions,Taylor and Francis, (2nd ed.)  {{ISBN|9781439813546}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green's Function Library, http://www.greensfunction.unl.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Exact Analytical Conduction Toolbox, http://exact.unl.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although described here for solutions of the [[heat equation]], this number system could also be used
for any phenomena described by [[differential equation]]s 
such as [[diffusion]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]],
[[fluid dynamics]], etc.

==Notation==
The Green's function number specifies the [[coordinate system]] and the type of [[boundary condition]]s that a [[Green's function]] satisfies. The Green's function number has two parts, a letter designation followed by a number designation.  The letter(s) designate the coordinate system while the numbers designate the type of boundary conditions that are satisfied.

Some of the designations for the Greens function number system are given next. Coordinate system designations include:  X, Y, and Z for Cartesian coordinates; R, Z, &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; for cylindrical coordinates; and, RS, &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; for spherical coordinates. 
Designations for several boundary conditions are given in Table 1. The zeroth boundary condition is important for identifying the presence of a coordinate boundary where no physical boundary exists, for example, far away in a semi-infinite body or at the center of a cylindrical or spherical body.

== Examples in Cartesian coordinates ==

=== X11 ===

As an example, number X11 denotes the Green's function that satisfies the heat equation 
in the domain (0 &lt; x &lt; L) for boundary conditions of type 1 ([[Dirichlet boundary condition|Dirichlet]]) 
at both boundaries x = 0 and x = L.  
Here '''X''' denotes the Cartesian coordinate and '''11''' denotes the type 1 boundary condition 
at both sides of the body. The [[boundary value problem]] for the X11 Green’s function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} +\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \delta(x - x')
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; &amp;\;\; 0 &lt; x &lt; L;   \;\;\; t&gt;0      \\
G |_{x=0}=0; \;\; G |_{x=L}=0; \;\; G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0. &amp;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal diffusivity]] (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s) and &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the
[[Dirac delta function]].

=== X20 ===

As another Cartesian example, number X20 denotes the Green's function in the 
semi-infinite body (&lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt;) with a Neumann (type 2) boundary at x = 0.  Here '''X''' 
denotes the Cartesian coordinate, '''2''' denotes the type 2 boundary condition 
at x = 0 and '''0''' denotes the zeroth type boundary condition (boundedness) at &lt;math&gt;  x = \infty &lt;/math&gt;.  
The [[boundary value problem]] for the X20 Green's function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} +\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \delta(x - x')
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; &amp; \;\; 0 &lt; x &lt; \infty;   \;\;\; t&gt;0 \\
\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial n} |_{x=0}=0; \;\; 
G |_{x\rightarrow \infty} \mbox{ is bounded}; \;\; G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0. &amp;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== X10Y20 ===

As a two-dimensional example, number X10Y20 denotes the Green's function in the quarter-infinite body
(&lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;y&lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt;) with a Dirichlet (type 1) boundary at x = 0
and a Neumann (type 2) boundary at y = 0.  The [[boundary value problem]] for the X10Y20 Green's function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} +\dfrac{\partial^2 G}{\partial y^2} +\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \delta(x - x')  \delta(y - y')
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; &amp; \;\; 0 &lt; x &lt; \infty; \;\; 0 &lt; y &lt; \infty;   \;\;\; t&gt;0 \\
G |_{x=0} = 0; \;\;
\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial n} |_{y=0}=0; \;\; &amp; \\
G |_{x\rightarrow \infty} \mbox{ is bounded}; \;\; G |_{y\rightarrow \infty} \mbox{ is bounded}; \;\; G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0. &amp;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples in cylindrical coordinates ==

=== R03 ===

As an example in the cylindrical coordinate system, number R03 denotes the Green's function 
that satisfies the heat equation in the solid cylinder (0 &lt; r &lt; a) with a boundary condition 
of type 3 (Robin) at r = a.  Here letter '''R''' denotes the cylindrical coordinate system, 
number '''0''' denotes the zeroth boundary condition (boundedness) at the center of the 
cylinder (r = 0), and number '''3''' denotes the type 3 ([[Robin boundary condition|Robin]]) 
boundary condition at r = a.  
The boundary value problem for R03 Green's function is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{1}{r}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial r} \right) 
+\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \dfrac{\delta(r - r')}{2 \pi r'}
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; \;\; 0 &lt; r &lt; a; \;\;\; t&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
G |_{r=0} \mbox{ is bounded}; \;\;k \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial n} |_{r=a} + hG |_{r=a} =0; \;\; 
 G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is [[thermal conductivity]] (W/(m K)) and &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; is the
[[heat transfer coefficient]] (W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K)).

=== R10 ===

As another example, number R10 denotes the Green’s function in a large body containing a 
cylindrical void (a &lt; r &lt; &lt;math&gt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;) with a type 1 (Dirichlet) boundary condition at r = a.  
Again letter '''R''' denotes the cylindrical coordinate system, number '''1''' denotes the 
type 1 boundary at r = a, and number '''0''' denotes the type zero boundary (boundedness) 
at large values of r. The boundary value problem for the R10 Green’s function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dfrac{1}{r}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial r} \right) 
+\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \dfrac{\delta(r - r')}{2 \pi r'}
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; &amp;\;\; a &lt; r &lt; \infty; \;\;\; t&gt;0  \\
G |_{r=a} = 0; \;\;G |_{r\rightarrow \infty} \mbox{ is bounded}; \;\; G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0. &amp;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== R01&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;00 ===

As a two dimensional example, number R01&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;00 denotes the Green’s function in a
solid cylinder with angular dependence, with a type 1 (Dirichlet) boundary condition at r = a.  
Here letter '''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;''' denotes the angular coordinate, and numbers '''00''' denote the 
type zero boundaries for angle; here no physical boundary takes the form of the periodic boundary
condition.  The boundary value problem for the R01&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;00 Green’s function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dfrac{1}{r}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial r} \right) 
+ \dfrac{1}{r^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 G}{\partial \phi^2} + 
\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \dfrac{\delta(r - r')}{2 \pi r'}  \delta(\phi -  \phi ')
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; &amp;\;\; 0 &lt; r &lt; a; \;\;\;  0&lt;\phi &lt; 2\pi; \;\;\; t&gt;0 \\
G |_{r=0} \mbox{ is bounded,} \;\;G |_{r=a} =0; &amp;\\
G |_{\phi=0} = G |_{\phi=2 \pi}; \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial \phi}|_{\phi=0} = \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial \phi} |_{\phi=2 \pi};    \;\;       G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0. &amp;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Example in spherical coordinates ==

=== RS02 ===

As an example in the spherical coordinate system, number RS02 denotes the Green’s function 
for a solid sphere (0 &lt; r &lt; b ) with a type 2 ([[Neumann boundary condition|Neumann]]) 
boundary condition at r = b.  
Here letters '''RS''' denote the radial-spherical coordinate system, number '''0''' denotes 
the zeroth boundary condition (boundedness) at r=0, and number '''2''' denotes the type 2 
boundary at r = b.  The boundary value problem for the RS02 Green’s function is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{1}{r^2}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial r} \right) 
+\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t -  \tau) \dfrac{\delta(r - r')}{4 \pi r^2}
     = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; \;\; 0 &lt; r &lt; b; \;\;\; t&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
G |_{r=0} \mbox{ is bounded}; \;\; \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial n} |_{r=b} =0; \;\; 
 G |_{t&lt;\tau}=0. 
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research''' ('''HIIK''') is an independent and interdisciplinary registered association located at the Department of Political Science at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Since 1991, the HIIK has been committed to the distribution of knowledge about the emergence, course and settlement of interstate and intrastate political conflicts. The Conflict Barometer is published annually and contains the current research results.

== Conflict Barometer ==
The HIIK's annual publication '''Conflict Barometer''' describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. [[Coup d'état]], attempted coups d'états, as well as implemented measures of conflict resolution are also reported. It is subdivided into five world regions and presents all present conflicts in detailed charts and short descriptions. The methodological approach consists of the conflict definition and the measuring of the conflict intensity.

== Methodology after 2011 ==
Following a methodological revision in 2011, changes in the Heidelberg methodology included allocating intensities not only based on state units and calendar years, but also on the level of subnational units and calendar months. Furthermore, the establishment of intensities now follows an analysis of clearly conceived proxy indicators, used for the assessment of means and consequences of a conflict measure. This analysis continues to be based on the actions of conflict actors, as well as the communication between them. Through the conceptual refinement and standardization of data collection and documentation, the HIIK data achieves a higher degree of precision, reliability, and comprehensibility regarding information on political conflicts.

== Conflict definition ==
A political conflict is a positional difference between at least two assertive and directly involved actors regarding values relevant to a society (the conflict items including (territory, [[secession]], [[decolonization]], [[autonomy]], [[Ideology|system/ideology]], [[national power]], [[regional predominance]], [[international power]], [[Resource (economics)|resources]], other)) which is carried out using observable and interrelated conflict measures that lie outside established regulatory procedures and threaten core state functions, the international order, or hold the prospect of doing so.
	According to the Heidelberg (1998) methodology and ideology, the essence of a political conflict lies in a contradiction, adequately represented by the concept of a “positional difference”: a positional difference is a perceived incompatibility of ideas and beliefs. It presupposes the presence of the following elements:
(1) There must be at least two entities possessing intellectual capacity and vision, and who are capable of communicating. Such an entity is called an actor.
(2) In order for the actors to sense incompatibility between their ideas and beliefs, there must be reciprocal actions and acts of communication between said actors. These actions and acts of communication are called measures.
(3) A communicating act always refers to a specific issue, an action always refers to a certain object. The subject behind a measure is called item.
For the purpose of defining the term political conflict more precisely, the three elements aforementioned shall be further defined. These elements are necessary requirements for the existence of a political conflict.

| Non-violent Crisis
| A political conflict is classified as a non-violent crisis if physical violence is being implicitly or explicitly threatened to persons or property by at least one of the actors, or if one actor uses physical violence against property, without regarding the injury of people as acceptable. A threat of force is understood as a verbally or non-verbally communicated prospect of violent measures that is based on the conflict item. An acceptance of the injury of persons is present when the use of force against property includes the possibility of the injury of people but the violator is indifferent to this possibility.

An '''invasive species''' is a species that is not native to a specific location (an [[introduced species]]), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ecosystem Consequences of Biological Invasions |author=Joan G.

The term as most often used applies to introduced species (also called "non-indigenous" or "non-native") that adversely affect the [[habitat]]s and [[bioregion]]s they invade economically, environmentally, or ecologically. Such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region, [[Wilderness|wilderness areas]], particular habitats, or [[wildland–urban interface]] land from loss of natural controls (such as [[Predation|predators]] or [[herbivore]]s). This includes non-native invasive plant species labeled as '''exotic pest plants''' and '''invasive exotics''' growing in native [[plant community|plant communities]].&lt;ref&gt;Exotic Pest Plant Council. '[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plants of Greatest Ecological Concern in California]' accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in this sense by government organizations&lt;ref&gt;(September 21, 2006).

The term is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for [[noxious weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plant Council]. p. 1. accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kudzu|kudzu vine]] (''Pueraria lobata''), [[Cortaderia jubata|Andean pampas grass]] (''Cortaderia jubata''), and [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis'') are examples.

Dispersal and subsequent proliferation of species is not solely an anthropogenic phenomenon. There are many mechanisms by which species from all Kingdoms have been able to travel across continents in short periods of time such as via floating rafts, or on wind currents. Charles Darwin performed many experiments to better understand long distance seed dispersal, and was able to germinate seeds from insect frass, faeces of waterfowl, dirt clods on the feet of birds, all of which may have traveled significant distances under their own power, or be blown off course by thousands of miles.

Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio-regions is a natural phenomenon, which has likely been accelerated via hominid-assisted migration although this has not been adequately directly measured.

The definition of "native" is controversial in that there is no way to precisely determine nativity. For example, the ancestors of Equus ferus (modern horses) evolved in North America and radiated to Eurasia before becoming locally extinct. Upon returning to North America in 1493 during their hominid-assisted migration, it is debatable as to whether they were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.

==Causes==
Scientists include species and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that, when combined, establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.

===Species based mechanisms===
While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete [[native species]]. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.

Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers. One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.&lt;ref name="kolar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kolar |first=C.S. |author2=D.M.

Typically, an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location.&lt;ref name="tilm"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tilman|first=D. |year=2004

| pmid = 15243158 |issue= 30 |pmc= 503710}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low population densities, it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location, so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established. Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment (also known as a high [[propagule pressure]]).&lt;ref name="verl"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Verling|first=E. |author2=G.M.

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as [[nutrient]]s, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great [[Competition (biology)|competition]] or [[predation]], then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly. Ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as [[zero-sum]] systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such [[unilateral]] competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule.&lt;ref name="stoh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |author2= D. Binkley |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0025:EPSIHS]2.0.CO;2|last3=Chong |first3=Geneva W. |last4=Kalkhan |first4=Mohammed A. |last5=Schell |first5=Lisa D. |last6=Bull |first6=Kelly A. |last7=Otsuki |first7=Yuka |last8=Newman |first8=Gregory |last9=Bashkin |first9=Michael |last10=Son |first10=Yowhan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sax"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sax |first= D.F. |author2= S.

An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long [[taproot]], or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass (''[[Aegilops triuncialis]]'') was introduced to [[California]] on [[serpentine soil]]s, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high [[magnesium]]/[[calcium]] ratio, and possible [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huenneke |first=L. |author2=S.

Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds, modifying [[abiotic]] factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, creating a positive or negative impact on other species. Some species, like ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Kalanchoe daigremontana]]'', produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic compounds]], that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species, and influence some soil processes like carbon and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="HERRERAFERRER-PARIS2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HERRERA|first1=Ileana|last2=FERRER-PARIS|first2=José R.|last3=BENZO|first3=Diana|last4=FLORES|first4=Saúl|last5=GARCÍA|first5=Belkis|last6=NASSAR|first6=Jafet M.|title=An Invasive Succulent Plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) Influences Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Mineralization in a Neotropical Semiarid Zone|journal=Pedosphere|volume=28|issue=4|year=2018|pages=632–643|issn=1002-0160|doi=10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species like ''[[Stapelia gigantea]]'' [[ecological facilitation|facilitates]] the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrera|first1=Ileana|last2=Ferrer-Paris|first2=José R.|last3=Hernández-Rosas|first3=José I.|last4=Nassar|first4=Jafet M.|title=Impact of two invasive succulents on native-seedling recruitment in Neotropical arid environments|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=2016|volume=132|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.04.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301927334|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples are ''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'' (yellow starthistle) and ''Centaurea diffusa'' ([[diffuse knapweed]]). These [[Eastern Europe]]an [[noxious weed]]s have spread through the [[Western United States|western]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast states]]. Experiments show that [[8-hydroxyquinoline]], a chemical produced at the root of ''C. diffusa'', has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. ''C. diffusa'' and ''C. solstitialis'' do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others. Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hierro |first=J.L. |author2=R.M. Callaway |year=2003 |title=Allelopathy and exotic plant invasion |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1026208327014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vivanco|first=J.M. |last2=Bais |first2=H.P. |last3=Stermitz |first3=F.R. |last4=Thelen |first4=G.C. |last5=Callaway |first5=R.M. |year=2004 |title=Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: Novel weapons and exotic invasion |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7|issue=4 |pages= 285–292 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by providing large amounts of dry [[detritus]] during the fire season in western North America. In areas where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing ''B. tectorum'' to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt; |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=42480&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species. For example, [[zebra mussel]]s increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which [[invertebrate]]s live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]], increases the density and diversity of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrate communities.&lt;ref name="silv"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Silver Botts |first=P. |last2=Patterson |first2=B.A. |last3=Schlosser |first3=D. |year=1996 |title=Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |volume= |issue=15 |pages= 179–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystem-based mechanisms===
In [[ecosystem]]s, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance, which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |year=2002 |title=Impact of non-indigenous species on natives enhanced by anthropogenic alteration of selection regimes |journal=Oikos |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=449–458 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970316.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When changes such as a [[forest fire]] occur, normal succession favors native [[grass]]es and [[forb]]s. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing them out. [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are often the limiting factors in these situations.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis|first=M.A. |last2=Grime |first2=J.P. |last3=Thompson |first3=K. |year=2000 |title=Fluctuating resources in plant communities: A general theory of invisibility |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=528–534 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00473.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every species occupies a ''[[Ecological niche|niche]]'' in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology|last=Fath|first=Brian D.|publisher=Elsevier Science; 1 edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0444520333|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type can be found within the ''[[Lampropholis delicata]]'' species of skink.

Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example, [[edge effect]]s describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alverson|first=William S.|last2=Waller|first2=Donald M.|last3=Solheim|first3=Stephen L.|date=1988|title=Forests Too Deer: Edge Effects in Northern Wisconsin|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00199.x|jstor=2386294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments. When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Cheng-Yuan|last2=Tang|first2=Shaoqing|last3=Fatemi|first3=Mohammad|last4=Gross|first4=Caroline L.|last5=Julien|first5=Mic H.|last6=Curtis|first6=Caitlin|last7=van Klinken|first7=Rieks D.|date=2015-09-01|title=Population structure and genetic diversity of invasive Phyla canescens: implications for the evolutionary potential|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=1–21|doi=10.1890/ES14-00374.1|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt; the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance. This conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name="Prentis 2008 288-294"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Prentis |first= Peter |title= Adaptive evolution in invasive species |journal= Trends in Plant Science |volume= 13|issue= 6 |pages= 288–294 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2008.03.004 |pmid= 18467157 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following invasion events, selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the environment. Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment. These responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change, or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey.&lt;ref name="Eunmi 2002 386-391"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lee |first= Carol Eunmi | title= Evolutionary genetics of invasive species |journal= Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume= 17 |issue= 8 |pages= 386–391 | doi = 10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02554-5 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations include changes in morphology, physiology, phenology, and plasticity.

Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment. Intraspecific phenotypic plasticity, pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name="Zenni 2013 635-644"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zenni |first= R.D. |title= Adaptive Evolution and Phenotypic Plasticity During Naturalization and Spread of Invasive Species: Implications for Tree Invasion Biology |journal= Biological Invasions |volume= 16 |issue= 3 |pages= 635–644 |doi=10.1007/s10530-013-0607-8 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit the individual in its environment. This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This, in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive.

This debate hinged on the [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scale]] at which invasion studies were performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives' ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |author2=E.G.

Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem.&lt;ref name="tilm"/&gt;

===Vectors===
Non-native species have many ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s'', including biogenic vectors,&lt;!--what is a biogenic vector?--&gt; but most invasions are associated with human activity. Natural [[Range (biology)|range]] extensions are common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassey |first= P |author2=T.M.

An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the [[Pacific rat]] (''Rattus exulans'') to Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matisoo-Smith |first=E. |author2=R.M.

[[File:EriocheirSinensis1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis'')]]
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for [[horticulture]]. The [[pet trade]] moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles.

The arrival of invasive [[propagule]]s to a new site is a function of the site's invasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leung |first=B. |author2=N.E. Mandrak  |year=2007 |title= The risk of establishment of aquatic invasive species: joining invasibility and propagule pressure |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=274 |pages=2733–2739|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2007.0841 |pmid=17711834 |issue=1625 |pmc=2275890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at home," American colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands. In 2008, U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles. [[Agricultural Research Service]] entomologists identified them as [[rhinoceros beetle]], [[hercules beetle]], and [[Phalacrognathus muelleri|king stag beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan10/insects0110.htm |title=Our Invaluable Invertebrate Collections |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these species were not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems.&lt;!--were they actually invasive or just non-native?--&gt; To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] programs such as [[Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance]] (SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.

Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, are essential to the ecosystem of that area. If they are removed from the location it could be harmful to that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zavaleta|first1=Erika|last2=Hobbs|first2=Richard|last3=Mooney|first3=Harold|title=Viewing invasive species removal in a whole-ecosystem context|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=August 2001|volume=16|issue=8|page=458|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/invasivesseminar_readings/Zavaleta_etal_2001.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02194-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable [[Chinese mitten crab]] is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marine Pollution and Climate Change|last=Seinfeld|first=John H.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==== Within the Aquatic Environment ====
The development of maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms are transported within the ocean. Two ways marine organisms are transported to new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar|first=Jennifer L|last2=Gamboa|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Revenga|first3=Carmen|last4=Spalding|first4=Mark D|date=2008|title=Assessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=485–492|doi=10.1890/070064|issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1010 Discharging ballast water.jpg|thumb|Cargo ship de-ballasting]]
Many marine organisms have the capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls. Therefore, these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=John|date=2007|title=Hull fouling is a risk factor for intercontinental species exchange in aquatic ecosystems|journal=Aquatic Invasions|volume=2|issue=2|pages=121–131|doi=10.3391/ai.2007.2.2.7|issn=1818-5487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, California and New Zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gard.no/web/updates/content/24305557/biofouling-moves-up-the-regulatory-agenda.|title=Biofouling moves up the regulatory agenda - GARD|website=www.gard.no|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main vector for the transport of non-native aquatic species is ballast water. [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|Ballast water]] taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Invasive species#cite%20note-MolnarGamboa2008-43|[47]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Xu|first=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|date=2014-08-24|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data: data mining for social good|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623330.2623364|publisher=ACM|pages=1699–1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364|isbn=9781450329569}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that 10,000 different species, many of which are non-indigenous, are transported via ballast water each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Streftaris|first=N|last2=Zenetos|first2=Argyro|last3=Papathanassiou|first3=Enangelos|date=2005|title=Globalisation in marine ecosystems: The story of non-indigenous marine species across European seas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253862066|journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology|volume=43|pages=419–453|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively impact their new environment. For example, freshwater [[zebra mussel]]s, native to the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Sea of Azov|Azov seas]], most likely reached the [[Great Lakes]] via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms for oxygen and food, such as algae. Although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988, and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter, the plan had a serious flaw or loophole, whereby ships loaded with cargo when they reached the [[St. Lawrence Seaway|Seaway]] were not tested because their ballast water tanks were empty. However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port (when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/98880204.html/|title=Noxious cargo|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current regulations for the Great Lakes rely on ‘salinity shock’ to kill freshwater organisms left in ballast tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/GLC-BW-Reg-Summary-11.14.16.pdf|title=Status of Ballast Water Discharge Regulations in the Great Lakes Region|last=Great Lake Commission|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10-50 micron size class. For organisms between 10 and 50 microns, such as certain types of phytoplankton, current regulations allow less than 10 cells per milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/5ps/NVIC/2018/NVIC-01_18.pdf|title=Ballast Water Management for Control of Non-Indigenous Species in Waters of the United States|last=USCG|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discharge gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so the discharged water is not necessarily the same as the receiving body of water. Since many species of phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce asexually, only one cell released into the environment could exponentially grow into many thousands of cells over a short amount of time. This loophole could have detrimental effects to the environment. For example, some species in the genus ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic acid, a neurotoxin. If toxic ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' spp. are alive in ballast discharge and get released into their “new environment” they could cause domoic acid poisoning in shellfish, marine mammals and birds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trainer|first=Vera L.|last2=Bates|first2=Stephen S.|last3=Lundholm|first3=Nina|last4=Thessen|first4=Anne E.|last5=Cochlan|first5=William P.|last6=Adams|first6=Nicolaus G.|last7=Trick|first7=Charles G.|date=2012|title=Pseudo-nitzschia physiological ecology, phylogeny, toxicity, monitoring and impacts on ecosystem health|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=14|pages=271–300|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2011.10.025|issn=1568-9883|hdl=1912/5118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, human deaths related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in Canada in 1987.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future ramifications associated with the potential release of toxic and invasive phytoplankton.

Another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is the role of environmental changes associated with climate change, such as an increase in ocean temperature. There have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Occhipinti-Ambrogi|first=Anna|date=2007|title=Global change and marine communities: Alien species and climate change|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=55|issue=7–9|pages=342–352|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.014|pmid=17239404|issn=0025-326X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahel|first=Frank J.|last2=Olden|first2=Julian D.|date=2008|title=Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have detrimental effects on the environment as new species interactions emerge. For example, Hua and Hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from the temperature zone through tropical waters can experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=J.|last2=Hwang|first2=W.H.|date=2012|title=Effects of voyage routing on the survival of microbes in ballast water|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=42|pages=165–175|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.01.013|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further examine the effects of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water, Lenz et al. (2018) carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress experiment. Their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Mark|last2=Ahmed|first2=Yasser|last3=Canning-Clode|first3=João|last4=Díaz|first4=Eliecer|last5=Eichhorn|first5=Sandra|last6=Fabritzek|first6=Armin G.|last7=da Gama|first7=Bernardo A.

Since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of “hijackers” on ships’ hulls or in ballast water, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around the world.

===Impacts of wildfire and firefighting===
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ([[wildfire]]s, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while adding a variety of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"/&gt;  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"/&gt;

Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Effects==
[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]

===Ecological===
Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in Hawaii (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.

Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the East Coast of the United States a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088–1091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].

Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |author2=D.

===Geomorphological===
Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection. For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the southeastern USA in the early 20th century to control soil erosion.  While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation, bioerosion, and bioconstruction.  For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab [[Eriocheir sinensis]] have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fei |first= S. |author2=J.

Shouse|year=2015 |title=Biogeomorphic Impacts of Invasive Species |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=45 |pages=69–87 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-120213-091928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Some invaders cause negative benefits towards the economy of the local area. For example, in the Great Lakes Region the [[sea lamprey]] is an invasive species that acts as a predator. In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a parasite without killing the host organism. However, in the Great Lakes Region, this co-evolutionary link is non existent, so the sea lamprey acts as a predator, and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12-18  month feeding period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glfc.org/sea-lamprey.php|title=Great Lakes Fishery Commission - Sea Lamprey|website=www.glfc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon. The sea lampreys' destructive effects towards large fish negatively affects the fishing industry and has helped collapse the population of some economy dependent species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Economic opportunities====
Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits.

=====Benefits=====
Although most people focus on the negative effects of invasive and non-native species, they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases. Ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non-native species in order to succeed. There are four major ways that non-natives can be very beneficial for an ecosystem. The first is that they can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. A good example of this is the Tamarisk, a non-native woody plant, and the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatcher were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had nested in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored. The second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species. Many non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the Aldabra giant tortoises, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services. There are many examples of this. The major one being pollinators. The American Honey bee was introduced in the rainforest to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive species. Such as the use of non-native species to control agricultural pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHLAEPFER|first=MARTIN A.|last2=SAX|first2=DOV F.|last3=OLDEN|first3=JULIAN D.|date=2011-02-22|title=The Potential Conservation Value of Non-Native Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=428–437|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01646.x|pmid=21342267|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-native species can have other benefits. [[Chesapeake Bay#Depletion of oysters|Asian oysters]], for example, filter water pollutants better than native{{clarify|reason=native to where?|date=September 2012}} oysters. They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently considering releasing this [[mollusk]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's deteriorating water quality.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pelton, ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- does the asian threaten the local?--&gt; Additionally, some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment, a term referred to as [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]]. For example, ''[[Lasioglossum leucozonium|L. leucozonium]]'', shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Successful Biological Invasion despite a Severe Genetic Load|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2007-09-12|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 1964518|pmid = 17848999|volume = 2|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000868|first = Amro|last = Zayed|first2 = Şerban A.|last2 = Constantin|first3 = Laurence|last3 = Packer|pages=e868}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become an important pollinator of [[Rubus|caneberry]] as well as [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]], [[apple trees]], and blueberry bushes.&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee.

=====Invasivorism=====
''See also [[:Category:Edible invasive species]]''

Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system. In response, Invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control, reduce, or eliminate their populations. Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients. [[Miya's]] of [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] created the first invasive species menu in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invasive-species-menu-of-a-world-class-chef/|title=Invasive Species Menu of a World-Class Chef|journal=Scientific American|volume=309|issue=3|pages=40–43|date=September 1, 2013|author= Bun Lai |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0913-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place—such as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico—eradication is almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2015/feb/06/cooking-cant-solve-the-invasive-threat|title=Cooking can't solve the threat of invasive species|author=Emma Bryce|date=6 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida]]
Proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction—such as the [[Dodo]] bird, the [[Caribbean monk seal]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. Proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of [[lionfish]] by encouraging the consumption of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/invasive-lionfish-kings-caribbean-may-met-match-011600208.html|title=Invasive Lionfish, the Kings of the Caribbean, May Have Met Their Match|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costs====
Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $138&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="pimental"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimentel |first= D. |last2= R. |first2= Zuniga  |last3= Morrison |first3= D |year= 2005 |title=Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=52 |issue= 3|pages=273–288 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues.&lt;ref name="simb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Biological invasions - How are they affecting us, and what can we do about them? |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume= 61 |pages=308–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of [[ecosystem services]], costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions.

It is often argued that the key to reducing the costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2008–2012 National Invasive Species Management Plan.|last=|first=|publisher=National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC.|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it, while the population is small, is less expensive that managing the invasive population when it is widespread and already causing damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant industry====
Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients. Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see [[dynamic accumulator]]) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, ''[[Euphorbia esula]]'') or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., [[yellow starthistle]]). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by [[Western honeybee|honey bees]] infected by the invasive [[varroa mite]]. Introduced rats (''[[Rattus rattus]]'' and ''[[Rattus norvegicus|R. norvegicus]]'') have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock.  Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP).  Because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found.&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Citrus Greening."

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aquaculture====
[[Aquaculture]] is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential (e.g., ''[[Oreochromis niloticus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azevedo-Santos|first= V.M. |author2=O.

====Forestry====

[[File:Firewoodposter white web.pdf|thumb|right|Poster asking campers to not move firewood around, avoiding the spread of invasive species.]]
The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change [[forest ecology]] and damage the timber industry.

The Asian long-horned beetle (''[[Anoplophora glabripennis]]'') was first introduced into the U.S. in 1996, and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees.

====Tourism and recreation====
Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including, but not limited to, water quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eiswerth |first=M.E. |year=2005 |title=Input-output modeling, outdoor recreation, and the economic impacts of weeds |journal=Weed Science |volume=53 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1614/WS-04-022R |last2=Darden |first2=Tim D. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wayne S. |last4=Agapoff |first4=Jeanmarie |last5=Harris |first5=Thomas R.|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1614/WS-04-022R |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiswerth states, "very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions, states, and watersheds".

===Health===
Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and [[tsetse fly]] pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of [[Paragonimus westermani|Asian lung fluke]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aquatic invasive species.

For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}

Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global [[biodiversity loss]] and is increasing because of tourism and [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated [[fresh water]] systems, though [[quarantine]]s and [[ballast water]] rules have improved the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] exclusion, [[Ecological niche|niche]] displacement, or [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world's fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odendaal | first1 = L.

Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence (either ecological or economic), in relation to the potential risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of diversity and discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing; 1st Unabridged edition|date=March 1, 2013|isbn=978-1443844536|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression. Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations. For example, ''Spartina alterniflora'' was introduced in the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native ''Spartina foliosa.'' The higher pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in [[introgression]] that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of the native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12469817|title=Anttila CK, King RA, Ferris C, Ayres DR, Strong DR.

== Invasive exotic diseases ==
History is rife with the spread of exotic diseases, such as the introduction of [[smallpox]] into the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the Spanish, where it obliterated entire [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|populations of indigenous civilizations]] before they were ever even seen by Europeans.

Problematic exotic disease introductions in the past century or so include the [[chestnut blight]] which has almost eliminated the [[American chestnut]] tree from its forest habitat.  Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.

Another example is the [[Dutch elm disease]], which has severely reduced the [[American elm]] trees in forests and cities.

Diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as the [[Diaphorina citri|Asian citrus psyllid]] and the bacterial disease [[Citrus greening disease|citrus greening]].&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Pest Alert: Citrus Greening." Clemson University Invasive Species Program. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/Pest%20Alerts/citrus_greening.html. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in recent years some argue that some introduced species may have a positive ecological impact on an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110211095555.htm|title=Invasive plants can create positive ecological change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of [[ecology]] and [[geography]] where the issue of biological invasions is especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] 1958 book ''The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants'' which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|author2=Martha F. Hoopes |author3=Michael P. Marchetti |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182–96|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with [[terrestrial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally "Invasion biology".&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another.&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;

In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on [[biogeography]] rather than on [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colautti| first=Robert I. |author2=Hugh J. MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal=Diversity and Distributions| year=2004 |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf| volume=10 |pages=135–141 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.

=== Introduced species on islands ===
Perhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].

An additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.

The field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species.

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main|Invasive species in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]] the largest commercial crop is ''[[Pinus radiata]]'', the [[California native plants|native Californian]] Monterey pine tree, which grows as well in New Zealand as in [[California]]. However, the pine forests are also occupied by [[deer]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. They are exotic species and have thrived in the New Zealand environment. The pines are seen as beneficial while the deer are regarded as serious pests.

Common [[gorse]], originally a hedge plant in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], was introduced to New Zealand for the same purpose. Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant that threatens to obliterate native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish themselves.

[[Rabbit]]s, introduced as a food source by sailors in the 1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South Island. The [[myxomatosis]] [[virus]] was illegally imported and illegally released, but it had little lasting effect upon the rabbit population other than to make it more resistant to the virus.

Cats, brought later by Europeans, have had a devastating effect upon the native birdlife, particularly as many New Zealand birds are flightless. Feral cats and dogs which were originally brought as pets are also known to kill large numbers of birds. A recent (2006) study in the South Island has shown that even domestic cats with a ready supply of food from their owners may kill hundreds of birds in a year, including natives.

[[Sparrows]], which were brought to control insects upon the introduced [[grain]] crops, have displaced native birds as have [[rainbow lorikeet]]s and [[cockatoos]] (both from Australia) which fly free around areas west of [[Auckland]] City such as the [[Waitakere Ranges]].

In much of New Zealand, the Australian [[black swan]] has effectively eliminated the existence of the previously introduced [[mute swan]].

Two notable varieties of spiders have also been introduced: the [[white tail spider]] and the [[redback spider]]. Both may have arrived inside shipments of fruit. Until then,  the only spider (and the only venomous animal) dangerous to humans was the native [[katipo]], which is very similar to the redback and  interbreed with the more aggressive Australian variety.

==== South Georgia Island ====

In 2018, the [[South Georgia Island]] was declared free of invasive [[rodent]]s after a multi-year extermination effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/rat-begone-record-eradication-effort-rids-sub-antarctic-island-invasive-rodents|title=Rat begone: Record eradication effort rids sub-Antarctic island of invasive rodents|last=Warren|first=Matt|date=2018-05-08|work=Science|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-exterminate-rats-on-an-island&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mind over matter''' is a phrase that has been used in several contexts, such as mind-centric [[spirituality|spiritual]] doctrines, parapsychology, and [[philosophy]].

==Origin==
The phrase "mind over matter" first appeared in 1863 in ''The Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of Man'' by [[Sir Charles Lyell]] (1797–1875) and was first used to refer to the increasing status and evolutionary growth of the minds of animals and man throughout Earth history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=John|last2=Kaplan|first2=Justin|title=Bartlett's Familiar Quotations: A Collection of Passages, Phrases, and Proverbs Traced to Their Sources in Ancient and Modern Literature|date=2002|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=9780316084604|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2015}} {{Quote|It may be said that, so far from having a materialistic tendency, the supposed introduction into the earth at successive geological periods of life &amp;mdash; sensation, instinct, the intelligence of the higher mammalia bordering on reason, and lastly, the improvable reason of Man himself &amp;mdash; presents us with a picture of the ever-increasing dominion of mind over matter.| Sir Charles Lyell, 1863}}

Another related saying, "'''the mind drives the mass'''," was coined almost two millennia earlier in 19 B.C. by the poet [[Virgil]] in his work ''[[Aeneid]]'', book 6, line 727.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Burton|title=The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases|date=1987|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0026145006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2015}}

==Parapsychology==
In the field of [[parapsychology]], the phrase has been used to describe [[paranormal]] phenomena such as [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Arthur S.|last2=Berger|first2=Joyce|title=The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research|date=1991|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|isbn=1557780439|page=341|edition=1st|quote=Psychokinesis (PK). The response of objects such as dice or the environment to a person's wishes is commonly labelled 'mind over matter'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilovich|first1=Thomas|title=How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life|date=1993|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=9780029117064|pages=160–175|edition=1st|quote=A panel commissioned by the [[United States National Research Council]] to study paranormal claims concluded that "despite a 130-year record of scientific research on such matters, our committee could find no scientific justification for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or ‘mind over matter’ exercises... Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mao Zedong==
"Mind over matter" was also [[Mao Zedong]]'s idea that rural peasants could be "proletarianized" so they could lead the [[Chinese Civil War|revolution]] and China could move from [[feudalism]] to [[socialism]] through [[New Democracy]]. According to some, it departs from Leninism in that the revolutionaries are peasants, instead of the urban proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum|first1=Richard D.|title="Red and Expert": The Politico-Ideological Foundations of China's Great Leap Forward|journal=Asian Survey|date=1 January 1964|volume=4|issue=9|pages=1048–1057|doi=10.2307/2642397|jstor=2642397|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But others assert that this is a lazy analysis because Mao never disputed the fact that the proletariat should lead, he simply adapted Marxism to the conditions of China.

==Controlling pain==
The phrase also relates to the ability to control the perception of pain that one may or may not be experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiech|first1=Katja|last2=Ploner|first2=Markus|last3=Tracey|first3=Irene|title=Neurocognitive aspects of pain perception|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 August 2008|volume=12|issue=8|pages=306–313|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.05.005|pmid=18606561|accessdate=|issn=1364-6613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morality''' (from {{Lang-la|moralis|lit=manner, character, proper behavior}}) is the differentiation of [[intention]]s, decisions and [[Social actions|actions]] between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Translations of the Principal Sources with Philosophical Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfemGeG8SysC&amp;dq|volume=1|first1=A.

Moral philosophy includes moral [[ontology]], which is the origin of morals; and [[moral epistemology]], which studies the knowledge of morals. Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including [[Deontological ethics|deontological ethical]] systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and [[Normative ethics|normative]] ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the [[Golden Rule]], which states that: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself."&lt;ref name = "Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy | publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn = 9780333262047|quote=The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'.

He posits that it "express[es] the essence of a universal morality." The rationale for this distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). {{cite book | last = Stace | first = Walter T. | title = The Concept of Morals | publisher = The MacMillan Company; reprinted by Peter Smith Publisher Inc, January 1990 | date = 1937 | location = New York | page = 136 | isbn = 0-8446-2990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immorality]] is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is [[good]] or right), while [[amorality]] is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.&lt;ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Ethics&lt;!--'Morality and ethics' redirects here--&gt;===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] introduced the [[categorical imperative]]: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law".]]
{{Main|Ethics}}
{{see also|Sittlichkeit}}

Ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of [[philosophy]] which addresses questions of morality. The word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially [[deontological ethics]], sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: "Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of [[Immanuel Kant]], based on notions such as duty, obligation, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] of conduct, reserving ethics for the more [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a [[virtue]], and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Simon Blackburn|last = Blackburn|first = Simon |title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|edition = 2nd|date = 2008|page = 240|isbn = 978-0199541430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive and normative===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
In its descriptive sense, "morality" refers to [[Value (personal and cultural)|personal or cultural values]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] or social [[mores]] from a society that provides these codes of conduct in which it applies and is accepted by an individual. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong. [[Descriptive ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.&lt;ref name="Gert"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/morality-definition/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gert|first=Bernard|last2=Gert|first2=Joshua|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its [[normative]] sense, "morality" refers to whatever (if anything) is ''actually'' right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. [[Normative ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.&lt;ref name="Gert"/&gt;

===Realism and anti-realism===
Philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of [[meta-ethics]]) are broadly divided into two classes:
* [[Moral realism]] is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape individuals' "moral" decisions, they deny that those cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[convention (norm)|customs]] define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]], however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. [[ethical non-naturalism|ethical non-naturalists]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Chapouthier|Chapouthier, Georges]], "To what extent is moral judgment natural?", ''European Review'' (GB), 2004, 12(2): 179–83&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral [[anti-realism]], on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts ([[error theory]]); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts ([[ethical subjectivism]]); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command ([[non-cognitivism]]).

Some forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism, while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with [[moral universalism]]. For example, [[universal prescriptivism]] is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and [[divine command theory]] and [[ideal observer theory]] are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.

==Anthropology==

===Tribal and territorial===
[[Celia Green]] made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Celia (2004). ''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Chapters I–XX.&lt;/ref&gt; She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s '[[categorical imperative]]' and [[Norman Geisler|Geisler]]'s [[graded absolutism]]. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.

===In-group and out-group===
{{main|Ingroups and outgroups}}
Some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an "[[in-group]]" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an "out-group" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. Shultz, M. Hartshorn, and A. Kaznatcheev. [http://141.14.165.6/CogSci09/papers/500/ Why is ethnocentrism more common than humanitarianism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327152454/http://141.14.165.6/CogSci09/papers/500/ |date=2012-03-27 }} Proceedings of the 31st annual conference of the cognitive science society, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in-group and irrational hostility towards the out-group.&lt;ref&gt;Kaznatcheev, A.

In ''Complex Adaptive Systems – AAAI Fall Symposium''.Butiz wintrades&lt;/ref&gt; Gary R. Johnson and V.S. Falger have argued that [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] are forms of this in-group/out-group boundary. Jonathan Haidt has noted&lt;ref name = haidt&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z | pmid = | title = When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize | year = 2007 | last1 = Haidt | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Graham | first2 = Jesse | journal = Social Justice Research | volume = 20 | pages = 98–116 |url = http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.graham.2007.when-morality-opposes-justice.pub041.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that experimental observation indicating an in-group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by [[conservative]]s, but far less so by [[Liberalism|liberals]].

===Comparing cultures===
Peterson and Seligman&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher, and Martin E. P. Seligman. ''Character Strengths and Virtues''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include ''wisdom / knowledge; courage; [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]; justice; temperance; and transcendence''. Each of these includes several divisions. For instance ''humanity'' includes ''[[love]]'', ''[[kindness]]'', and ''social intelligence''.

[[Fons Trompenaars]], author of ''Did the Pedestrian Die?'', tested members of different cultures with various [[moral dilemma]]s. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAYKAQAAMAAJ|title=Did the Pedestrian Die: Insights from the World's Greatest Culture Guru|last=Trompenaars|first=Fons|date=2003-03-14|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781841124360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century'', "One of the important objectives of this book is to blend harmoniously the fine souls regarding conduct in the Eastern and the Western cultures, to take the result as the source and then to create newer and better conduct principles to suit the human society of the new century, and to introduce a lot of Chinese fine conduct spirits to the Western world. It is hoped that this helps solve lots of problems the human society of the 21st century faces, including (but not limited to the Eastern and the Western cultures) what a single culture cannot."

==Evolution==
{{See also|Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}

The development of modern morality is a process closely tied to [[sociocultural evolution]]. Some [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], particularly [[Sociobiology|sociobiologists]], believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through [[group selection]] (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved "pro-social" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.

On this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically-driven behaviors which encourage human [[cooperation]]. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate [[selfishness]] in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]). Examples: the [[maternal bond]] is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the [[Westermarck effect]], where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins [[Incest taboo|taboos against incest]] because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as [[inbreeding]].

&lt;!-- kinship altruism theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- handicap altruism theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- reputation theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- reciprocity theory --&gt;
The phenomenon of [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some [[vampire bat]]s fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)

Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as "a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups." This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, Marc and Jessica Pierce ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals'' (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show [[empathy]] for each other in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connell |first= Sanjida |date=July 1995|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397–410|issn= 0032-8332 |url=  |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals|last = de Waal|first = Frans|date = 1997|publisher = Harvard University Press |isbn = 978-0674356610}}&lt;/ref&gt; prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation]] management.

Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular the development of [[theory of mind]] abilities.

==Moral cognition==

Moral cognition refers to cognitive processes that allow a person to act or decide in morally permissible ways. It consists of several domain-general cognitive processes, ranging from perception of a morally-salient stimuli to reasoning when faced with a moral dilemma. While it’s important to mention that there is not a single cognitive faculty dedicated exclusively to moral cognition, characterizing the contributions of domain-general processes to moral behavior is a critical scientific endeavor to understand how morality works and how it can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Liane |last2=Dungan |first2=James |title=Where in the brain is morality? Everywhere and maybe nowhere |journal=Social Neuroscience |date=January 2012 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/17470919.2011.569146|pmid=21590587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists investigate the inputs to these cognitive processes and their interactions, as well as how these contribute to moral behavior by running controlled experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yoder |first1=Keith J. |last2=Decety |first2=Jean |title=The neuroscience of morality and social decision-making |journal=Psychology, Crime &amp; Law |date=12 December 2017 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=279–295 |doi=10.1080/1068316X.2017.1414817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments putatively moral versus nonmoral stimuli are compared to each other, while controlling for other variables such as content or working memory load. Often, the differential neural response to specifically moral statements or scenes, are examined using functional neuroimaging experiments.

Critically, the specific cognitive processes that are involved depend on the prototypical situation that a person encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monin |first1=Benoît |last2=Pizarro |first2=David A. |last3=Beer |first3=Jennifer S. |title=Deciding versus reacting: Conceptions of moral judgment and the reason-affect debate. |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=2007 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=99–111 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, while situations that require an active decision on a moral dilemma may require active reasoning, an immediate reaction to a shocking moral violation may involve quick, affect-laden processes. Nonetheless certain cognitive skills such as being able to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions to oneself, and to others is a common feature of a broad range of prototypical situations. In line with this, a meta-analysis found overlapping activity between moral emotion and moral reasoning tasks, suggesting a shared neural network for both tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Spreng |first2=R. Nathan |title=Contextual and Perceptual Brain Processes Underlying Moral Cognition: A Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Moral Reasoning and Moral Emotions |journal=PLoS ONE |date=4 February 2014 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=e87427 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0087427|pmid=24503959 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...987427S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this meta-analaysis, however, also demonstrated that the processing of moral input is affected by task demands.

==Neuroscience==
{{anchor|Neuroscience of morality}}
{{see also|Science of morality}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by a quantitative large-scale meta-analysis of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature.,&lt;ref name = Bzdok&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ |title=Bzdok, D. et al.

This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons' points of view and to grasping others' feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.&lt;ref name = Bzdok /&gt;

===Brain areas===

An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R.

The explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (VMPC) while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the [[temporoparietal junction]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harenski | first1 = CL | last2 = Antonenko | first2 = O | last3 = Shane | first3 = MS | last4 = Kiehl | first4 = KA.  | year = 2010 | title = A functional imaging investigation of moral deliberation and moral intuition | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 2707–16 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.062 | pmid = 19878727 | pmc = 4270295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stimulation of the VMPC by [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral
judgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why
were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other
morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Camprodon |first2= Joan Albert |last3= Hauser |first3= Marc |last4= Pascual-Leone |first4= Alvaro |last5= Saxe |first5= Rebecca |year= 2010 |title= Disruption of the right temporoparietal junction with transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces the role of beliefs in moral judgments |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume= 107 |issue= 15 |pages= 6753–58 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0914826107 |pmid=20351278 |pmc=2872442|bibcode= 2010PNAS..107.6753Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirror neurons===
{{main|Mirror neurons}}
Mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action. The neurons fire in imitation of the action being observed, causing the same muscles to act minutely in the observer as are acting grossly in the person actually performing the action.

[[File:Kohlberg Model of Moral Development.svg|thumb|[[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] Model of Moral Development]]

In modern [[moral psychology]], morality is considered to change through personal development. A number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Elliot Turiel]] have cognitive-developmental approaches to [[moral development]]; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. In the [[Ethics of care]] approach established by [[Carol Gilligan]], moral development occurs in the context of caring, mutually responsive relationships  which are based on [[interdependence]], particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan and Kohlberg: "Implications for Moral Theory" Author(s): Lawrence A. Blum
Source: ''Ethics'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Apr., 1988), pp. 472–91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology|Social psychologists]] such as [[Martin Hoffman]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as [[empathy]]. Moral identity theorists, such as [[William Damon]] and [[Mordechai Nisan]], see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of [[psychoanalyst]]s such as [[Sigmund Freud]], who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the [[super-ego]] as guilt-shame avoidance.

Because we are naturally prone to be empathic and moral, we have a sense of responsibility to pursue moral purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Decety | first = Jean | year = 2008 | title = Study shows Children are naturally prone to be empathic and moral | url = http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/07/11/children-are-naturally-prone-be-empathic-and-moral-university-chicago-study-shows | journal = University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the Pain?

Such behaviors jeopardize our moral self-image; however, when we engage in immoral behaviors we still feel as though we are moral individuals. ''[[Moral self-licensing]]'' attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behavior. When our moral self-image is threatened, we can gain confidence from our past moral behavior. The more confident we are, the less we will worry about our future behavior which actually increases the likelihood that we will engage in immoral behaviors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Monin | first1 = B | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.

As an alternative to viewing morality as an individual trait, some sociologists as well as social- and discursive psychologists have taken upon themselves to study the ''in-vivo'' aspects of morality by examining how persons conduct themselves in social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergmann Jörg |  year = 1998 | title = Introduction:Morality in discourse | url = | journal = Research on Language and Social Interaction | volume = 31 | issue = 3/4| pages = 279–74 | doi = 10.1080/08351813.1998.9683594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Bergmann "Veiled morality: Notes on discretion in psychiatry."

==Politics==
If morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level, [[politics]] can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level, though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;See Weber, Eric Thomas. 2011. ''[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/morality-leadership-and-public-policy-9781441144812/ Morality, Leadership, and Public Policy]'' (London: Continuum).&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics. [[Jonathan Haidt]] and [[Jesse Graham]] have studied the differences between [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]], in this regard.&lt;ref name=haidt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/haidt |title=Morality: 2012: Online Only Video |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousintersection.org/?p=1445 |title=Why conservatives and liberals talk past each other on moral issues. |publisher=Dangerous Intersection |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt found that Americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty, respect and purity. Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogenous communities, in contrast to [[port]]-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.

Group morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess "moral fiber", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of [[Cistercian]] reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Dowager Empress]] in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.
Political Morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population. [[Noam Chomsky]] states that&lt;ref name="Zmag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11934 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113102044/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11934 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-13 |title=Terror and Just Response |publisher=ZNet |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=2002-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="counterpunch"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/schivone08032007.html &lt;!-- alternate: http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20070803.htm --&gt; |title=On Responsibility, War Guilt and Intellectuals |last=Schivone |first=Gabriel Matthew |date=2007-08-03 |journal=[[CounterPunch]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004204116/http://www.counterpunch.org/schivone08032007.html |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }} Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if we adopt the principle of universality : if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.

In fact, one of the, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something's right for me, it's right for you; if it's wrong for you, it's wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Ethics in religion|Morality and religion}} {{See also|Divine command theory|Divine law|Morality without religion|Religious law|Secular ethics}}

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is "an almost automatic assumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-078-03824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positions ===
Within the wide range of moral traditions, religious value systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious value systems. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Other religions spanning [[pantheistic]] to [[nontheistic]] tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages= 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by [[Barbara Stoler Miller]], who states that, in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and [[egalitarianism]], this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last=  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 0-553-21365-2 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In monotheistic traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]].{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Religion is not always positively associated with morality. Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious [[piety]] and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion."

Religious value systems can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's [[New Testament]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|E|e|none}} Christian [[apologists]] address Blackburn's viewpoints&lt;ref name="colley1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colley|first=Caleb|title=Is Christianity a Threat to Ethics?|url=http://espanol.apologeticspress.org/articles/240427|publisher=Apologetics Press|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construe that [[Halachah|Jewish laws]] in the [[Jewish Bible]] showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="enrichmentjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery?

These values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;See Weber, Eric Thomas.

=== Empirical analyses ===
A number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and [[crime]] is unclear.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} A 2001 review of studies on this topic found "The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime."&lt;ref name = baier/&gt; Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, ''Society without God'', based on studies conducted during a 14-month period in Scandinavia in 2005-2006, notes that [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], "which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world", enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us about Contentment|edition= |last= Zuckerman|first= Phil|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-8147-9714-3|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by [[Gregory S. Paul]] published in the ''Journal of Religion and Society'' stated that, "In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies," and "In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and "theistic" Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html |journal=Journal of Religion and Society|title=Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies: A First Look|first=Gregory S.|last=Paul|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year =2005 |volume =7|pages=4–5, 8, 10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214113448/http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html |archivedate=2011-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|d|none}}  In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;Gary F.

On April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments were published in the ''[[Social Psychological and Personality Science]]'' journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm "Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers"].

==Cognitive strategy==
The processes of motivated reasoning are a type of inferred justification strategy which is used to mitigate [[cognitive dissonance]]. When people form and cling to false beliefs despite overwhelming evidence, the  phenomenon is labeled "motivated reasoning".  In other words, "rather than search rationally for information that either confirms or disconfirms a particular belief, people actually seek out information that confirms what they already believe".&lt;ref&gt;Begley, Sharon. [http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/24/lies-of-mass-destruction.html  "Lies of Mass Destruction,"] ''Newsweek'' (US). August 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is "a form of implicit emotion regulation in which the brain converges on judgments that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states associated with threat to or attainment of motives".&lt;ref name="westen"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==

Early research on the evaluation and integration of information supported a cognitive approach consistent with [[Bayesian probability]], in which individuals weighted new information using rational calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Annual Review of Political Science |title=Misperceptions about Perceptual Bias |year=1999 |last1=Gerber |first1=Alan |last2=Green |first2=Donald  |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=189–2100 |issn=1094-2939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To further complicate the issue, the first neuro-imaging study designed to test the neural circuitry of individuals engaged in motivated reasoning found that motivated reasoning "was not associated with neural activity in regions previously linked with cold reasoning tasks [Bayesian reasoning] and conscious (explicit) emotion regulation".&lt;ref name="westen"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Westen | first1 = D. | last2 = Blagov | first2 = P.

This section focuses on two theories that elucidate the mechanisms involved in motivated reasoning. Both theories distinguish between mechanisms present when the individual is trying to reach an accurate conclusion, and those present when the individual has a directional goal.

=== Goal-oriented motivated reasoning ===

One review of the research develops the following theoretical model to explain the mechanism by which motivated reasoning results in bias.&lt;ref&gt;Ziva Kunda 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The model is summarized as follows:

Motivation to arrive at a desired conclusion provides a level of arousal, which acts as an initial trigger for the operation of cognitive processes. Historically, motivated reasoning theory identifies that directional goals enhance the accessibility of knowledge structures (memories, information, knowledge) that are consistent with desired conclusions. This theory endorses previous research on accessing information, but adds a procedural component in specifying that the motivation to achieve directional goals will also influence which rules (procedural structures such as inferential rules) and which beliefs are accessed to guide the search for information. In this model the beliefs and rule structures are instrumental in directing which information will be obtained to support the desired conclusion.

In comparison, Milton Lodge and Charles Taber (2000) introduce an empirically supported model in which affect is intricately tied to cognition, and information processing is biased toward support for positions that the individual already holds.

This model has three components:

# On-line processing in which when called on to make an evaluation, people instantly draw on stored information which is marked with affect;
# Affect is automatically activated along with the cognitive node to which it is tied;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fazio |first= Russell |editors= Richard E. Petty, Jon A. Krosnick |title= Attitude Strength: Antecedents and Consequences |publisher= [[Mahwah, NJ]] |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-8058-1086-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A "[[heuristic]] mechanism" for evaluating new information triggers a reflection on "How do I feel?" about this topic. The result of this process results in a bias towards maintaining existing affect, even in the face of other, disconfirming information.

This theory of motivated reasoning is fully developed and tested in Lodge and Taber's ''The Rationalizing Voter'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rationalizing Voter|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|author=Milton Lodge|author2=Charles Taber}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Redlawsk (2002) found that the timing of when disconfirming information was introduced played a role in determining bias. When subjects encountered incongruity during an information search, the automatic assimilation and update process was interrupted. This results in one of two outcomes: subjects may enhance attitude strength in a desire to support existing affect (resulting in degradation in decision quality and potential bias) or, subjects may counter-argue existing beliefs in an attempt to integrate the new data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second outcome is consistent with the research on how processing occurs when one is tasked with accuracy goals.

=== Accuracy-oriented motivated reasoning ===

Kunda asserts that accuracy goals delay the process of coming to a premature conclusion, in that accuracy goals increase both the quantity and quality of processing—particularly in leading to more complex inferential cognitive processing procedures.
When researchers manipulated test subjects motivation to be accurate by informing them that the target task was highly important or that they would be expected to defend their judgments, it was found that subjects utilized deeper processing, and that there was less biasing of information. This was true when accuracy motives were present at the initial processing and encoding of information. Tetlock (1983, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accountability and the perseverance of first impressions |year=1983 |last1=Tetlock |first1=P |journal=Social Psychology Quarterly |volume= 46  |issue=4 |pages=285–292 |issn=0190-2725 |doi=10.2307/3033716|jstor=3033716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accountability: A social check on the fundamental attribution error |year=1985 |last1=Tetlock |first1=P |journal=Social Psychology Quarterly |volume=48  |issue=3 |pages=227–236 |issn=0190-2725 |doi=10.2307/3033683|jstor=3033683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In reviewing a line of research on accuracy goals and bias, Kunda concludes, "several different kinds of biases have been shown to weaken in the presence of accuracy goals".&lt;ref&gt;Kunda (1990) p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; She asserts that for accuracy to reduce bias the following conditions must be present. 
#Subjects must possess appropriate reasoning strategies
#They must view these as superior to other strategies,
#And be capable of using them at will.

These last two conditions introduce the construct that accuracy goals include a conscious process of utilizing [[cognitive strategy|cognitive strategies]] in motivated reasoning. This construct is called into question by later neuroscience research that concludes that motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning (in instances when there is no strong emotional stake in the outcomes), (Weston, 2006 ).&lt;ref name="westen"/&gt;

In summary, both models differentiate between accuracy goals, and goal directed processing. They differ in that Redlawsk identifies a primary role for affect in guiding cognitive processes and in maintaining bias. In contrast, Kunda identifies a primary role for cognitive processes such as memory processes, and the use of rules in determining biased information selection. At least one study in neuroscience does not support the use of cognitive processes in motivated reasoning, lending greater support to affective processing as a key mechanism in supporting bias. 
Of interest, neuroscience is consistent with Freud's (1933)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Freud |first= Sigmund  |title= New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis |publisher= [[Hogarth Press]] |year= 1933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theory of "defensive processing" which occurred in the unconscious, and was seen as a mechanism to avoid feelings of anxiety and guilt.

==Research==
Neuroscientific research suggest that "motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached."&lt;ref name="westen"/&gt;

Social science research suggests that reasoning away contradictions is psychologically easier than revising feelings. In this sense, emotions are shown to color how "facts" are perceived. Feelings come first, and evidence is used mostly in service of those feelings. Evidence that supports what is already believed is accepted, that which contradicts it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Redlawsk |first=David P. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/a-matter-of-motivated-reasoning |title=A Matter of Motivated 'Reasoning' |work=New York Times |date=April 22, 2011}} citing {{Cite journal | last1 = Redlawsk | first1 = D.

==Outcomes==
The outcomes of motivated reasoning derive from "a biased set of cognitive processes—that is, strategies for accessing, constructing, and evaluating beliefs. The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion."&lt;ref name="kunda"/&gt;

Research on motivated reasoning tested accuracy goals (i.e., reaching correct conclusions) and directional goals (i.e., reaching preferred conclusions).  Factors such as these affect perceptions; and results confirm that motivated reasoning affects decision-making and estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nir | first1 = L. | title = Motivated Reasoning and Public Opinion Perception | doi = 10.1093/poq/nfq076 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 504 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kriss Donald''' (2 July 1988 – 15 March 2004) was a 15-year-old [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[White people|white]] male who was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[murder]]ed in [[Glasgow]] in 2004 by a gang of men of [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] origin,&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt; some of whom fled to [[Pakistan]] after the crime.&lt;ref name="Times Of India"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-17/rest-of-world/27813647_1_sikh-leaders-sikh-political-party-sikh-federation|work=The Times Of India|title=Sikhs blame British policy of 'Asian' tag|date=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PaxtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22kidnapped+because+he+was+White+and+was+tortured+to+death+over+five+hours%22&amp;dq=%22kidnapped+because+he+was+White+and+was+tortured+to+death+over+five+hours%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qeWYTsreM9C98gOCgo3CBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The Middle East, abstracts and index – Library Information and Research Service], google.com; accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/11/10/stories/2006111006241400.htm|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|title=Life for Pakistani men for killing white teenager|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daanish Zahid, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid and Mohammed Faisal Mustaq were later found guilty of [[racially motivated crime|racially motivated murder]] and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Times Of India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/justice_for_kriss_donald_held_hostage_by_the_law_1_539905|location=Edinburgh, UK|work=The Scotsman|first=Dan|last=Mcdougall|title=Justice for Kriss Donald held hostage by the law|date=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case, which featured the first-ever conviction for racially motivated murder in Scotland, is cited in two newspaper articles as an example of the lack of attention the media and society give to white sufferers of [[Racism|racist]] attacks compared to that given to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alibhai Brown|first=Yasmin|title=When the victim is white, does anyone care?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-153368757/when-the-victim-is-white-does-anyone-care|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=26 October 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Denise|title=Skin colour is irrelevant |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Skin+colour+is+irrelevant.-a0153544141|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=The Journal|date=31 October 2006|location=Newcastle, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested the crime demonstrates how society has been forced to redefine racism so as to no longer exclude white victims.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"/&gt;

==Kidnapping and murder==
On 15 March 2004, Donald was abducted from Kenmure Street by five men associated with a local [[British Pakistani]] [[gang]] led by Imran Shahid. The kidnapping was ostensibly revenge for an attack on Shahid at a [[nightclub]] in Glasgow city centre the night before by a local white gang, and Donald was chosen as an example of a "white boy from the McCulloch Street area" despite having no involvement in the nightclub attack or in any gang activity.&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6125660.stm "Gangsters, murder and extradition"], BBC News; accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt;

Donald was taken on a 200-mile journey to [[Dundee]] and back while his kidnappers made phone calls looking for a house to take him to. Having no success at this, they returned to Glasgow and took him to the [[Clyde Walkway]], near [[Celtic Football Club]]'s training ground.&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/09/race.ukcrime Three jailed for life for race murder of schoolboy]. The Guardian 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There, they held his arms (ascertained due to an absence of defensive wounds) and stabbed him multiple times. He sustained internal injuries to three [[arteries]], one of his [[lungs]], his [[liver]] and a [[kidney]]. He was doused in [[petrol]] and  set on fire as he [[Exsanguination|bled to death]].&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061102124926/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5058624.html|archivedate=2 November 2006|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5058624.html |title=Kriss trial told boy was set on fire as he bled to death|newspaper=[[Evening Times]]|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the killing quickly became politicised because of the racial element. After the murder there were reportedly 'racial tensions' in the area sufficient to lead to police intervention.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"/&gt;

==Arrests and first trials==
Initially, two men were arrested in connection with the crime. One man, Daanish Zahid, was found guilty of Kriss Donald's murder on 18 November 2004 and is the first person to be convicted of racially motivated murder in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Calum Macdonald, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23640996.html "Two others convicted THE FIRST TRIAL"], ''The Herald'', 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special extradition and later trial==
Three suspects were arrested in Pakistan in July 2005 and [[extradited]] to the UK in October 2005, following the intervention of [[Mohammad Sarwar (politician)|Mohammed Sarwar]], the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]].&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;

The [[Pakistani police]] had to engage in a "long struggle" to capture two of the escapees. There is no [[extradition treaty]] between Pakistan and Britain, but the Pakistani authorities agreed to extradite the suspects.&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt; There were numerous diplomatic complications around the case, including apparent divergences between government activities and those of ambassadorial officials; government figures were at times alleged to be reluctant to pursue the case for diplomatic reasons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/ministers-block-extradition-of-kriss-donald-murder-suspects-1-540009 "Ministers block extradition of Kriss Donald murder suspects"], ''The Scotsman'', 23 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three extradited suspects, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq, all in their late twenties, arrived in Scotland on 5 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4310410.stm "Glasgow murder suspects fly to UK"], BBC News, 5 October 2005.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with Donald's murder the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4314050.stm "Murder suspects appear in court"], BBC News, 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Their trial opened on 2 October 2006 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5400138.stm "Schoolboy murder trial under way"], BBC News, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2006, the three men were found guilty of the racially motivated murder of Kriss Donald. All three had denied the charge, but a jury at the High Court in [[Edinburgh]] convicted them of abduction and murder.&lt;ref name="BBC News 1"/&gt;

== Controversies surrounding the case ==

===Lack of media coverage===
The [[BBC]] has been criticised by some viewers because the case featured on national news only three times and the first trial was later largely confined to [[regional]] Scottish bulletins including the verdict itself. Although admitting that the BBC had "got it wrong", the organisation's Head of Newsgathering, [[Fran Unsworth]], largely rejected the suggestion that Donald's race played a part in the lack of reportage, instead claiming it was mostly a product of "Scottish blindness". In preference to reporting the verdict the organisation found the time to report the opening of a new [[arts centre]] in [[Gateshead]] in its running order.&lt;ref name="Newswatch"&gt;{{cite episode |title=NewsWatch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/shared/player/vid100.stm?clippos=0&amp;clipurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news_web/video/9012da68002d768/bb/09012da68002d97c_16x9_bb!asx&amp;title=NewsWatch%202%20December%202005&amp;wintype=200&amp;rhs=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4490000/newsid_4499400/bb_wm_4499440.stm&amp;cs=news&amp;fsname=bb_wm_fs&amp;bw=bb |series=[[NewsWatch (TV series)|NewsWatch]] |serieslink= |credits=Presenter: [[Raymond Snoddy]], Interviewee: [[Fran Unsworth]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC 1]], [[BBC News Channel]] |location=London, England |airdate=11 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The BBC again faced criticisms for its failure to cover the second trial in its main bulletins, waiting until day 18 to mention the issue and [[Peter Horrocks]] of the BBC apologised for the organisation's further failings.&lt;ref name="Newswatch2"&gt;{{cite episode |title=NewsWatch (TV series) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/video/63000/bb/63300_16x9_bb.asx |series=NewsWatch |serieslink= |credits=Presenter: Raymond Snoddy, Interviewee: [[Peter Horrocks]] |network=BBC |station=BBC 1, BBC News Channel |location=London, England |airdate=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Fahy]], spokesman of race issues for the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]], noted that the media as a whole tended to under-report the racist murders of white people, stating "it was a fact that it was harder to get the media interested where murder victims were young white men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/22/ukcrime.race |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Racial murders: nearly half the victims are white |first=Antony |last=Barnett |date=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British National Party]] were accused by [[First Minister of Scotland|Scotland's First Minister]] and [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] [[Jack McConnell]] among others of seeking to exploit the case for political advantage, and an open letter signed by [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]], trades unionists, and community leaders, condemned the BNP's plans to stage a visit to [[Pollokshields]]. The group did hold a rally in the area, leading to accusations that it was fuelling racial tension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/46396 sundayherald.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204154218/http://www.sundayherald.com/46396 |date=4 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police response===
A March 2004 article in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper alleged a lack of response by authorities to concerns of rising racial tensions and that [[Strathclyde Police]] had felt pressured to abandon Operation Gather, an investigation into Asian gangs in the area, for fear of offending ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Dan McDougall, [http://www.scotsman.com/news/murder-hunt-police-drop-politically-incorrect-gang-crackdown-1-518252 "Murder hunt police drop ‘politically incorrect’ gang crackdown"], ''The Scotsman'', 19 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2005 interview with a Scottish newspaper, prominent Pakistani Glaswegian [[Bashir Maan]] claimed that "fear and intimidation" had allowed problems with Asian gangs in some parts of the city to go unchecked. The article also quoted a former senior Strathclyde police officer who criticised "a culture of [[political correctness]]" which had allowed gang crime to "grow unfettered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0105s02.htm |title="Row over policing Asian gangs" |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231743/http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0105s02.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} by Imaad Azim in ''the iWitness''&lt;/ref&gt;

A BBC report suggests that another reason for inaction was lack of evidence, as locals were more prepared to make complaints than to give evidence in court.&lt;ref name="BBC News 3" /&gt; Some commentators have argued the murder was somewhat mischaracterised in the media, as well as expressing a doubt that significant ethnic tensions exist in Pollokshields, suggesting that "gangland revenge" may have played a part.&lt;ref name="www_spiked_online_com1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2081/ |title=spiked-online.com |accessdate=24 June 2007 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
Glasgow band [[Glasvegas]] wrote the song "[[Flowers &amp; Football Tops|Flowers And Football Tops]]" having been inspired by the tragedy and the likely effect it would have on the victim's parents.

==Legacy==
The murder led some people to examine their views of racism and its victims. [[Mark Easton]] cited the racist murders of Donald and also [[Murder of Ross Parker|Ross Parker]] as demonstrating how society has been forced to redefine [[racism]] and discard the erroneous definition of "[[prejudice plus power]]"—a definition which only allowed ethnic minorities to be victims of hate crime.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6128466.stm |work=BBC News |first=Mark |last=Easton |title=Racism and race crime redefined |date=8 November 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] also cited the Donald case when highlighting the lack of concern for white victims of racist murders. She drew comparisons with high-profile ethnic minority victims, asking whether Donald's murderers were "less evil than those who killed [[Stephen Lawrence]]". Alibhai-Brown came to the conclusion that treating "some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable—and a betrayal of [[anti-racism]] itself".&lt;ref name="Evening Standard" /&gt;

The Sanskrit word '''Nishtha''' (निष्ठा), in [[Hindu philosophy]], refers to faith, steadiness, devotion and the culmination, and in [[Sanskrit grammar]], to the affixes of the Past Participles - ''kta'' and ''katavatu''. 

==Meaning==

'''Nishtha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: निष्ठ or निष्ठा) means – 'being in or on', 'situated on', 'depending or 'resting on', 'referring' or 'relating to', 'devoted or attached to', 'practicing', 'intent on', 'skilled in', 'believing in', 'conducive to', 'effecting', 'position', 'condition', 'state', 'basis', 'foundation', 'fixity', 'fixedness', 'steadiness', 'devotion', 'application', 'close attachment', 'belief', 'firm adherencev, 'faith', 'excellence', 'skill', 'proficiency', 'perfection', conclusion', 'end', 'termination', 'the catastrophe or end of a drama', 'accomplishment', 'completion', 'the culminating point', 'death', 'destruction', 'disappearance from the world at the fixed time', 'fixed or certain knowledge', 'certainty', 'begging', 'suffering', 'trouble', 'distress', 'anxiety', 'a technical term for past participial terminations', and is one of the many names of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit dictionary|url=http://sanskritdictionary.com/ni%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADha/18819/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Philosophical significance==

On the battle-field of [[Kurukshetra]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]:

: लोकेऽस्मिन् द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयाऽनघ |
: ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् ||

: "O sinless one! Two kinds of disciplines in this world were set forth by Me in times of yore – for the ''Samkhyas'' the discipline of knowledge (''Jnana-nishtha''), and for the ''yogins'', that of works (''Karma-nishtha''). "  – ([[Bhagavad Gita]] III.3)

In his commentary on this ''sloka'', [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] states – "तत्र का सा द्विविधा निष्ठा इति? आह - What is this two-fold discipline? Listen: (i) The discipline of knowledge (ज्ञानयोग),….(for) the renouncers of the ''Paramhamsa order'' who have established themselves in the ultimate Reality, and (ii) The discipline of works (कर्मयोग)…. (for) the performers of works…the discipline of works may promote life’s ends by endowing the agent with the fitness to adopt the discipline of knowledge, and not independently, by itself, whereas the discipline of knowledge, generated by that of works, is totally independent means to life’s supreme end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sri Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=101-103|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[Shloka|Sloka]], the word ''Nishtha'' means ‘devoted to’, ‘established in’. Faith with trust and dedication is called ''[[Śraddhā|shraddha]]''; faith with trust and confidence is ''nishtha'', in this ''sloka'', [[Krishna]] speaks about the twofold path of faith and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita: The Elixir of Life|author=T.N.Dhar|publisher=Mittal Publications|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8jlfTJ_0OMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Nishtha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ft44U63VOcmxrgfw2oCgCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-knowledge (''atma jnana'') can exist when self-knowledge is not fully established; ''Jnana-nishtha'' refers to self-knowledge that is fully assimilated and established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free From “Me”: Vedanta Notes|author=Paul Bahder|publisher=Vision of Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92&amp;dq=Nishtha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feA4U8WbIcmJrQfK4IGoAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanatkumara]] tells [[Narada]] ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VII.xx.1 and VII.xxi.1) that when one serves devotedly, then one becomes endowed with faith; without serving devotedly one does not acquire faith, and that when one acts, then one serves devotedly. The word ''Nishtha'' or 'devotion', appearing in the former passage, is used to mean - 'steadiness'. Even though the text says nothing about a teacher, to Sankara it indicates the steadfast seeking of a teacher’s wisdom for acquiring knowledge of [[Brahman]]; and to [[Swami Prabhavananda|Prabhavananda]] it indicates gain of faith by attending on a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishad – Commentary-full|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNzTC6Nmy6gC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=nishtha+++upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vRE5U4XoDImzrAeXmIHgAg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nishtha%20%20%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara states – A distinction has been made between ''Jnana-nishtha'' (ज्ञान-निष्ठा) and ''Karma-nishtha'' (कर्म-निष्ठा).Vedic works are intended for him only who has desires; the renunciation of these works is enjoined on him who seeks only the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Vedanta Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0XRJ8zZT8cC&amp;pg=PA560&amp;dq=Nishtha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feA4U8WbIcmJrQfK4IGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Vivekananda]] the word ''Nishtha'' meant –'singleness of attachment'; he states –" That singleness of attachment (Nishtha) to a loved object, without which no genuine love can grow, is very often also the cause of the denunciation of everything else. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta Philosophy: Lectures on Raja Yoga|author=Vivekananda|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWipfV9zHJgC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=Nishtha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feA4U8WbIcmJrQfK4IGoAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Grammatical significance==

[[Sutra]] I.i.26 of [[Pāṇini]] in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] defines ''Nishta'' in ''Sukta'' I.i.26 which reads - क्तक्तवतू निष्ठा – that the affixes of the Past Participles - ''kta'' and ''katavatu'', are called ''Nishtha''. In this text, Panini in accordance with the context of their use and application expounds and explains many rules relating to the duplication and reduplication of many words. The actual affixes are त, तवत्, the क and उ being indicatory; they being कित् are liable to कित् affixes such as - कृतः, कृतवान्, भुक्तः, भुक्तवान्, in accordance with rule I.i.5, the force of indicatory उ  to indicate that in forming the feminine of nouns ending in an affix having an indicatory vowel of uk pratyahara – उ, ऋ, लृ  ङीप् (ई) must be added such as – कृतवत् (masculine), कृतवती (feminine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbzVy6vqyCkC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Nishtha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ft44U63VOcmxrgfw2oCgCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When the ''nishta'' follows (निष्ठावान्) there is vocalization such as in the case of वचिस्वपियजादिनां किति (VI.1.15) – The semivowels of the roots वच्, स्वप् and यजादि verbs are vocalized when followed by an affix having an indicatory क; thus with the Past Participle क्त and क्तवतु, उक्तः, उक्तवान्; सुप्तः, सुप्तवान्; इष्टः, इष्टवान्; or as in the case of सत्यः पूर्वस्य (VI.1.23) – The verb स्त्या (स्त्यै and ष्ठ्यै) when preceded by प्र changes its semivowel to vowel, when a ''nishtha'' affix follows, प्रस्तीतः or प्रस्तीतवान् ||, then,  त is optionally changed to  न as प्रस्तीनः and प्रस्तीनवान् ||.The substitute of the ''nishtha'' is considered ''siddha'' or 'effective' when applying rules relating to the change of  letter to प, to accent, to affix and to the addition of the augment इट्.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Ashtadhyayi of Panini Vol.2|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=1047,1051,1048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTChci828qoC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Nishtha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zt04U-HeI4rGrAe1xoE4&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule - श्वीदितः निष्ठायाम् (VII.2.14) states that when following the verbal root श्वि or any root which has ईकारः as a इत्, a निष्ठा does not take the augment इट्. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tattvabodhini|publisher=Sanskrit.org|url=http://avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=sutras:7-2-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nominal identity''' is the [[identity (disambiguation)|identity]] in name only as opposed to the individual experience of that identity. The concept is often used in sociology, psychology and linguistics.

==Social sciences==
Nominal identity is the name to which one identifies, or calls oneself (i.e. general "African American," "Irish," "Straight," "Gay," "Female," "Male"). Whereas '''virtual identity''' is the experience of that identity, "The latter is, in a sense, what the name means; this is primarily a matter of its consequences for those who bear it, and can change while the nominal identity remains the same (and vice versa)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first= Richard |title=Rethinking Ethnicity: Arguments and Explorations |publisher=Sage Publications LTD |year=2001 |location=London, UK |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoOj0SSrQrYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZnfdIAETQH&amp;sig=MWuGxzYHP_0uU-gENR0_tEDEP4I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20%22nominal%20identity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who self-identify as "gay," the term may not confer the same experience for two people or even between various geographical or cultural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first=Richard |title=Social Identity |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |location=Oxon, UK |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRIe8YaaBIIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YVpKCmNEHi&amp;sig=fVvb72cDaQCPAQMvWP3fK97xUZo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, while one may talk about a "chair," "chair" itself can entail many forms, from arm chair to ladder back to even tree stump, if the experience of "chair" is something upon which a person sits.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] uses the term nominal identity in ''[[Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]]'' to mean both that which the identity of a subject is named and also where identity is an insignificant measurement or representation of the "perceived reality" of a subject or phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink= Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location= Cambridge, MA |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+of+the+%27indicators%27&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location=Cambridge, MA |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+%28that%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further clarify, for Bourdieu nominal identity can often mean "face value" or "appearance." He often mentions the term nominal identity in order to illustrate the idea of a more complex reality, beyond the name, within the studied subject.

===Nominal identity in ethnicity===
Ethnic identity is a "social identity arising through group formation, individual identification with a group, and interaction between different ethnic groups."&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |date=2000-09-01 |first=Henry E. |last=Brady |author2=Cynthia S. Kaplan  |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=56–91 |doi=10.1007/BF02699766 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/lf5autv45gqym5we/ |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry E. Brady and Cynthia S. Kaplan compiled a study called "Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity" that takes a look at ethnicity as a nominal identity. Their study proposed whether or not "the attitudes of members of the group with the more salient identity can be completely explained by its nominal identity while the attitudes of the members of the group with less salient identity require a graded measure of ethnicity."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt;

Brady and Kaplan focused on the country Estonia, where they posited two groups: "Estonians," and one that they call the "Slavs," a collective group of Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. They chose this geographical area in particular because of the "centrality of ethnicity in the politics of transition in the USSR."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; media usage (such as television, radio, or newspaper, whether it was the Estonia language Republic television or Russian-language media), individuals who identify themselves with another nationality, and the language used at home.

Brady and Kaplan concluded that "ethnicity is not always a nominal characteristic"&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; for these two groups in Estonia. It is only nominal when most salient. "Ethnic identity ... causes individuals within a group to form their attitudes based upon their nominal identity".&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; Individuals may generalize themselves in a certain category such as their nationality, but when it comes down to variables of different degrees in formulating their ethnicity, it is no longer nominal. It is their way of dividing themselves from a generalized name.

==Linguistics==
Nominal identity in [[linguistics]] pertains to the identity of a word or group of words functioning as a noun or an adjective within a sentence's structure. Specifically, it relates to how one can look at a sentence and propose a different understanding of that sentence through the analysis of its identity defined in its lexical construct, such as in the example used by Chris Barker&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Squibs and Discussion: Individuation and Quantification. |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |date=Fall 1999 |first=Chris |last= Barker |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=683–691 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/002438999554264 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1162/002438999554264}}&lt;/ref&gt; when discussing one of [[Manfred Krifka]]'s study "Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |year=1990 |first=Manfred |last=Krifka |volume=13 |pages=487–520 |url= http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s07/events/krifka90.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1007/bf00627291}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year."&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the surface, the proposition suggests that 4,000 distinct ships passed through the lock last year. However, as Krifka points out in his study, one could say that there were fewer than 4,000 distinct ships and that some of those ships passed through the lock more than once. Individuals reading this sentence could argue about the interpretation of this sentence. The outcome could be many interpretations when looking at the sentence more closely and determining what variables were taken into consideration when making this statement.&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;

In [[computational geometry]], a '''power diagram''', also called a '''Laguerre–Voronoi diagram''', '''Dirichlet cell complex''', '''radical Voronoi tesselation''' or a '''sectional Dirichlet tesselation''', is a partition of the [[Euclidean plane]] into [[polygon]]al cells defined from a set of circles. The cell for a given circle ''C'' consists of all the points for which the [[Power of a point|power distance]] to ''C'' is smaller than the power distance to the other circles. The power diagram is a form of generalized [[Voronoi diagram]], and coincides with the Voronoi diagram of the circle centers in the case that all the circles have equal radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Definition==
[[File:Valor de la potencia de un punto - caso exterior.svg|thumb|The power of a point ''P'' outside of a given circle]]
If ''C'' is a circle and ''P'' is a point outside ''C'', then the [[Power of a point|power]] of ''P'' with respect to ''C'' is the square of the length of a line segment from ''P'' to a point ''T'' of tangency with ''C''. Equivalently, if ''P'' has distance ''d'' from the center of the circle, and the circle has radius ''r'', then (by the [[Pythagorean theorem]]) the power is ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The same formula ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may be extended to all points in the plane, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of ''C'': points on ''C'' have zero power, and points inside ''C'' have negative power.&lt;ref name="iim85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e87"/&gt;

The power diagram of a set of ''n'' circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a partition of the plane into ''n'' regions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (called cells), such that a point ''P'' belongs to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; whenever circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the circle minimizing the power of ''P''.&lt;ref name="iim85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e87"/&gt;

[[File:Radical axis intersecting circles.svg|thumb|The radical axis of two intersecting circles. The power diagram of the two circles is the partition of the plane into two halfplanes formed by this line.]]
In the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the power diagram consists of two [[halfplane]]s, separated by a line called the [[radical axis]] or chordale of the two circles. Along the radical axis, both circles have equal power. More generally, in any power diagram, each cell ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[convex polygon]], the intersection of the halfspaces bounded by the radical axes of circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with each other circle. Triples of cells meet at [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the diagram, which are the radical centers of the three circles whose cells meet at the vertex.&lt;ref name="iim85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e87"/&gt;

==Related constructions==
The power diagram may be seen as a weighted form of the [[Voronoi diagram]] of a set of point sites, a partition of the plane into cells within which one of the sites is closer than all the other sites. Other forms of [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] include the additively weighted Voronoi diagram, in which each site has a weight that is added to its distance before comparing it to the distances to the other sites, and the multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram, in which the weight of a site is multiplied by its distance before comparing it to the distances to the other sites. In contrast, in the power diagram, we may view each circle center as a site, and each circle's squared radius as a weight that is subtracted from the [[quadrance|squared distance]] before comparing it to other squared distances. In the case that all the circle radii are equal, this subtraction makes no difference to the comparison, and the power diagram coincides with the Voronoi diagram.&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e87"/&gt;

A planar power diagram may also be interpreted as a planar cross-section of an unweighted three-dimensional Voronoi diagram. In this interpretation, the set of circle centers in the cross-section plane are the perpendicular projections of the three-dimensional Voronoi sites, and the squared radius of each circle is a constant ''K'' minus the squared distance of the corresponding site from the cross-section plane, where ''K'' is chosen large enough to make all these radii positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Like the Voronoi diagram, the power diagram may be generalized to Euclidean spaces of any dimension. The power diagram of ''n'' spheres in ''d'' dimensions is combinatorially equivalent to the intersection of a set of ''n'' upward-facing halfspaces in ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 dimensions, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt;

==Algorithms and applications==
Two-dimensional power diagrams may be constructed by an algorithm that runs in time O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'').&lt;ref name="iim85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt; More generally, because of the equivalence with higher-dimensional halfspace intersections, ''d''-dimensional power diagrams (for ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) may be constructed by an algorithm that runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^{\lceil d/2\rceil})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="a87"/&gt;

The power diagram may be used as part of an efficient algorithm for computing the volume of a union of spheres. Intersecting each sphere with its power diagram cell gives its contribution to the total union, from which the volume may be computed in time proportional to the complexity of the power diagram.&lt;ref name="abi88"&gt;{{citation

{{one source|date=January 2015}}
In [[political science]] and [[political history]], the term '''power vacuum,''' also known as a power void, is an analogy between a physical [[vacuum]], to the [[politics|political]] condition "when someone has lost control of something and no one has replaced them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/power-vacuum|title=power vacuum Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation can occur when a [[government]] has no identifiable central [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]]. The physical analogy suggests that in a power vacuum, other forces will tend to "rush in" to fill the vacuum as soon as it is created, perhaps in the form of an armed [[militia]] or [[insurgency|insurgents]], [[military]] [[Coup d'état|coup]], [[warlord]] or [[dictator]]. The term is also often used in [[organized crime]] when a [[crime family]] becomes vulnerable to competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9037101-mob-murder-and-the-hamilton-connection/|title=Mob, murder and the Hamilton connection|date=16 November 2018|publisher=thespec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hereditary or statutory [[order of succession]] or effective [[succession planning]] are orderly ways to resolve questions of succession to positions of power. When such methods are unavailable, such as in failed [[dictatorship]]s or [[civil war]]s, a power vacuum arises, which prompts a '''power struggle''' entailing [[politics|political]] competition, [[violence]], or (usually) both. A power vacuum can also occur after a [[constitutional crisis]] in which large portions of the government resign or are removed, creating unclear succession.

== Historical examples ==

Historic examples include the [[death of Alexander the Great]], the 11th century power vacuum in the middle east which allowed the [[Seljuks]] to take over, the defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the decrease in power of Great Britain and France in the Middle East after the [[Suez Crisis]].

During the course of the [[Ming treasure voyages]] (1405-1433), the Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]] was the dominant political and military force within the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=fin92/&gt; However, in 1433, the Chinese government withdrew their [[Chinese treasure fleet|treasure fleet]] and thus left a large void within the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=fin92&gt;{{cite journal | last=Finlay | first=Robert | title=Portuguese and Chinese Maritime Imperialism: Camoes's Lusiads and Luo Maodeng's Voyage of the San Bao Eunuch|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1992 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=225–241 | jstor=178944 | ref=harv | doi=10.1017/S0010417500017667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary examples ==

When in 2003 the [[United States]] led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|a coalition]] to oust [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iraq War]], the absence of an all-out Iraqi opposition force at war with government forces meant that once the [[Ba'ath Party]] was removed, no local figures were on hand to immediately assume the now-vacant administerial posts. For this reason, [[Paul Bremer]] was appointed by the United States government as the interim head of state to oversee the transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/CPA_ORHA/Doc_128_CPA_Legal_Instruments.pdf Memo to Bremer from Office of General Counsel, CPA dated 22 May 2003, Retrieved February 28, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113023438/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/CPA_ORHA/Doc_128_CPA_Legal_Instruments.pdf |date=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other western-led interventions such as in [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Kosovo]] (1999) and [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libya]] (2011) where the initial claim of justification in each case was a humanitarian matter, there had been active opposition fighting on the ground to oust the relevant governments (in the case of Kosovo, this meant removal of state forces from the desired territory rather than ousting the government itself). Subsequently, successor entities were immediately effective in Libya and Kosovo.

The word [[probability]] has been used in a variety of ways since it was first applied to the mathematical study of [[games of chance]].  Does probability measure the real, physical tendency of something to occur or is it a measure of how strongly one believes it will occur, or does it draw on both these elements?  In answering such questions, mathematicians interpret the probability values of [[probability theory]].

"There are several schools of thought regarding the interpretation of probabilities, none of them without flaws, internal contradictions, or paradoxes." (p 1129) 
"There are no standard classifications of probability interpretations, and even the more popular ones may suffer subtle variations from text to text." (p 1130) 
The classification in this article is representative, as are the authors and ideas claimed for each classification.&lt;/ref&gt; of '''probability interpretations''' which can be called "physical" and "evidential" probabilities.  Physical probabilities, which are also called objective or [[frequency probability|frequency probabilities]], are associated with random physical systems such as roulette wheels, rolling dice and radioactive atoms.  In such systems, a given type of event (such as a die yielding a six) tends to occur at a persistent rate, or "relative frequency", in a long run of trials.  Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain, these stable frequencies. The two main kinds of theory of physical probability are [[frequency probability|frequentist]] accounts (such as those of Venn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Logic of Chance |last= Venn |first= John |authorlink= John Venn |year= 1876 |publisher= MacMillan |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=es0AAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reichenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The theory of probability, an inquiry into the logical and mathematical foundations of the calculus of probability |last= Reichenbach |first= Hans |authorlink= Hans Reichenbach |year= 1948 |publisher= University of California Press}}  English translation of the original 1935 German.

Evidential probability, also called [[Bayesian probability]], can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent its subjective plausibility, or the degree to which the statement is supported by the available evidence.  On most accounts, evidential probabilities are considered to be degrees of belief, defined in terms of dispositions to gamble at certain odds.  The four main evidential interpretations are the classical (e.g. Laplace's)&lt;ref name=LaPlace /&gt; interpretation, the subjective interpretation (de Finetti&lt;ref name=deF&gt;{{cite book |last1= de Finetti |first1= Bruno |authorlink1= Bruno de Finetti |editor1-first= H.

There are also evidential interpretations of probability covering groups, which are often labelled as 'intersubjective' (proposed by [[Donald A. Gillies|Gillies]]&lt;ref name=gil&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillies | first = Donald |authorlink= Donald A. Gillies | title = Philosophical theories of probability | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0415182768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rowbottom&lt;ref name=row /&gt;).

Some interpretations of probability are associated with approaches to [[statistical inference]], including theories of [[estimation theory|estimation]] and [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]].  The physical interpretation, for example, is taken by followers of "frequentist" statistical methods, such as [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]]. Statisticians of the opposing [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] school typically accept the existence and importance of physical probabilities, but also consider the calculation of evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics.  This article, however, focuses on the interpretations of probability rather than theories of statistical inference.

The terminology of this topic is rather confusing, in part because probabilities are studied within a variety of academic fields. The word "frequentist" is especially tricky. To philosophers it refers to a particular theory of physical probability, one that has more or less been abandoned. To scientists, on the other hand, "[[frequentist probability]]" is just another name for physical (or objective) probability. Those who promote Bayesian inference view "frequentist statistics" as an approach to statistical inference that recognises only physical probabilities.  Also the word "objective", as applied to probability, sometimes means exactly what "physical" means here, but is also used of evidential probabilities that are fixed by rational constraints, such as logical and epistemic probabilities.

{{quote|It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel. Doubtless, much of the disagreement is merely terminological and would disappear under sufficiently sharp analysis.|(Savage, 1954, p 2)&lt;ref name=savage /&gt;}}

==Philosophy==
The '''philosophy of probability''' presents problems chiefly in matters of [[epistemology]] and the uneasy interface between [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.
[[Probability theory]] is an established field of study in mathematics.  It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of [[games of chance]] between [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bskyrms/bio/readings/pascal_fermat.pdf Fermat and Pascal on Probability] (@ socsci.uci.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized and rendered [[axiom]]atic as a distinct branch of mathematics by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in the twentieth century.  In axiomatic form, mathematical statements about probability theory carry the same sort of epistemological confidence within the [[philosophy of mathematics]] as are shared by other mathematical statements.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo E. Szabo, ''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/colloquium/2001/October/Szabo/angol011008/angol011008.html A Physicalist Interpretation of Probability]'' (Talk presented on the Philosophy of Science Seminar, Eötvös, Budapest, 8 October 2001.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo E. Szabo, Objective probability-like things with and without  objective indeterminism, Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 38 (2007) 626–634 (''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/leszabo/Preprints/lesz_no_probability_preprint.pdf Preprint]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical analysis originated in observations of the behaviour of game equipment such as [[playing card]]s and [[dice]], which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of [[Principle of indifference|indifference]].  This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that "''it will probably rain''", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence.  Likewise, when it is written that "the most probable explanation" of the name of [[Ludlow, Massachusetts]] "is that it was named after [[Roger Ludlow]]", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.

[[Thomas Bayes]] attempted to provide a [[logic]] that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, [[Bayesian probability]] is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.

Though probability initially had somewhat mundane motivations, its modern influence and use is widespread ranging from [[evidence-based medicine]], through [[Six sigma]], all the way to the [[Probabilistically checkable proof]] and the [[String theory landscape]].

==Classical definition==
{{Main|Classical definition of probability}}
The first attempt at mathematical rigour in the field of probability, championed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is now known as the '''classical definition'''. Developed from studies of games of chance (such as rolling [[dice]]) it states that probability is shared equally between all the possible outcomes, provided these outcomes can be deemed equally likely.&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.1)

{{Quotation|The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.|Pierre-Simon Laplace|A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities&lt;ref name=LaPlace&gt;Laplace, P. S., 1814, English edition 1951, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities, New York: Dover Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{clear}}
[[Image:Dice.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The classical definition of probability works well for situations with only a finite number of equally-likely outcomes.]]
This can be represented mathematically as follows:
If a random experiment can result in N mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes and if N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of these outcomes result in the occurrence of the event A, the '''probability of A''' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;P(A) = {N_A \over N} &lt;/math&gt;.

There are two clear limitations to the classical definition.&lt;ref name="Spanos"&gt;{{cite book | last = Spanos | first = Aris | title = Statistical foundations of econometric modelling | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 978-0521269124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, it is applicable only to situations in which there is only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a [[coin]] until it rises heads, give rise to an [[Infinity|infinite]] set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.

==Frequentism==
[[Image:Roulette wheel.jpg|left|200px|thumb|For frequentists, the probability of the ball landing in any pocket can be determined only by repeated trials in which the observed result converges to the underlying probability ''in the long run''.]]
{{Main|Frequency probability}}
Frequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time,&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as [[aleatory]] probability.  The events are assumed to be governed by some [[randomness|random]] physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see [[determinism]]); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing [[dice]] or spinning a [[roulette]] wheel; an example of the second kind is [[radioactive decay]]. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.

If we denote by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n_a&lt;/math&gt; the number of occurrences of an event &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; trials, then if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to +\infty}{n_a \over n}=p &lt;/math&gt;  we say that ''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(\mathcal{A})=p&lt;/math&gt;.

The frequentist view has its own problems. It is of course impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only a finite number of repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If we acknowledge the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example “[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf What is the Chance of an Earthquake?]” &lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David and Philip B. Stark (2003)"What is the Chance of an Earthquake?" Earthquake Science and Seismic Risk.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjectivism==
[[Image:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gambling]] odds reflect the average bettor's 'degree of belief' in the outcome.]]
{{Main|Bayesian probability}}
Subjectivists, also known as '''Bayesians''' or followers of '''epistemic probability''', give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it as a measure of the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation. [[Epistemic]] or subjective probability is sometimes called '''[[Credence (statistics)|credence]]''', as opposed to the term '''chance''' for a propensity probability.

Some examples of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true, and to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on the evidence presented.

Gambling odds don't reflect the bookies' belief in a likely winner, so much as the other bettors' belief, because the bettors are actually betting against one another.  The odds are set based on how many people have bet on a possible winner, so that even if the high odds players always win, the bookies will always make their percentages anyway.

The use of Bayesian probability raises the philosophical debate as to whether it can contribute valid [[theory of justification|justifications]] of [[belief]].

Bayesians point to the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]]&lt;ref name=ramsey /&gt; (p 182) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]]&lt;ref name=deF /&gt; (p 103) as proving that subjective beliefs must follow the [[laws of probability]] if they are to be [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaynes | first = E. T. | title = Probability theory the logic of science | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0521592710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence casts doubt that humans will have coherent beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kahneman | first = Daniel | title = Thinking, fast and slow | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0374275631 }}  The book contains numerous examples of the difference between idealized and actual thought.  "[W]hen called upon to judge probability, people actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability." (p 98)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grove | first1 = William M. | last2 = Meehl | first2 = Paul E. | title = Comparative efficiency of informal (subjective, impressionistic) and formal (mechanical, algorithmic) prediction procedures: The clinical-statistical controversy | journal = Psychology, Public Policy, and Law | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–332 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1037/1076-8971.2.2.293 | url = http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/167GroveMeehlClinstix.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111030214359/http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/167GroveMeehlClinstix.pdf | archivedate = 30 October 2011 | df = dmy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.592 }}  Statistical decisions are consistently superior to the subjective decisions of experts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Bayesian probability involves specifying a [[prior probability]]. This may be obtained from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} associated with an [[urn model]] or a [[thought experiment]].  The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement: different people may assign different prior probabilities, known as the [[reference class problem]].
The "[[sunrise problem]]" provides an example.

==Propensity==
{{Main|Propensity probability}}

Propensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Martin | title = An introduction to decision theory | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2009 | page = 140 | isbn = 978-0521716543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of objective probability is sometimes called 'chance'.

Propensities, or chances, are not relative frequencies, but purported causes of the observed stable relative frequencies.  Propensities are invoked to explain why repeating a certain kind of experiment will generate given outcome types at persistent rates, which are known as propensities or chances. Frequentists are unable to take this approach, since relative frequencies do not exist for single tosses of a coin, but only for large ensembles or collectives (see "single case possible" in the table above).&lt;ref name="de Elía" /&gt; In contrast, a propensitist is able to use the [[law of large numbers]] to explain the behaviour of long-run frequencies.  This law, which is a consequence of the axioms of probability, says that if (for example) a coin is tossed repeatedly many times, in such a way that its probability of landing heads is the same on each toss, and the outcomes are probabilistically independent, then the relative frequency of heads will be close to the probability of heads on each single toss.  This law allows that stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of invariant ''single-case'' probabilities. In addition to explaining the emergence of stable relative frequencies, the idea of propensity is motivated by the desire to make sense of single-case probability attributions in quantum mechanics, such as the probability of [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of a particular [[atom]] at a particular time.

The main challenge facing propensity theories is to say exactly what propensity means.  (And then, of course, to show that propensity thus defined has the required properties.)  At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.

A propensity theory of probability was given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref name="Miller 1975 123–132"&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Miller|first=Richard W.| authorlink6=Richard W.

Peirce, however.&lt;ref name="Miller 1975 123–132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haack 1977 63–104"/&gt; Popper noted that the outcome of a physical experiment is produced by a certain set of "generating conditions".  When we repeat an experiment, as the saying goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions.  To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity ''p'' of producing the outcome ''E'' means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which ''E'' occurred with limiting relative frequency ''p''.  For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.

A number of other philosophers, including [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] and [[Donald A. Gillies]], have proposed propensity theories somewhat similar to Popper's.

Other propensity theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ronald N. Giere]] |title=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |chapter=Objective Single Case Probabilities and the Foundations of Statistics |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0049237X |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X09703805 |volume=73 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-444-10491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do not explicitly define propensities at all, but rather see propensity as defined by the theoretical role it plays in science.  They argued, for example, that physical magnitudes such as [[electrical charge]] cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms of what they do (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges).  In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.

What roles does physical probability play in science?  What are its properties?  One central property of chance is that, when known, it constrains rational belief to take the same numerical value.  David Lewis called this the ''Principal Principle'',&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.3 &amp; 3.5) a term that philosophers have mostly adopted. For example, suppose you are certain that a particular biased coin has propensity 0.32 to land heads every time it is tossed.  What is then the correct price for a gamble that pays $1 if the coin lands heads, and nothing otherwise?  According to the Principal Principle, the fair price is 32 cents.

==Logical, epistemic, and inductive probability==
{{Main|Probabilistic logic}}

It is widely recognized that the term "probability" is sometimes used in contexts where it has nothing to do with physical randomness.  Consider, for example, the claim that the extinction of the dinosaurs was '''probably''' caused by a large meteorite hitting the earth.  Statements such as "Hypothesis H is probably true" have been interpreted to mean that the (presently available) [[empirical evidence]] (E, say) supports H to a high degree.  This degree of support of H by E has been called the '''logical''' probability of H given E, or the '''epistemic probability''' of H given E, or the '''inductive probability''' of H given E.

The differences between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief.  Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' [[A Treatise on Probability|Treatise on Probability]]&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief.  They are degrees of (partial) [[entailment]], or degrees of [[logical consequence]], not degrees of [[belief]].  (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.)  [[Frank P. Ramsey]], on the other hand, was skeptical about the existence of such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is "the logic of partial belief".&lt;ref name=ramsey /&gt; (p 157)  In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply ''are'' degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely ''constrain'' degrees of rational belief.

Another point of disagreement concerns the ''uniqueness'' of evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge.  [[Rudolf Carnap]] held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence.  Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value.  Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they all have the same information.

==Prediction==
{{Main|Predictive inference}}
An alternative account of probability emphasizes the role of ''prediction'' – predicting future observations on the basis of past observations, not on unobservable parameters. In its modern form, it is mainly in the Bayesian vein. This was the main function of probability before the 20th century,&lt;ref name="geisser"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC Predictive Inference: An Introduction]'', [[Seymour Geisser]], [[CRC Press]], 1993 {{isbn|0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system that was observed with error, such as in [[celestial mechanics]].

The modern predictive approach was pioneered by [[Bruno de Finetti]], with the central idea of [[exchangeability]] – that future observations should behave like past observations.&lt;ref name="geisser" /&gt; This view came to the attention of the Anglophone world with the 1974 translation of de Finetti's book,&lt;ref name="geisser" /&gt; and has
since been propounded by such statisticians as [[Seymour Geisser]].

==Axiomatic probability==
The mathematics of probability can be developed on an entirely axiomatic basis that is independent of any interpretation: see the articles on [[probability theory]] and [[probability axioms]] for a detailed treatment.

However, quite frequently adolescents take part in peer relationships that are harmful for their psychological development. Adolescents tend to form various [[clique]]s and belong to different [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowds]] based on their activity interests, music and clothing preferences, as well as their cultural or ethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., &amp; Mounts, N. (1989, April). Peer groups structures in single versus multiethnic high schools. Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups differ in their sociometric or popularity status, which often create unhealthy, aggression-victimization based dynamics between groups. Different forms of aggression can also be used to control dynamics and sociometric status within a group. Sometimes aggression is directed to an individual rather than to any apparent social group. Primary reasons for victimization include looks and speech; adolescents are also frequently bullied because of a disability, particular ethnicity, or religion.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007"&gt;Klomek, A.

=== Definition ===

Relational aggression is defined as a type of aggression that is "intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships".&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2001"&gt;{{Cite book|page=100|title= Study Guide for Use with Adolescence|last1= Steinberg | authorlink = Laurence Steinberg |first1= Laurence D.|last2= Reyome |first2= Nancy Dodge|last3= Bjornsen |first3= Christopher A.|isbn=9780072414615|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWXtbGYpAu4C|date=2001|publisher= McGraw-Hill Higher Education |quote=relational aggression&amp;nbsp;– intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational aggression, according to Daniel Olweus&lt;ref name="Olweus 1991"&gt;Olweus, D. (1991). Bully/victim problems among schoolchildren: Basic facts and effects of a school based intervention program. In D. J. Pepler &amp; K. H. Rubin (Eds.), ''The development and treatment of childhood aggression'' (pp. 441-448). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[bullying]]. Bullying in general, is defined as physically or psychologically violent re-occurring and not provoked acts, where the bully and victim have unequal physical strength or/and psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;Olweus, D. (1999). Sweden. In P. K. Smith, Y. Morita, J. Junger-Tas, D. Olweus, R. Catalano, &amp; P.Slee (Eds.), The nature of school bullying: A cross-national perspective (pp. 7-27). New York:Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These key conditions apply to all types of bullying: [[Verbal abuse|verbal]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], relational.&lt;ref name="Olweus 1991" /&gt;

== Types ==
Relational aggression may be either covert or direct, and is distinct from other forms of indirect aggression.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."&gt;
{{Cite journal |first1=Diana|last1=Murray-Close |first2= Jamie M. |last2= Ostrov |first3= David A. |last3= Nelson |first4= Nicki R. |last4= Crick |first5= Emil F. |last5= Coccaro |title= Proactive, reactive, and romantic relational aggression in adulthood: Measurement, predictive validity, gender differences, and association with Intermittent Explosive Disorder |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |date=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.09.005|pmc=2849926 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be proactive (planned and goal-oriented) or reactive (in response to perceived threats, hostility, or anger), and it can be, for instance, peer-directed or romantic.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt;
Several studies have indicated substantive differences between proactive and reactive relational aggression. Reactive aggression is associated with a tendency to assume that others' intentions are hostile ([[hostile attribution bias]]).&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt;

Most studies of relational aggression have involved children or adolescents; the study of relational aggression in adults presents problems.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt; Relational aggression is a common aspect of [[workplace bullying]], and is a characteristic behaviour of [[Psychopathy in the workplace|psychopaths in the workplace]], so it is commonplace amongst adults as well as children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Manifestations ==
Manifestations of relational aggression include:&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008"&gt;[[Laurence Steinberg|Steinberg, L.]] (2008). Adolescence, 8th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluding others from social activities;
* Damaging victim's reputations with others by spreading rumors and [[gossip]]ing about the victim, or [[humiliating]] him/her in front of others;
* Withdrawing attention and friendship.

[[Psychological manipulation]] and [[coercion]] can also be considered as a type of relational aggression.

Most recent research has been focusing on [[cyber-bullying]], which is a relatively new yet increasingly popular way of engaging in both verbal and relational aggression due to growing importance of various communication and technology devices in modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyberbullying.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that internet meanness is more common among girls than boys.&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==

Many studies in the U.S. and Europe show that at least 30% of students report having been bullied in one or another way.{{Citation needed|reason=What studies?|date=August 2013}} Some studies indicate even higher percentages of victimization.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt; Bullying in schools happens in all forms and at various ages, although peer bullying has the highest prevalence in 6th-8th grades.&lt;ref&gt;Jankauskiene, R., Kardelis, K., Sukys, S., &amp; Kardeliene, L. (2008). Associations between school bullying and psychosocial factors. Social Behavior and Personality, 36(2), 145-162&lt;/ref&gt; The most common forms of bullying are verbal with relational, or various forms of ostracism, coming in second.&lt;ref&gt;Valeckiene, D. (2005). Priekabiavimo kaip vienos dazniausiai naudojamos agresijos formos mokykloje raiSkos analiz (The analysis of bullying as one of the most prevalent form of aggression at schools). Sveikatos ir socialiniu mokslu taikomieji tyrimai: sandura ir saveika, 1, 49-65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===

Although it can be used by both genders, relational aggression is more commonly associated with girls.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001"&gt;Nansel, Tonja R., et al. "Bullying behaviors among US youth: Prevalence and association with psychosocial adjustment." JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association, v. 285 issue 16, 2001, p. 2094-2100&lt;/ref&gt; Findings of a study by Rivers and Smith&lt;ref&gt;Rivers I, Smith PK. Types of bullying behaviour and their correlates. Aggressive Behav. 1994;20:359-368.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that while verbal aggression occurs with similar frequency in both sexes, direct [[Physical abuse|physical aggression]] is more common among boys and indirect aggression is more common among girls. In another study by Baldry&lt;ref&gt;Baldry AC. Bullying among Italian middle school students. Sch Psychol Int. 1998;19:361-374.&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that boys are more likely to engage in bullying behaviors such as threats, physical harm, rejection, and name-calling, while girls are most likely to use name-calling, teasing, rumors, rejection, and taking personal belongings. Based on these findings, girls do seem to use relational aggression more than boys.

In addition, recent international research shows that both genders tend to use relational aggression, but girls are more aware and distressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;French, D. C., Jansen, E. A., &amp; Pidada, S. (2002). United States and Indonesian children's and adolescents' reports of relational aggression by disliked peers. Child Development, 73(4), 1143-1150. {{doi|10.1111/1467-8624.00463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galen, B. R., &amp; Underwood, M. K. (1997). A developmental investigation of social aggression among children. Developmental Psychology, 33(4), 589-600. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.33.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paquette, J. A., &amp; Underwood, M. K. (1999). Gender differences in young adolescents' experiences of peer victimization: Social and physical aggression. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 45(2), 242-266.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study by Horn&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S.S.(2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental psychology, 39''(1), 71-84.&lt;/ref&gt; found that girls are more likely to say that it is morally wrong to exclude someone based on their crowd membership.

Some research shows that there are certain implications when boys and girls engage in gender-atypical aggression, as girls who are more physically aggressive or boys who are highly relationally aggressive are more maladjusted than their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Nicki R. "Engagement in gender normative versus nonnormative forms of aggression: Links to social–psychological adjustment." Developmental Psychology, v. 33 issue 4, 1997, p. 610-617.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociometric status ==

[[Sociometric status]], commonly referred as [[popularity]], is one of the most significant predictors of victimization or bullying as differences in popularity can be associated with differences in social power. It is commonly believed that aggressive adolescents belong to rejected social groups. However, some research shows that they can be popular among their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, A., Bukowski, W. M., Hymel, S., &amp; Sippola, L. K. (2000). Coping with daily hassles in the peer group during early adolescence: Variations as a function of peer experience. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 10(2), 211-243. {{doi|10.1207/SJRA1002_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukowski, W. M., Sippola, L. K., &amp; Newcomb, A. F. (2000). Variations in patterns of attraction of same- and other-sex peers during early adolescence. Developmental Psychology, 36(2), 147-154. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodkin et al. (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Rodkin, P. C., Farmer, T. W., Pearl, R., &amp; Van Acker, R. (2000). Heterogeneity of popular boys: Antisocial and prosocial configurations. Developmental Psychology, 36(1), 14-24. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.36.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, describes two types of popular boys: "model" boys, who are "physically and academically competent, friendly and neither shy nor aggressive."&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; Second type is described as "tough" and such adolescents are "aggressive, physically competent, and average or below average in friendliness, academic competence, and shyness.".&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; Usually the more popular aggressive adolescents use instrumental aggression and not reactive aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Little, T. D., Brauner, J., Jones, S. M., Nock, M. K., &amp; Hawley, P. H. (2003). Rethinking aggression: A typological examination of the functions of aggression. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 49(3), 343-369. {{doi|10.1353/mpq.2003.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinstein, M. J., &amp; Cillessen, A. H. N. (2003). Forms and functions of adolescent peer aggression associated with high levels of peer status. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 49(3), 310-342. {{doi|10.1353/mpq.2003.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental aggression is defined as behavior that is deliberate and planned while reactive aggression is unplanned and impulsive.&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt;
Relational aggression can be greatly instrumental for maintaining the popularity status of a group among other groups, as well specific relationship and status dynamics inside a group. Ojala and Nesdale (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ojala, K., &amp; Nesdale, D. (2004). Bullying and social identity: The effects of group norms and distinctiveness threat on attitudes towards bullying. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 22(1), 19-35.&lt;/ref&gt; found that both victims and bullies normally come from rejected groups. Bullies chose to bully students, who are members of their social out-groups that are similar to their own in- group as a result of threatened distinctiveness. Hence, the need to maintain a unique social identity and status can be one of the causes to engage in bullying.
Using relational aggression to maintain a particular social order inside the group has been mostly observed in girl groups: if some member of the group becomes too popular and this causes imbalance in the group, other members might start rumors about the overly popular girl to diminish her status.&lt;ref&gt;Merten, D.(1997). The meaning of meanness: Popularity, competition, and conflict among junior high school girls. ''Sociology of Education, 70,''175-191&lt;/ref&gt;
Amanda Rose (2004)&lt;ref name="Rose 2004"&gt;Rose, A. J., Swenson, L. P., &amp; Waller, E. M. (2004). Overt and Relational Aggression and Perceived Popularity: Developmental Differences in Concurrent and Prospective Relations. Developmental Psychology, 40(3), 378-387. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.40.3.378}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the main purpose of using relational aggression in first place is to enhance or maintain one's social status. Many skills that are needed to be popular are also essential for being "successful" at employing relational aggression, e.g. ability to "read" people and adjust one's behavior accordingly, etc.&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; The researcher suggests that some aggressive boys are popular because they are also good at using relational aggression, and, therefore, their primary reason for popularity is not their physical but relational aggression.

== Different participation roles ==

Research shows that there are three types of rejected or [[unpopularity|unpopular]] adolescents who are very likely to be involved in bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L., &amp; Wargo, J. B. (1995). Predicting the longitudinal course associated with aggressive-rejected, aggressive (nonrejected), and rejected (nonaggressive) status.

Developmental Psychology, 28(2), 231-241. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; First type includes adolescents who are overly aggressive: they tend to get into fights, get involved in antisocial activities, and are often involved in bullying; second type includes adolescents who are withdrawn or timid and exceedingly shy and inhibited and who are more likely to be victims; third- aggressive- withdrawn- type adolescents tend to have trouble controlling their hostility, but they are also very shy and nervous about initiating friendships. The latter are likely to be bully-victims. Other students- bystanders can also choose between several roles: victim-defender, bully-reinforcer and/or assistant, and outsiders.

=== Victims ===

Victims or the unpopular withdrawn children are excessively anxious, lack social skills needed to initiate new contacts or break into a group activity.&lt;ref name="Rubin 1990"&gt;Rubin, K., LeMare, L., &amp; Lollis, S. (1990). Social withdrawal in childhood: Developmental pathways to peer rejection. In S. Asher &amp; J. Coie (Eds.), ''Peer rejection in childhood,'' pp. 217-249.

Stability and change of behavior in connection with bullying in schools. Aggressive Behav. 1998;24:205-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common underlying reasons for bullying include low socioeconomic status, disability, and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, L. J., Wolke, D., Page, A. S., Horwood, J. P., &amp; the ALSPAC Study Team (2006). Obesity and bullying: Different effects for boys and girls.

The strategies adopted by Dutch children with dyslexia to maintain their self-esteem when teased at school. Journal of Learning Disabilities, 38, 411-423.&lt;/ref&gt;
Research shows that in comparison with other adolescents victims often use worse problem solving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, T. (2009) Bullying and victimisation in school children: the role of social identity, problem-solving style, and family and school context. Social Psychology of Education, 12(1), 63 - 76.&lt;/ref&gt; They often score less than their bullies and defenders in the tests of moral competence and [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Gini 2011"&gt;Gini, G., Pozzoli, T., &amp; Hauser, M. (2011). Bullies have enhanced moral competence to judge relative to victims, but lack moral compassion. Personality and Individual Differences, 50(5), 603-608.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral competence refers to the ability to carefully consider both the consequences and prior beliefs in determining how morally right or wrong one's actions are. Victims seemed to focus primarily on the outcomes and not being as good in integrating the moral beliefs. They have difficulties in social skills, and social problem solving, as well as emotional regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Champion, K., Vernberg, E., &amp; Shipman, K. (2003). Nonbullying victims of bullies: Aggression, social skills, and friendship characteristics. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24(5), 535-551.&lt;/ref&gt; And because of their lack of social competence, victims score low on peer acceptance and popularity.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996"&gt;Salmivalli, C., Lagerspetz, K., Bjorkqvist, K., Osterman, K., &amp; et al. (1996). Bullying as a group process: Participant roles and their relations to social status within the group. Aggressive Behavior, 22(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulton 1994"&gt;Boulton, M. J., &amp; Smith, P. K. (1994). Bully/victim problems in middle-school children: Stability, self-perceived competence, peer perceptions and peer acceptance. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 12(3), 315-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are often overly sensitive to being rejected, which might originate in their relationships with parents.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G., Lebolt, A., Rincon, C., &amp; Freitas, A. L. (1998). Rejection sensitivity and children's interpersonal difficulties. Child Development, 69(4), 1074-1091. {{doi|10.2307/1132363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bullies ===

Bullies, despite being quite morally competent, tend to engage in morally wrong behaviors because of several reasons, including a lack of moral compassion.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; In general, bullies seem to engage in a kind of cold cognition and have a good theory of mind. They also have an average to good social intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; These skills seem to be especially important in order to use relational aggression in an instrumental manner—for achieving specific social goals.
As mentioned previously, male and female bullies usually score differently on sociometric measures. Male bullies often fall in the socially rejected category&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulton 1994" /&gt; while female bullies tend to fall in the controversial category. They can be popular yet not liked.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;

==== Hostile attributional bias ====

Many unpopular aggressive kids seem to engage in hostile attributional bias when analyzing the actions of others: they are more likely to interpret other children's behavior as hostile while it is not,&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1994). A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment. Psychological Bulletin, 115(1), 74-101. {{doi|10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, K. A., &amp; Coie, J. D. (1987). Social-information-processing factors in reactive and proactive aggression in children's peer groups. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53(6), 1146-1158. {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1146}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can cause the perpetuation of their aggressive behaviors.

=== Bully-victims ===

Bully- victims are people who have both experienced aggression directed towards them and have themselves engaged in [[bullying]]. They often choose to be [[Relational aggression#Bystanders|bully assistants or reinforcers]].&lt;ref name="Oh 2009"&gt;Oh, I., &amp; Hazler, R. J. (2009). Contributions of personal and situational factors to bystanders' reactions to school bullying. School Psychology International, 30(3), 291-310.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing others victimized can serve as a buffer against some psychological problems, for which these people are at risk (see  [[#Consequences of victimization|Consequences of victimization]] below). In comparison to all other groups, bully-victims are the worst off regarding their psychological adjustment and problems. They are least liked among the peers.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt;

=== Bystanders ===

Although early research has mostly focused on victims and bullies, currently more and more attention has been given to the roles of other students, or bystanders: bully-reinforcer's and assistants, victim-defenders, and outsiders.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;

==== Bully-reinforcers and assistants ====

Bully-reinforcers and assistants do not normally initiate aggressive actions themselves, but they support, reinforce, and/or assist the bully. They often have rather large friendship networks when compared to outsiders, victims, and their defenders.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; These individuals are similar to bullies in regards of their personal characteristics. Female bully- reinforcers and assistants usually score low on social acceptance and high on rejection by their peers while male bully assistants have average scores on both and bully- reinforcers are often quite popular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; The characteristic that is common among all these individuals across both genders is low level of empathy.&lt;ref name="Oh 2009" /&gt;

==== Victim-defenders ====

Victim-defenders are individuals who stand up for the victim. They are usually popular among their peers,&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; although occasionally rejected and victimized adolescents take on the defender's role.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; Defenders like to befriend other defenders and usually belong to the smallest social network of all other previously mentioned groups.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; Defenders have both advanced moral competence and high level of compassion. They also score high on the theory of mind tests. They are usually very morally engaged, have a high sense of responsibility, and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; They are also good at emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Maede, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outsiders ====

Outsiders are adolescents who like to stay away from the conflict situations, participate in spreading rumors, or actively support either side. They usually befriend other outsiders. Both male and female outsiders usually score below average on both social acceptance and rejection by their peers.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;
In general, the best predictor for whether an adolescent will choose to be a defender or an outsider in a particular situation is their relationship to the victim and/or bully.&lt;ref name="Oh 2009" /&gt; Occasionally, adolescents will feel more comfortable to intervene if they are friends of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Tisak, M. S., &amp; Tisak, J. (1996). Expectations and judgments regarding bystanders' and victims' responses to peer aggression among early adolescents. Journal of Adolescence, 19(4), 383-392.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general they will take the side of the bully or victim based on who they know better.&lt;ref&gt;Chaux, E. (2005). Role of Third Parties in Conflicts Among Colombian Children and Early Adolescents. Aggressive Behavior, 31(1), 40-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies are more likely to be friends of other bullies, as well as their reinforcers, and assistants, while victims befriend other victims.

== Consequences of victimization ==

{{Main|Victimization}}
There are serious negative consequences associated with being involved in any aggressive behaviors. And while problems with peers might be a result of one's poor [[social skills]] and maladjustment, difficulty making friends, and regular experience of aggression can also be a cause of many short and long term negative consequences on one's [[mental health]] and academic and professional achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Bagwell, C., Newcomb, A., &amp; Bukowski, W. (1998). Preadolescent friendship and peer rejection as predictors of adult adjustment. ''Child Development, 69'', 140-153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendgen, M., Vitaro, F., &amp; Bukowski, W. M.

Some negative effects persist into adulthood. In a longitudinal study, Dan Olweus (2003)&lt;ref name="Olweus 2003" /&gt; found that young adults, who were victims of bullying in adolescence, had more symptoms of depression and lower self-esteem than did their non-victimized peers. Victims are also much more likely to engage in heavy smoking later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Niemelä, S., Brunstein-Klomek, A., Sillanmäki, L., Helenius, H., Piha, J., Kumpulainen, K., ,...Sourander, A.

=== Differences in consequences of victimization for victims and bully-victims ===

There are differences in consequences among the children who are rejected and aggressive, also known as [[Relational aggression#Bully-victims|bully-victims]], and children who are rejected and withdrawn, also referred to as simply [[Relational aggression#Victims|victims]]. Aggressive individuals often have [[Conduct disorder|conduct problems]] and are involved in [[Antisocial behavior|antisocial activity]].;&lt;ref name="French 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, S.

=== Suicide ideation and attempts ===

Although victims respond to bullying in various ways, some of the most common ways include avoidance or escape behaviors, such as not going to school and running away from home. However, in some extreme cases, suicide attempts might occur.&lt;ref&gt;Batsche, G. M., &amp; Knoff, H. M. (1994). Bullies and their victims: Understanding a pervasive problem in the schools. School Psychology Review, 23(2), 165-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to non-victims, victims exhibit increased levels of [[Suicide ideation|suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holt, M. K., Finkelhor, D., &amp; Kantor, G. K. (2007). Multiple victimization experiences of urban elementary school students: Associations with psychosocial functioning and academic performance. Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 31(5), 503-515. {{doi|10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, K., &amp; Slee, P. (1999). Suicidal ideation among adolescent school children, involvement in bully–victim problems, and perceived social support. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 29(2), 119-130.&lt;/ref&gt; and are more likely to have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, M. E., Neumark-Sztainer, D., &amp; Story, M. (2003). Associations of weight-based teasing and emotional well-being among adolescents. Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine, Î51, 733-738.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim 2005"&gt;Kim, Y. S., Koh, Y. J., &amp; Leventhal, B.(2005). School bullying and suicidal risk in Korean middle school students. Pediatrics, IIS, .Í57-363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C, Guerin, S., Lynch, E., Daly, 1., &amp; Eitzpatrick, C. (2004). The relationship between bullying, depression and suicidal thoughts/behaviour in Irish adolescents. Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine, 21, 112-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Y.S. Kim (2005)&lt;ref name="Kim 2005" /&gt; found that there are some gender differences as victimized female but not male students were at significantly greater risk for suicidal ideation.
Further research has shown that increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts depend on a specific interaction between gender, frequency, and type of aggression. Relational or indirect aggression was found to be associated with depression and suicidal ideation among both genders.&lt;ref&gt;van der Wal, M. F., de Wit, C. A., &amp; Hirasing, R. A. (2003). Psychosocial health among young victims and offenders of direct and
indirect bullying, fpi/wfna, ÎÎÎ, 1312-1317.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brustein and Klomek (2007),&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt; victimization at any frequency increased the risk of depression, ideation, and attempts among girls, while only frequent victimization increased the risk of depression and ideation among males; yet, Katliala-Heino et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kaltiala-Heino R, Rimpela M, Marttunen M, Rimpela A, Rantanen P. (1999).Bullying, depression, and suicidal ideation in Finnish adolescents: school survey. BMJ. 1999;319:348-351.&lt;/ref&gt; found that severe ideation was associated with frequent victimization only among girls.

== Environmental buffers and prevention programs ==

Some adolescents are more resilient to victimization due to their personal characteristics, but there are some environmental factors such as having a best friend or great family support can decrease the risk for many negative consequences associated with victimization.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. V. E., Boivin, M., Vitaro, F., &amp; Bukowski, W. M. (1999). The power of friendship: Protection against an escalating cycle of peer victimization. Developmental Psychology, 35(1), 94-101. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.35.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research shows that support from teachers can be a significant environmental factor for higher academic achievement and school engagement. It can also increase general [[Emotional well-being|well- being]] in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, A. B., &amp; Bowen, G. L. (2004). Teacher Support and the School Engagement of Latino Middle and High School Students at Risk of School Failure. Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work Journal, 21(1), 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher attitudes towards bullying were found to moderate the extent to which victims internalize and feel distressed and express it by avoiding school and similar behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Flaspohler, P. D., Elfstrom, J. L., Vanderzee, K. L., Sink, H. E., &amp; Birchmeier, Z. (2009). Stand by me: The effects of peer and teacher support in mitigating the impact of bullying on quality of life. ''Psychology in the Schools, 46''(7), 636-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Close teacher- student relationship moderates perceived safety in the classroom, and higher perceived safety is directly linked to better classroom concentration and improved coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton, M. J., Duke, E., Holman, G., Laxton, E., Nicholas, B., Spells, R., ,...Woodmansey, H. (2009). Associations between being bullied, perceptions of safety in classroom and playground, and relationship with teacher among primary school pupils. Educational Studies, 35(3), 255-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, supportive friends, family, and teachers can be great buffers for victimized students against all negative effects of victimization.
Witnessing the harassment of others can also reduce some harmful effects of being victimized:&lt;ref&gt;Nishina, A., &amp; Juvonen, J. (2005). Daily Reports of Witnessing and Experiencing Peer Harassment in Middle School. Child Development, 76(2), 435-450. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00855.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; victims-only feel more humiliated and angry than victims-witnesses on the same day. Being singled out and picked on feels worse than being one of many victimized students. This explains why in ethnically diverse schools victimized students experience worse psychological outcomes when their ethnic group is in majority, because then they are more likely to attribute it to their personal shortcomings and not to their group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Bellmore, A., Nishina, A., &amp; Juvonen, J. (in press)."It must be me": Ethnic context and attributions for peer victimization.''Child Development''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention programs ===

There are many prevention programs, which have been designed to improve social skills of the unpopular and victimized adolescents. Prevention programs usually focus on one of the three strategies:
# teaching social skills like self-expression, leadership, and questioning of others about themselves;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, J., &amp; de Armaa, A. (1989). Social relationships in adolescence: Skill development and training. In J. Worell &amp; F. Danner (Eds.), ''The adolescent as decision-maker.'' San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Repinski, D., &amp; Leffert, N. (1994, February). Adolescents' relations with friends: The effects of a psychoeducational intervention. Paper presented in the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;
# have unpopular adolescents participate in group activities together with the popular adolescents under supervision of psychologists;
# some programs focus on training on how to combine and use one's [[Cognition|cognitive]] and behavioral abilities, including social [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusche, C. A. &amp; Greenberg, M. T. (1994, 2011, 2012). The PATHS Curriculum. South Deerfield, MA: Channing-Bete Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissberg, R. P., Caplan, M., &amp; Harwood, R. L. (1991). Promoting competent young people in competence-enhancing environments: A systems-based perspective on primary prevention. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 59(6), 830-841. {{doi|10.1037/0022-006X.59.6.830}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Different types of programs have shown to have somewhat different effects: the first type seems to best improve adolescent's ability to get along with others while the second type has shown to improve adolescents' [[self-conception]]s and their acceptance by others.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L., &amp; Furman, W. (1984). The effects of social skills training and peer involvement on the social adjustment of pre-adolescents. Child Development, 55(1), 151-162. {{doi|10.2307/1129841}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples of the programs using the third approach is [http://www.channing-bete.com/prevention-programs/paths/paths.html PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies)] teaches skills needed for successfully analyzing social situations, controlling one's negative emotions, and making more [[Rationality|rational]] social decisions. It has been shown to successfully reduce behavioral problems among elementary school children.&lt;ref&gt;Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (1999). Initial impact of the Fast Track Prevention Trial for Conduct Problems, II: Classroom effects. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,'' 67, 648-657&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is difficult to prevent relational aggression from happening as often adolescents who use it are seen to be more popular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Rose 2004" /&gt;

speaking and predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] region]]
While feminist movements became prevalent in Europe and North America in the 1960s and 1970s, the women of [[Latin America]] were gathering to oppose dictatorships and civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fernandez Anderson|first=Cora|title=The Politics of Abortion in Latin America|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/07/17/the-politics-of-abortion-in-latin-america/|work=RH Reality Check}}&lt;/ref&gt; As democracy began to spread across the region, feminist movements gradually began to push for more reproductive rights.

In the 1990s, many of the groups that made up the women's movement began to evolve in order to adapt to a changing political climate. These groups focused on specific policy issues, such as [[abortion]], and were not composed exclusively of civil society actors. During this same time period, [[opposition to abortion|anti-abortion activism]] was also beginning to gain momentum. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] replaced hundreds of progressive clergy and summarily repressed discussions of reproductive issues. Groups continuing to fight for legal abortion across the region have faced a strong resistance from the [[Catholic church]] as well as the religious right in the [[United States]]. Although a majority of countries within the region are officially secular, the church continues to have an extensive influence within the region due to Latin America being the largest Catholic region in the world. The [[Christian right|religious right]] in the United States holds substantial clout over the political right in its own country, which has resulted in the United States banning federal funding for international NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pothecary|first=Sam|title=Abortion Rights in Latin America: A Tale of Varying Woes|url=http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/19272-abortion-rights-in-latin-america-a-tale-of-varying-woes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerably damaging to groups in Latin America was [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1984 [[Mexico City Policy|Global Gag Rule]] which prohibited international organizations receiving US federal funds from performing or promoting [[abortion]] as a method of [[family planning]].

Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining reproductive rights ==
During the [[Cold War]], reproductive restrictions were directed at controlling [[overpopulation]] through technocratic regulatory mechanisms and vertical population control campaigns. The United Nations International Conference on Population and Development of 1994 held in Cairo, Egypt established the first global agenda for sexual and reproductive health and rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health|url=http://www.ghwatch.org/sites/www.ghwatch.org/files/B4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement marked a paradigm shift away from a narrow approach based on delivery of services and numbers rather than well-being. It placed rights at the center of population and development and defined reproductive health as "a state of complete, physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes." This broader approach to reproductive health moved the Cairo Agenda into political and economic debates over access and rights to knowledge, resources, and appropriate services.

Thus, women and health movements in civil society and their allies in the United Nations and national bureaucracies have undertaken strong campaigns to link public health, gender equality, and development policy. By understanding reproductive rights in the broader context of human rights, governments are able to create a standard of health that ensures development.&lt;ref name=":66"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raguz|first=Maria|date=2001|title=Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Latin America|jstor=4065364|journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=5|pages=30–63|doi=10.2307/4065364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this broader understanding of reproductive health places a certain level of responsibility on the government in ensuring this aspect of health for its citizens.

This cross-cultural consensus focuses on the importance of one particular capability, that of bodily health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Promoting Women's Capabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing the many areas reproductive health has influence over serves to exemplify its importance as well as gives some understanding as to what necessary improvements need to be made to a society.

Reproductive health also encompasses knowledge production and knowledge consumption. In order to obtain reproductive rights, quality information and services must be made available to all citizens of a society.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

== Current strategies ==

=== International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) ===
The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] defined reproductive health as noted above. It also defined strategies and goals for advancing such reproductive health and rights in Latin America through what is called the [[Reproductive rights|Cairo Programme of Action]] (CPA). The CPA has three quantitative targets: (1) Reducing overall mortality, which implies an increase in life expectancy, reducing specific mortalities (2) Universal access to education, especially for girls (3) Universal access to [[reproductive health services]], including [[family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean: Review of the period 2009-2013 and lessons learned|url=http://www.eclac.cl/publicaciones/xml/2/50562/CRPDSummary.pdf|publisher=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopted by the region at the conference, some improvements have been seen since the adoption of the CPA. Reproductive rights have become recognized in the constitutions of [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Emma|author2=Anne-Emanuelle Birn |title=Sexual and Reproductive health and rights in Latin America: an analysis of trends, commitments and achievements|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2011|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean Ad Hoc Committee on Population and Development is responsible for official follow-up to the implementation of the CPA in [[Latin America]] as well as the [[Caribbean]].

=== Millennium Development Goals in Latin America ===
The [[Millennium Development Goals]] are a descriptive framework by which to monitor response to eight specific goals. They were announced in the [[Millennium Declaration]] in September 2000. Whether or not a country is on track to meeting these goals—in the case of Latin America—is tracked by the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC). One particular goal in regard to reproductive health, Goal 5, seeks to improve maternal health within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goals, targets and indicators|url=http://www.cepal.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/mdg/noticias/paginas/7/35557/P35557.xml&amp;xsl=/mdg/tpl/p18f-st.xsl&amp;base=/mdg/tpl-i/top-bottom.xsl|work=Millennium Development Goals in Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first target of Goal 5 is to reduce the [[maternal mortality]] ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. In order to assess the progress towards this goal, ECLAC monitors maternal mortality ratios and the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. The second target of Goal 5 is to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015. This target is assessed by viewing contraceptive prevalence rates, adolescent birth rates, antenatal care coverage and percentages of unmet need for family planning. In order to achieve these goals, many actions have been taken, including the growing institutionalization of deliveries and the increased number of personnel trained to provide care during childbirth and emergency obstetric care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality in Central America: The need to accelerate efforts by 2035|url=http://www.mhtf.org/tag/latin-america/|work=The Maternal Health Task Force|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429080613/http://www.mhtf.org/tag/latin-america/|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal health and mortality ==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, about 9,200 women are dying annually from pregnancy-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulczycki|first=Andrzej|title=Abortion in Latin America: Changes in Practice, Growing Conflict, and Recent Policy Developments|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=21 September 2011|volume=42|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deaths have a variety of causes that can occur as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that around 80% of all maternal deaths are a result of severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, more than 20% of women who gave birth in 2008 did not make the recommended four  antenatal visits and 13% did not deliver in a health facility.

None of the Latin American countries will reach the Millennium Development goal target specifically for maternal mortality, as well as it continues to be both a health and social challenge in Latin America. Research indicates that the numbers are disproportionately high within the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and afro-descendant populations among the very poor. For indigenous populations as well as adolescents and young people, the rate of unmet family planning need also remains high. Latin America has the second highest [[fertility rates]] among adolescents and the highest unsafe abortion rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://icpdbeyond2014.org/pages/view/4-latin-america-and-the-caribbean|work=International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 201|publisher=International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the maternal mortality rate in Latin America is relatively low compared to other regions with a rate of 80 deaths per 100,000 live births. However, if one were to break down the region's mortality rate by country, one could easily demonstrate that there exists a large disparity between affluent and poor countries. For example, in Haiti the rate was closer to 350 deaths per 100,000 live births. The disparity between wealthy and poor areas likely exists due to the differences in access to services and skilled professionals. Women in the highest income quintile have far easier access to such health services than women in the lowest income quintile. The same class-based disparity exists when analyzing the use of contraceptive  methods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Adolescent maternity and reproductive health ===
Protecting the health of adolescents is an important public health priority. Increased investment in adolescent reproductive health contributes to improving the overall status of women as well as the reduction in poverty among families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Adolescent Women in the Developing World|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Adolescents-SRH.pdf|work=Guttmacher Institute|publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent health must be contextualized within reproductive health and thus public health. Latin American government as a whole did not recognize early pregnancy in adolescents to be an issue until 1984 during the International Conference on Population in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

In Latin America, 38% of women become pregnant before the age of 20 and almost 20% of births are to teenage mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Health: A Priority to Ensure the Health and Rights of Women|url=http://www.ippfwhr.org/en/speech/maternal-health-priority-ensure-health-and-rights-women|publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year there are estimated to be 1.2 million unintended pregnancies among adolescent women living in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although overall fertility rates have largely dropped within the region, adolescent maternity is following an opposite trend. The Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean reports that as of 2011, in [[Nicaragua]] approximately 2 in 10 women between the ages of 15 and 19 is a mother. In places such as [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Peru]] the percentage is close to 12% while in [[Belize]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]] reach percentages close to 15%. Inequality is also present in the issue of adolescent maternity, with pregnancy rates being three to five times higher among poor adolescents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} While an overall universal trend towards earlier average age of menstruation can be seen, the mean age of marriage has declined. This implies that adolescents who are coerced into marriage are unprotected in terms of reproductive rights for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Population Fund|UN Population Fund]], education and access to information and services young people need in order to make responsible decisions remains insufficient. The importance of education is exemplified by how girls in Latin America who have completed only up to primary education or less have a higher probability of adolescent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt; Further, many young girls are dying because their bodies cannot support pregnancies. The same fund reports that the risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery for girls aged 15 to 19 is double the rate for women in their 20s, and five times as high for girls under 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgerton|first=Anna|author2=Ina Sotirova |title=Sex and the Barrio: A Clash of Faith in Latin America|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Winter 2011/2012 Faith Issue|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2011/sex-and-the-barrio}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research reveals that there are several major barriers that young people face to accessing [[contraception]], primarily with acquiring services. For example, facilities are frequently in areas inaccessible to young individuals. Due to a lack of information, adolescents often incorrectly use or do not use contraceptives at all.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt; For the purpose of privacy from their communities and families, young persons often seek services from facilities not located directly in their own neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moya|first=Cecilia|title=Improving Youth's Access to Contraception in Latin America|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/517?task=view|work=Advocates for Youth|publisher=Advocates for Youth}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are also legal barriers preventing youth's access. Many policies limit or prohibit confidential services for youths.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

There is also a swath of data that is not collected by hospitals on abortions that are particularly "clandestine" / "backstreet". Studies have shown that in several Latin American countries, young single women are at a high risk for abortion which is not reflected by the amount of married, older women who were hospitalized for abortions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strickler|first=Jennifer, et al|date=2001|title=Clandestine Abortion in Latin America: A Clinic Profile|jstor=2673803|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|volume=27|pages=34–36|doi=10.2307/2673803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from a lack of information, young people who seek contraception are often denied by health workers acting out of their own moral convictions. It is clear that religious attitudes are very much present in society, which often deters young persons from seeking reproductive services and contraception.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Family Planning ==

=== Contraceptives ===

Use of modern contraceptives has increased to 62.5% (CITE: Population action) giving the region as a whole the highest contraceptive prevalence rate in the developing world. The increased uptake of sexual and reproductive health and family planning services has resulted in a marked drop in total [[fertility]] rates from approximately 4.6 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.5 in 2013. 
In Latin America, multiple court decisions have granted personhood to fertilized eggs. These court decisions have been responsible for the extreme restrictions on access to emergency contraception within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to EC in Latin America Takes Center Stage at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|url=http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/access-to-EC-in-Latin-America-at-IACHR|work=Center For Reproductive Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The legal status of [[oral contraception]] in Latin America varies by country. In 2009 [[Honduras]] banned the free distribution and sale of emergency contraceptives That same year, the [[Constitutional Court of Peru]] ordered the [[Ministry of Health (Peru)|Health Ministry]] to refrain from distributing [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptives]] to the public sector. In [[Costa Rica]], where emergency contraceptives are not blatantly prohibited, the popular emergency contraceptive levonorgestrel is not registered as a product, which impedes access to the drug from within the public health system as well as the private market.  
Although the remaining countries in the region allow for the free distribution of emergency contraceptives, they do not have uniform regulations. In [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]], the right to have access to emergency contraceptives is recognized. In [[Nicaragua]] and [[Bolivia]], the protocols of their respective health ministries are essentially law. In Argentina and Brazil, the distribution of emergency contraceptives is not legally recognized except in protocols and informative guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hevia|first=Martin|title=The legal status of emergency contraception in Latin America|journal=International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics|year=2012|pages=87–90|url=http://www.ossyr.org.ar/pdf/bibliografia/190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===
{{See|Category:Abortion by country}}Abortion is a highly controversial aspect of reproductive rights. While every country in Latin America has differing laws and regulations regarding abortion, the general sentiment is that of disapproval. Abortions in Latin America have had a history of being unsafe and illegal (especially for poor women), with recent improvements in both of those areas.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulczycki|first=A|date=2011|title=Abortion in Latin America: Changes in Practice, Growing Conflict, and Recent Policy Developments.|url=|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume=42|pages=199–220|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2011.00282.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these improvements can be attributed to modern contraception, emergency care, as well as education. Similarly, advocacy and national conflict has grown surrounding abortion rights in Latin America. The region has seen a steady increase of feminist abortion activists, despite religion making the issue taboo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Even when legislation has become more lenient (as has been the case recently with Mexico City and Chile), women often face institutional barriers to gaining access to abortions. When it comes to reporting data on abortions in Latin America, estimated abortion levels are often heterogeneous and highly variable due to legal frameworks and social stigmas.

According to the World Health Organization, in 2008, approximately "4.2 million abortions were conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean, almost three-fourths of them in South America. Virtually all these procedures were illegal and many were unsafe."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2011, the number of [[unsafe abortion]]s in Latin America rose to 4.2 million annually. Unsafe abortions account for a large proportion of [[maternal death]]s. For example, in [[Argentina]] [[unsafe abortions]] account for 31% of the maternal mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caivano|first=Joan|author2=Jane Marcus-Delgado|title=Time for Change: Reproductive rights in Latin America in the 21st Century|journal=Reproductive Laws for the 21st Century Papers|date=May 2012|url=http://centerwomenpolicy.org/programs/health/statepolicy/documents/REPRO_Time_for_Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307200146/http://www.centerwomenpolicy.org/programs/health/statepolicy/documents/REPRO_Time_for_Change.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America abortion is:&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*completely prohibited: El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua 
*allowed only to save the mother's life: Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Venezuela,
*allowed only to save the mother's life and in case of rape: Brazil 
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health: Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador (and rape of [[disabled]] woman)
*allowed only to save the mother's life and in case of rape or fetal malformation: Chile (since 2017), Panama
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health, and in case of rape: Argentina, Bolivia
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health, and in case of rape, or fetal malformation: Colombia
*allowed on request: Cuba, Uruguay, Mexico City (in Mexico law varies by state)

Only two countries within Latin America allow for legal abortion without restriction. However, these countries are home to less than 5% of women between the ages of 15-44. According to a report released by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], 95% of abortions in Latin America are unsafe. Nearly one million women are hospitalized each year because of complications from unsafe abortion. Overall, Latin American rates of death related to illegal abortions rank among the highest in the world.

Strict abortion laws are accompanied by strict punishments. In El Salvador, for example, a woman can be jailed for up to 40 years for aborting while in Mexico, she could be jailed for up to 50 years. These punishments do not take into consideration the cause of the pregnancy, due to the fact that many of the imprisoned women were raped or had involuntary abortions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalhealthpolicies.org/the-right-to-health-and-safe-abortion-in-latin-america-still-a-long-way-to-go/|title=The right to health and safe abortion in Latin America: still a long way to go|date=2017-09-29|work=IHP|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International legislations also have an effect on abortion rights in Latin America. When U.S. President Donald Trump reinstated the Global Gag Rule on January 23, 2017, he prohibited all U.S. federal money from funding international organizations such as NGOs that "perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theglobalamericans.org/2017/03/global-gag-rule-womens-health-risk-latin-america/|title=The global gag rule: Women’s health at risk in Latin America?|work=Global Americans|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that abortion regulations are already extremely strict in Latin America, this legislation disproportionately affects Latin American organizations that try to provide abortion services to women either legally, or illegally.

=== Comprehensive Sexual Education ===

In 2012 a report presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) found that access to information remains a significant roadblock to sexual and reproductive health, particularly in Latin America.(CITE HR BRIEF) The report noted that even when a state has a comprehensive legal framework guaranteeing access to information, in practice the individual's health is endangered by uninformed decisions made by individuals and policymakers based on inadequate information regarding sexual and reproductive health. In 2011, IACHR issued a report on access to information on reproductive health and found that the situation is compounded when women are poor, indigenous, of African descent, live in a rural area, or are a migrant.

In 2008, the region adopted "Miniseria Declaration, 'Prevention through Education,'" in response to a lack of comprehensive sexuality education. While there have been some setbacks and delays regarding implementation, there have also been key improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Sex Education Successes in Latin America|url=http://www.ippfwhr.org/en/blog/five-sex-education-successes-latin-america|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the ministries of health and education of Guatemala reaffirmed their commitment to working together in order to ensure the goals of the Ministerial Declaration are the met. In addition, the government of Guatemala is implementing a comprehensive sexuality education program for young people in nine regions of the country. Actions aimed at promoted comprehensive sexual education can be seen in multiple areas of the region, demonstrating that leaders are indeed dedicated to making such improvements. Earlier in 2012, Costa Rica adopted a national sexuality program for the first time in history. The curriculum approaches human sexuality in a comprehensive way; it includes lessons on human rights, gender equality, power, interpersonal communication, respect for diversity and pleasure. Also making a critical first step that year was El Salvador with its General Youth Act, legislation which recognizes and guarantees the right of young persons to receive comprehensive sex education. Implementation will be an ongoing challenge, however, recognition is important step toward meeting the needs of youth.

==Religion in Latin America==
{{See|Religion in Latin America|Catholic Church in Latin America}}
Religion in Latin America is characterized by the predominance of [[Roman Catholicism]], although there is also increasing [[Protestantism|Protestant]] influence (especially in Central America and Brazil) as well as by the presence of other world religions. Catholicism was introduced in Latin America with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and continued through the independence movements of the Spanish-American colonies up to the present day. Critics of the restrictive abortion laws of Latin America argue that this situation is created by the strong influence of  the Catholic church in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/abortion-rights-latin-america&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman's life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Influence ==
While many of Latin America's reforms in regards to reproductive rights have happened internally, the broader international community plays an important role as well. The [[Center for Reproductive Rights]], for example, has used international litigation as a way to reinforce national legislation surrounding reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabal, et al.|first=Louisa|date=2003|title=What Role Can International Litigation Play in the Promotion and Advancement of Reproductive Rights in Latin America?|jstor=4065417|journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=7|pages=50–88|doi=10.2307/4065417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal policy plays an important role in establishing a standard of reproductive rights internationally as well as within Latin America itself. This implies that over time, reproductive rights will be integrated into a broader framework of human rights.

The '''Rescorla–Wagner model''' ("'''R-W'''") is a model of [[classical conditioning]], in which learning is conceptualized in terms of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Rescorla2.htm|title=The Rescorla-Wagner Model of Classical Conditioning|last=Abbott|first=Bruce|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong CS-US association means, essentially, that the CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the [[blocking effect]]. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazy|first=Thomas E.|last2=Frank|first2=Michael J.|last3=O’Reilly|first3=Randall C.|date=2010-04-01|title=Neural Mechanisms Supporting Acquired Phasic Dopamine Responses in Learning: An Integrative Synthesis|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=34|issue=5|pages=701–720|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.11.019|issn=0149-7634|pmc=2839018|pmid=19944716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rescorla–Wagner model was created by [[Robert A. Rescorla]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Allan R. Wagner]] of [[Yale University]] in 1972.

==Basic assumptions of the model==
#The change in the association between a CS and a US that occurs when the two are paired depends on how strongly the US is predicted on that trial - that is, informally, how "surprised" the organism is by the US. The amount of this "surprise" depends on the summed associative strength of all cues present during that trial. In contrast, previous models derived the change in associative strength from the current value of the CS alone.
#The associative strength of a CS is represented by a single number. The association is excitatory if the number is positive, inhibitory if it is negative. 
#The associative strength of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is expressed directly by the behavior it elicits/inhibits. 
#The [[Incentive salience|salience]] of a CS (alpha in the equation) and the strength of the US (beta) are constants and do not change during training.
#Only the current associative strength of a cue determines its effect on behavior and the amount of learning it supports. It does not matter how that strength value was arrived at, whether by simple conditioning, reconditioning, or otherwise.
 
The first two assumptions were new in the Rescorla–Wagner model. The last three assumptions were present in previous models and are less crucial to the R-W model's novel predictions.

==Equation==
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V^{n+1}_X = \alpha_X \beta (\lambda - V_{tot})&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;V^{n+1}_X = V^n_X + \Delta V^{n+1}_X&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the strength, on a single trial, of the association between the CS labelled "X" and the US
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the salience of X (bounded by 0 and 1)
* &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the rate parameter for the US (bounded by 0 and 1), sometimes called its [[association value]]
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum conditioning possible for the US
* &lt;math&gt;V_X&lt;/math&gt; is the current associative strength of X
* &lt;math&gt;V_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the total associative strength of all stimuli present, that is, X plus any others
&lt;ref name="Assessment of model" /&gt;

==The revised RW model by Van Hamme and Wasserman (1994)==
Van Hamme and Wasserman have extended the original Rescorla–Wagner (RW) model and introduced a new factor in their revised RW model in 1994:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Hamme, L.J. |author2=Wasserman, E.A. |year=1994 |title=Cue competition in causality judgements: The role of nonpresentation of compound stimulus elements |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=25 |pages=127–151 |url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/pdfs/causality/VanHammeWasserman04.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065145/http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/pdfs/causality/VanHammeWasserman04.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that not only conditioned stimuli physically present on a given trial can undergo changes in their associative strength, the associative value of a CS can also be altered by a within-compound-association with a CS present on that trial. A within-compound-association is established if two CSs are presented together during training (compound stimulus). If one of the two component CSs is subsequently presented alone, then it is assumed to activate a representation of the other (previously paired) CS as well. Van Hamme and Wasserman propose that stimuli indirectly activated through within-compound-associations have a negative learning parameter—thus phenomena of retrospective reevaluation can be explained.

Consider the following example, an experimental paradigm called "backward blocking," indicative of retrospective revaluation, where AB is the compound stimulus A+B:
* Phase 1: AB–US 
* Phase 2: A–US

Test trials: Group 1, which received both Phase 1- and 2-trials, elicits a weaker conditioned response (CR) to B compared to the Control group, which only received Phase 1-trials.

The original RW model cannot account for this effect. But the revised model can: In Phase 2, stimulus B is indirectly activated through within-compound-association with A. But instead of a positive learning parameter (usually called alpha) when physically present, during Phase 2, B has a negative learning parameter. Thus during the second phase, B's associative strength declines whereas A's value increases because of its positive learning parameter.

Thus, the revised RW model can explain why the CR elicited by B after backward blocking training is weaker compared with AB-only conditioning.

==Some failures of the RW model==
;Spontaneous recovery from extinction and recovery from extinction caused by reminder treatments (reinstatement)
:It is a well-established observation that a time-out interval after completion of extinction results in partial recovery from extinction, i.e., the previously extinguished reaction or response recurs—but usually at a lower level than before extinction training. Reinstatement refers to the phenomenon that exposure to the US from training alone after completion of extinction results in partial recovery from extinction. The RW model can't account for those phenomena.

;Extinction of a previously conditioned inhibitor
:The RW model predicts that repeated presentation of a conditioned inhibitor alone (a CS with negative associative strength) results in extinction of this stimulus (a decline of its negative associative value). This is a false prediction. Contrarily, experiments show the repeated presentation of a conditioned inhibitor alone even increases its inhibitory potential

;Facilitated [[reacquisition]] after extinction
:One of the assumptions of the model is that the history of conditioning of a CS does not have any influences on its present status—only its current associative value is important. Contrary to this assumption, many experiments{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} show that stimuli that were first conditioned and then extinguished are more easily reconditioned (i.e., fewer trials are necessary for conditioning).

;The exclusiveness of excitation and inhibition
:The RW model also assumes that [[wikt:excite|excitation]] and [[:wikt:inhibition|inhibition]] are opponent features. A stimulus can either have excitatory potential (a positive associative strength) or inhibitory potential (a negative associative strength), but not both. By contrast it is sometimes observed, that stimuli can have both qualities. One example is [[backward conditioning|backward excitatory conditioning]] in which a CS is backwardly paired with a US (US–CS instead of CS–US). This usually makes the CS become a conditioned excitor. The stimulus also has inhibitory features which can be proven by the retardation of acquisition test. This test is used to assess the inhibitory potential of a stimulus since it is observed that excitatory conditioning with a previously conditioned inhibitor is retarded. The backwardly conditioned stimulus passes this test and thus seems to have both excitatory and inhibitory features.

;Pairing a novel stimulus with a conditioned inhibitor
:A conditioned inhibitor is assumed to have a negative associative value. By presenting an inhibitor with a novel stimulus (i.e., its associative strength is zero), the model predicts that the novel cue should become a conditioned excitor. This is not the case in experimental situations. The predictions of the model stem from its basic term (lambda-V). Since the summed associative strength of all stimuli (V) present on the trial is negative (zero + inhibitory potential) and lambda is zero (no US present), the resulting change in the associative strength is positive, thus making the novel cue a conditioned excitor.

;CS-preexposure effect
:The CS-[[preexposure]] effect (also called [[latent inhibition]]) is the well-established observation that conditioning after exposure to the stimulus later used as the CS in conditioning is retarded. The RW model doesn't predict any effect of presenting a novel stimulus without a US.

;Higher-order conditioning
:In [[higher-order conditioning]] a previously conditioned CS is paired with a novel cue (i.e., first CS1–US then CS2–CS1). This usually makes the novel cue CS2 elicit similar reactions to the CS1. The model cannot account for this phenomenon since during CS2–CS1 trials, no US is present. But by allowing CS1 to act similarly to a US, one can reconcile the model with this effect.

;Sensory preconditioning
:[[Sensory preconditioning]] refers to first pairing two novel cues (CS1–CS2) and then pairing one of them with a US (CS2–US). This turns both CS1 and CS2 into conditioned excitors. The RW model cannot explain this, since during the CS1–CS2-phase both stimuli have an associative value of zero and lambda is also zero (no US present) which results in no change in the associative strength of the stimuli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4401">'''Ronald Campbell Macfie''' (1867–1931) was a Scottish [[medical doctor]], [[poet]] and science writer specialising in [[eugenics]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=T. Bose|author2=R. N. Colbeck|title=A Bookman's Catalogue Vol. 2 M-End: The Norman Colbeck Collection of Nineteenth-Century and Edwardian Poetry and Belles Lettres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQetGZ2D3YYC&amp;pg=PA508|date=1 November 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4481-9|pages=508–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Congregational Quarterly'', Volume 13, [[Congregational Union of England and Wales]], 1 Jan 1935, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was a Scottish physician and writer. He had qualified in medicine in Aberdeen in 1897 and specialised in the treatment of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Lindsay ''Flora Thompson: The Story of the Lark Rise Writer'' Hale, 30 Apr 1990, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a Liberal Member of [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1868|British Parliament]] mentioned in [[Arthur St. John Adcock#The Bookman Treasury of Living Poets (4th edition 1931)|''The Bookman Treasury of Living Poets'' (4th edition 1931)]] as a contributor to such works as ''Fairy Tales for Old and Young (1909), and The [[Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry]] (1940)''. Among his works are "Man’s Record in the Rocks" (''[[My Magazine]]'', May 1921) '' The Art of Keeping Well'' Cassell &amp; Co. 1918/[[The Vegetarian Society]] and ''Evolutionary Consequences of War'' (cited below).

Campbell Macfie suggested that male war deaths (during [[World War I]]) would create a surplus of fertile women, thus reducing the overall birthrate whilst the surviving men would select partners from a wide range of 'surplus' females according to eugenically (sexually) attractive characteristics. He averred that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Nature has wisely arranged that men should be attracted (to women) by characteristics that imply a superior capacity for motherhood... (thus)...every war will do something to set up evolutionary tendencies opposite to its own, brutal, truculent, anti-social spirit.}}

==Evolution==

Macfie was a critic of [[Darwinism]] and developed his own non-Darwinian evolution theory which was a form of [[neovitalism]]. He believed that chance played no role in evolution and that evolution was directed; he discussed these views in his book ''Heredity, Evolution, and Vitalism'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]] ''Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain'' 2001, pp. 385-386&lt;/ref&gt; Macfie was also a [[panpsychist]] as he believed mind was to be found in all matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Aberdeen University Review'', Volume 2 University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen University Alumnus Association, 1915, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; MacFie had dedicated one of his books and a poem to the naturalist [[J. Arthur Thomson]] in honor of his efforts to promote a neovitalist biology.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler ''Science for all: the popularization of science in early twentieth-century Britain'' 2009, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1184">The '''Segre classification''' is an algebraic classification of rank two [[symmetric tensor]]s. The resulting types are then known as '''Segre types'''. It is most commonly applied to the [[energy-momentum tensor]] (or the [[Ricci tensor]]) and primarily finds application in the classification of [[exact solutions in general relativity]].

'''Self-help''' or '''self-improvement''' is a self-guided improvement&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;''APA Dictionary of Physicology'', 1st ed., Gary R. VandenBos, ed., Washington: American Psychological Association, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial [[psychology|psychological]] basis.  Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, [[leadership|leader]]s. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and [[Twelve-step program|Twelve-Step]] culture, such as [[Recovery model|recovery]], [[dysfunctional families]], and [[codependency]] have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.&lt;ref&gt;Micki McGee. ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-help often utilizes publicly available information or [[support groups]], on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; From early examples in self-driven legal practice&lt;ref name="Salerno 2005"&gt;Steve Salerno (2005) ''Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless'', {{ISBN|1-4000-5409-5}} pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to [[education]], [[business]], [[psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]], commonly distributed through the popular genre of [[self-help book]]s. According to the ''APA Dictionary of Psychology'', potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

Groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and [[caregiver]]s. As well as featuring long-time members sharing [[experience]]s, these health groups can become [[support group]]s and clearing-houses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying about health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer support.

==History==
Within [[classical antiquity]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' "opens with moral remonstrances, hammered home in every way that Hesiod can think of."&lt;ref&gt;
John Boardman et al eds., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1991), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] offered ethical advice "on the notion of ''eudaimonia''—of well-being, welfare, flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of [[mirror-of-princes writing]]s, which has a long history in [[Greco-Roman]] and Western [[Renaissance]] literature, represents a secular cognate of Biblical wisdom-literature. [[Proverb]]s from many periods, collected and uncollected, embody traditional moral and practical advice of diverse cultures.

The hyphenated [[English compound|compound]] word "self-help" often appeared in the 1800s in a legal context, referring to the doctrine that a party in a dispute has the right to use lawful means on their own initiative to remedy a wrong.&lt;ref&gt;
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989) traces legal usage back to at least 1875; whereas it detects "self-help" as a moral virtue as early as 1831 in [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, [[George Combe]]'s "''Constitution''" [1828], in the way that it advocated [[personal responsibility]] and the possibility of naturally sanctioned self-improvement through education or proper self-control, largely inaugurated the self-help movement;"&lt;ref&gt;John Van Wyhe, ''Phrenology and the Origins of Victorian Scientific Naturalism'' (2004) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2015}} In 1841, an essay by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], entitled [[Compensation (essay)|Compensation]], was published suggesting "every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults" and "acquire habits of ''self-help''" as "our strength grows out of our weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Compensation'' (1841) p. 22 [http://www.emersoncentral.com/compensation.htm Essays]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Smiles]] (1812–1904) published the first self-consciously personal-development "self-help" book—entitled ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]''—in 1859. Its opening sentence: "Heaven helps those who help themselves", provides a variation of "God helps them that help themselves", the oft-quoted [[maxim (saying)|maxim]] that had also appeared previously in [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' (1733–1758). In the 20th century, "[[Dale Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s remarkable success as a self-help author"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Starker, ''Oracle at the Supermarket'' (2002) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; further developed the genre with ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' in 1936. Having failed in several careers, Carnegie became fascinated with success and its link to [[self-confidence]], and his books have since sold over 50 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, William J. (2003). ''Business Leaders &amp; Success: 55 Top Business Leaders &amp; How They Achieved Greatness''. [[McGraw-Hill Professional]]. pp. 35–36. {{ISBN|0-07-142680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 1902, [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] published ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'', which proceeds from the conviction that "a man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts." Noble thoughts, the book maintains, make for a noble person, whilst lowly thoughts make for a miserable person; and [[Napoleon Hill]]'s ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937) described the use of repeated [[Optimism|positive thought]]s to attract happiness and wealth by tapping into an "[[Infinity|Infinite]] Intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;Starker, Steven (2002). ''Oracle at the Supermarket: The American Preoccupation With Self-Help Books''. Transaction Publishers. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-7658-0964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th century===

In the final third of the 20th century, "the tremendous growth in self-help publishing...in self-improvement culture"&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; really took off—something which must be linked to [[postmodernism]] itself—to the way "postmodern subjectivity constructs self-reflexive subjects-in-process."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Deeds Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably at least, "in the literatures of self-improvement...that crisis of subjecthood is not articulated but enacted—demonstrated in ever-expanding self-help book sales."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative turn of the [[neoliberal]] decades also meant a decline in traditional political activism, and increasing "social isolation; Twelve-Step recovery groups were one context in which individuals sought a sense of community...yet another symptom of the psychologizing of the personal"&lt;ref&gt;
Mcgee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; to more radical critics. Indeed, "some social theorist{{sic}} have argued that the late-20th century preoccupation with the self serves as a tool of social control: soothing political unrest...[for] one's own pursuit of self-invention."'&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 22–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The market==
Within the context of the market, group and corporate attempts to aid the "seeker" have moved into the "self-help" marketplace, with [[Large Group Awareness Training]]s, LGATs&lt;ref&gt;

and [[psychotherapy]] systems represented. These offer more-or-less prepackaged solutions to instruct people seeking their own individual betterment,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} just as "the literature of self-improvement directs the reader to familiar frameworks...what the French ''[[fin de siècle]]'' social theorist [[Gabriel Tarde]] called 'the grooves of borrowed thought'."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, pp. 160–2&lt;/ref&gt;

A subgenre of self-help book series also exists: such as the [[...for Dummies|''for Dummies'' guides]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnny Ward's alternative guide to finding the Grand National winner |url=https://www.racinguk.com/news/johnny-ward-s-alternative-guide-to-finding-the-grand-national-winner |website=Racing UK |publisher=Racing UK |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;and ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]]''—compare [[how-to book]]s.

=== Statistics ===
At the start of the 21st century, "the self-improvement industry, inclusive of books, seminars, audio and video products, and personal coaching, [was] said to constitute a 2.48-billion dollars-a-year industry"&lt;ref&gt;
Micki McGee, ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 11
&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States alone. By 2006, research firm Marketdata estimated the "self-improvement" market in the U.S. as worth more than $9 billion—including [[infomercial]]s, [[mail-order catalog]]s, [[holistic]] institutes, books, [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]]s, [[motivational speaker|motivation-speaker]] seminars, the [[personal coaching]] market, [[weight loss|weight-loss]] and [[stress management|stress-management]] programs. Marketdata projected that the total market size would grow to over $11 billion by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

===Self-help and professional service delivery===
Self-help and mutual-help are very different from—though they may complement—service delivery by professionals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lloyd |first1=R |title=Modeling community-based, self-help mental health rehabilitation . |journal=Australasian Psychiatry : Bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists |volume=15 Suppl 1 |pages=S99–103 |pmid=18027146 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10398560701701296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; note for example the interface between local self-help and International Aid's service delivery model.

Conflicts can and do arise on that interface, however, with some professionals considering that "the twelve-step approach encourages a kind of contemporary version of 19th-century amateurism or enthusiasm in which self-examination and very general social observations are enough to draw rather large conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lennard J. Davis|title=Obsession: A History|location=London|year=2008|pages=171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z5ATMl1uCCcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lennard+J.+Davis,+Obsession:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=Lennard%20J.%20Davis%2C%20Obsession%3A%20A%20History&amp;f=false|isbn=9780226137797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The rise of self-help culture has inevitably led to boundary disputes with other approaches and disciplines. Some would object to their classification as "self-help" literature, as with "[[Deborah Tannen]]'s denial of the self-help role of her books" so as to maintain her academic credibility, aware of the danger that "writing a book that becomes a popular success...all but ensures that one's work will lose its long-term legitimacy."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 195 and 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Placebo]] effects can never be wholly discounted. Thus careful studies of "the power of subliminal self-help tapes...showed that their content had no real effect...But that's not what the participants thought."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith/Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (Hove 2007) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; "If they thought they'd listened to a self-esteem tape (even though half the labels were wrong), they felt that their self-esteem had gone up. No wonder people keep buying subliminal tape: even though the tapes don't work, people think they do."&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; One might then see much of the self-help industry as part of the "skin trades. People need haircuts, massage, dentistry, wigs and glasses, sociology and surgery, as well as love and advice."&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;—a skin trade, "not a profession and a science"&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Its practitioners would thus be functioning as "part of the personal service industry rather than as mental health professionals."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; While "there is no proof that twelve-step programs 'are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems',"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bakalar 2006, in Davis, p. 178-9&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time it is clear that "there is something about 'groupishness' itself which is curative."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis''(Penguin 1976) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example "smoking increases mortality risk by a factor of just 1.6, while social isolation does so by a factor of 2.0...suggest[ing] an added value to self-help groups such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] as surrogate communities."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of positive psychologists|Some psychologists]] advocate a [[positive psychology]], and explicitly embrace an empirical self-help philosophy; "the role of positive psychology is to become a bridge between the ivory tower and the main street—between the rigor of academe and the fun of the self-help movement."&lt;ref&gt;Tal Ben-Shachar, "Giving Positive Psychology Away" in C. R. Snyder et al, ''Positive Psychology'' (Sage 2010) p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to refine the self-improvement field by way of an intentional increase in scientifically sound research and well-engineered models. The division of focus and methodologies has produced several subfields, in particular: general positive psychology, focusing primarily on the study of psychological phenomenon and effects; and [[personal effectiveness]], focusing primarily on analysis, design and implementation of qualitative personal growth. This includes the intentional training of new patterns of thought and feeling. As business strategy communicator [[Don Tapscott]] puts it, "The design industry is something done to us. I'm proposing we each become designers. But I suppose 'I love the way she thinks' could take on new meaning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_7.html Edge.org question center: Scientific concepts and cognitive toolkits, page 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both self-talk, the propensity to engage in verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought, and social support can be used as instruments of self-improvement, often by empowering, action-promoting messages. Psychologists have designed series of experiments that are intended to shed light into how self-talk can result in self-improvement. In general, research has shown that people prefer to use second person pronouns over first person pronouns when engaging in self-talk to achieve goals, regulate one’s own behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance.&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, K. L., Hardy, J., &amp; Hall, C. G. (2001). A description of self-talk in exercise. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 2, 233–247&lt;/ref&gt; If self-talk has the expected effect, then writing about personal problems using language from their friends’ perspective should result in greater amount of motivational and emotional benefits comparing to using language from their own perspective. When you need to finish a difficult task and you are not willing to do something to finish this task, trying to write a few sentence or goals imaging what your friends have told you gives you more motivational resources comparing to you write to yourself. Research done by Ireland and others have revealed that, as expected, when people are writing using many physical and mental words or even typing a standard prompt with these kinds of words, adopting a friend’s perspective while freely writing about a personal challenge can help increase people’s intention to improve self-control by promoting the positivity of emotions such as pride and satisfaction, which can motivate people to reach their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland et al. (2014). A Friend to Myself: Thinking of a Friend in Self-Talk Strengthens Intentions to Improve Self-Control. Manuscript under review.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of self-talk goes beyond the scope of self-improvement for performing certain activities, self-talk as a linguistic form of self-help also plays a very important role in regulating people’s emotions under social stress. First of all, people using non-first-person language tend to exhibit higher level of visual self-distancing during the process of introspection, indicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name may result in enhanced self-distancing.&lt;ref&gt;Mischowski, D., Kross, E., &amp; Bushman, B. (2012). Flies on the wall are less aggressive: The effect of self-distancing on aggressive affect, cognition, and behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, 1187–1191. doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kross, E. 2014"&gt;Kross, E., Bruehlman-Senecal, E., Park, J., Burson, A., Dougherty, A., Shablack, H., &amp; Ayduk, O. (2014). Self-talk as a regulatory mechanism: How you do it matters. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 106(2), 304&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, this specific form of self-help also has been found can enhance people’s ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in more challenging and less threatening terms. Additionally, these self-help behaviors also demonstrate noticeable self-regulatory effects through the process of social interactions, regardless of their dispositional vulnerability to social anxiety.&lt;ref name="Kross, E. 2014"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005 Steve Salerno portrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym ''SHAM: the Self-Help and Actualization Movement''—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals, but also as socially harmful.&lt;ref name="Salerno 2005"/&gt; "Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back 'whether the program worked for them or not'."&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Kunkel, ''Instant Appeal'' (2009) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Others similarly point out that with [[self-help books]] "supply increases the demand... The more people read them, the more they think they need them... more like an addiction than an alliance."&lt;ref&gt;R. J. McAllister, ''Emotion: Mystery or Madness?'' (2007) pp. 156–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-help writers have been described as working "in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the narrativized.... although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of moralizing."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] in his book ''God is My Broker'' asserts: "The only way to get rich from a self-help book is to write one".&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=C|title=''God Is My Broker'', ''A Monk-Tycoon Reveals the 7 1/2 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth''|year=1998|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-06-097761-0|pages=Page 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Gerald M. Rosen reported that people do not gain as much from reading self-help material as people would from the same material received in therapy. In general, he was critical of proliferation of self-help books.&lt;ref&gt;G. Rosen, "Self-help treatment books and the commercialization of psychotherapy", ''American Psychologist'', vol. 42, no. 1, 1987, 46-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
[[Kathryn Schulz]] suggests that "the underlying theory of the self-help industry is contradicted by the self-help industry’s existence".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies and fictional analogies===
The self-help world has become the target of [[parody|parodies]]. [[Walker Percy]]'s odd genre-busting ''[[Lost in the Cosmos]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book''. New York: Farrar, Straus, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "a parody of self-help books, a philosophy textbook, and a collection of short stories, quizzes, diagrams, thought experiments, mathematical formulas, made-up dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Walker-Percys-Weirdest-Book/23835/ Walker Percy's Weirdest Book]&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2006 book ''Secrets of The Superoptimist'', authors W.R. Morton and Nathanel Whitten revealed the concept of "superoptimism" as a humorous antidote to the overblown self-help book category.  In his comedy special ''[[Complaints and Grievances]]'' (2001), [[George Carlin]] observes that there is "no such thing" as self-help: anyone looking for help from someone else does not technically get "self" help; and one who accomplishes something without help, did not need help to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s semi-satiric dystopia ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'', university literary studies have declined to the point that the protagonist, Snowman, is instructed to write his thesis on self-help books as literature; more revealing of the authors and of the society that produced them than genuinely helpful.

'''Shop-ins''' were a form of public protest used briefly in 1964 as part of the [[Civil rights movement]]. 

Demonstrators would enter a store posing as customers, pile a basket or trolley high with groceries, take them through the checkout and then refuse to pay, leaving the goods piled at the checkout.&lt;ref name="Sarasota"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SrgeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8osEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7344,3644577&amp;dq=shop-ins&amp;hl=en ''Sarasota Journal: Shop-Ins Newest Weapon In Use By Demonstrators'', February 28th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic was used primarily by the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] to protest against [[Lucky Stores]] hiring policies.&lt;ref name=Sarasota/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9xIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v-gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5721,3791531&amp;dq=shop-ins&amp;hl=en ''The Spokesman-Review: CORE goes shopping'' February 26th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Research unit, Wharton School of Finance and Commerce; ''Report: The Racial policies of American industry'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972, {{ISBN|9780812290691}}, p118&lt;/ref&gt; Their 1964 protest ended after a meeting between CORE members and Lucky Stores' representatives, chaired by San Francisco mayor [[John F. Shelley|John Shelley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LrAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7004,4370783&amp;dq=shop-ins&amp;hl=en ''Lodi News-Sentinel: Brown Rips Into Recent "Shop-Ins"'', March 2nd 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

describes '''software entropy''' as follows:

:The [[second law of thermodynamics]], in principle, states that a [[closed system]]'s [[randomness|disorder]] cannot be reduced, it can only remain unchanged or increase. A measure of this disorder is [[entropy]]. This law also seems plausible for [[software system]]s; as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. This is known as '''software entropy'''.

:Within [[software development]], there are similar theories; see Lehman (1985),&lt;ref&gt;

{{Redirect|New species|newly evolved species|speciation}}
A '''species description''' is a formal description of a newly discovered [[species]], usually in the form of a [[scientific paper]].  Its purpose is to give a clear description of a new species of [[organism]] and explain how it differs from species which have been described previously or are related. The species description often contains photographs or other illustrations of the [[type (biology)|type material]] and states in which museums it has been deposited. The publication in which the species is described gives the new species a formal [[scientific name]]. Some 1.9 million species have been identified and described, out of some 8.7 million that may actually exist.&lt;ref name=plos&gt;{{cite journal | author= Mora, C.| title=How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?|journal=[[PLoS Biology]]|date=August 23, 2011|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127 |pmid=21886479 |pmc=3160336 |volume=9 |pages=e1001127|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions more have become [[extinction|extinct]].

== Naming process ==
A name of a new species becomes [[Validly published name|valid]] ([[Available name|available]] in zoological terminology) with the date of publication of its formal scientific description. Once the scientist has performed the necessary research to determine that the discovered organism represents a new species, the scientific results are summarized in a scientific manuscript, either as part of a book, or as a paper to be submitted to a scientific journal.

A scientific species description must fulfill several formal criteria specified by the [[nomenclature codes]], e.g. selection of at least one [[Type (biology)|type specimen]]. These criteria are intended to ensure that the species name is clear and unambiguous, for example, the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) states that "Authors should exercise reasonable care and consideration in forming new names to ensure that they are chosen with their subsequent users in mind and that, as far as possible, they are appropriate, compact, euphonious, memorable, and do not cause offence."&lt;ref name="ICZNRec25C"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Recommendation 25C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species names are written in the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but many species names are based on words from other languages, Latinized.

Once the manuscript has been accepted for publication,&lt;ref name="ICZNexampleabstract"&gt;One example of an abstract of an article naming a new species can be found at {{cite journal|last1=Wellner|first1=S.|last2=Lodders|first2=N.|last3=Kampfer|first3=P.|title=Methylobacterium cerastii sp. nov., isolated from the leaf surface of Cerastium holosteoides|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|date=13 June 2011|volume=62|issue=Pt 4|pages=917–924|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.030767-0|url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415195732/http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new species name is officially created.

Once a species name has been assigned and approved, it can generally not be changed except in the case of error.  For example, a species of beetle (''[[Anophthalmus hitleri]]'') was named by a German collector after [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933 when he had recently become chancellor of Germany.&lt;ref name="hitler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosegeorge.com/site/a-beetle-called-hitler|title=A beetle called Hitler|date=13 April 2002|work=Rose George}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear whether such a dedication would be considered acceptable or appropriate today, but the name remains in use.&lt;ref name="hitler" /&gt;

Species names have been chosen on many different bases. Most common is a naming for the species' external appearance, its origin, or the species name is a dedication for a certain person.  Examples would include a bat species named for the two stripes on its back (''[[Saccopteryx bilineata]]''), a frog named for its Bolivian origin (''[[Phyllomedusa boliviana]]''), and an ant species dedicated to the actor Harrison Ford (''[[Pheidole harrisonfordi]]''). A scientific name in honor of a person or persons is a known as a taxonomic '''patronym''' or patronymic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Capinera|editor1-first=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1402062427|page=2765|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2765&amp;dq=patronymic+scientific+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gbPyU5rDH4G2iwKYxoGQBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=patronym&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Strahan|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Conder|editor2-first=Pamela|title=Dictionary of Australian and New Guinean Mammals|date=2007|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmJsAzEXRyEC&amp;pg=PT15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of humorous species names also exist.  Literary examples include the genus name ''[[Borogovia]]'' (an extinct dinosaur), which is named after the borogove, a mythical character from Lewis Carrol's poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".  A second example, ''[[Macrocarpaea apparata]]'' (a tall plant) was named after the magical spell "to apparate" from the Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling, as it seemed to appear out of nowhere.&lt;ref name="funnyspeciesnames"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/index.html|title=Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the British naturalist [[Peter Scott]] proposed the binomial name ''[[Nessiteras rhombopteryx]]'' ("Ness monster with diamond-shaped fin") for the Loch Ness Monster; it was soon spotted that it was an anagram of "Monster hoax by Sir Peter S".

=== Species names recognizing benefactors ===
{{see also|List of organisms named after famous people}}
Species have frequently been named by scientists in recognition of supporters and benefactors.  For example, the genus ''[[Victoria (plant)|Victoria]]'' (a flowering waterplant) was named in honour of Queen Victoria of Great Britain.  More recently, a species of lemur (''[[Avahi cleesei]]'') was named after the actor [[John Cleese]] in recognition of his work to publicize the plight of lemurs in Madagascar.

Non-profit ecological organizations may also allow benefactors to name new species in exchange for financial support for taxonomic research and nature conservation. A German non-profit organisation (gemeinnütziger Verein), [[BIOPAT - Patrons for Biodiversity]] has raised more than $450,000 for research and conservation through sponsorship of over 100 species using this model.&lt;ref name="fundingecologicalresearch"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.unep.org/dec/onlinemanual/Enforcement/InstitutionalFrameworks/EconomicInstruments/Resource/tabid/1014/Default.aspx|title=Financing conservation efforts by selling naming rights of new species}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual example of this system is the ''[[Callicebus aureipalatii]]'' (or "monkey of the Golden Palace"), which was named after the [[GoldenPalace.com|Golden Palace casino]] in recognition of a $650,000 contribution to the [[Madidi National Park]] in Bolivia in 2005.

The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) discourages this practice somewhat: "Recommendation 20A. Authors forming generic names should comply with the following ... (h) Not dedicate genera to persons quite unconcerned with botany, mycology, phycology, or natural science in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|ref=ICN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of species descriptions ==
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|Original title page of [[Linnaeus]]'s ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', published in 1735.]]
Early biologists often published entire volumes or multiple-volume works of descriptions in an attempt to catalog all known species. These catalogs typically featured extensive descriptions of each species and were often illustrated upon reprinting.

The first of these large catalogs was [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals]]'', published around 343 B.C. Aristotle included descriptions of creatures, mostly fish and invertebrates, in his homeland, and several [[mythological creature]]s rumored to live in far-away lands, such as the [[manticore]].

In 77 A.D. [[Pliny the Elder]] dedicated several volumes of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' to the description of all life forms he knew to exist.  He appears to have read Aristotle's work, since he writes about many of the same far-away mythological creatures.

Toward the end of the 12th century, ''[[Konungs skuggsjá]]'', an [[Old Norse]] [[philosophical]] [[didactic]] work, featured several descriptions of the whales, seals, and monsters of the Icelandic seas. These descriptions were brief and often erroneous, and a description of the [[mermaid]] and a rare island-like sea monster called [[Hafgufa|Hafgufu]] was included. The author was hesitant to mention the beast (known today to be fictitious) for fear of its size, but felt it was important enough to be included in his descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Konungs skuggsjá|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05178869&amp;id=LgtIfLwQgX4C&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q=hafgfua&amp;f=false|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the earliest recognized species authority is [[Linnaeus]], who standardized the modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] system beginning with his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1735.&lt;ref name = "linnaeus"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus, C.]]|title = [[Systema Naturae]]|year = 1735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the catalog of known species was increasing rapidly, it became impractical to maintain a single work documenting every species.  Publishing a paper documenting a single species was much faster and could be done by scientists with less broadened scopes of study.  For example, a scientist who discovered a new species of insect would not need to understand plants, or frogs, or even insects which did not resemble the species, but would only need to understand closely related insects.

== Modern species descriptions ==
Formal species descriptions today follow strict guidelines set forth by the [[codes of nomenclature]]. Very detailed formal descriptions are made by scientists, who usually study the organism closely for a considerable time. A '''diagnosis''' may be used instead of,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|loc=Article 38|ref=ICN}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as well as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |date=1999 |title= International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Fourth Edition, adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences  |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=13&amp;nfv=true}} article 13&lt;/ref&gt; the description. A diagnosis specifies the distinction between the new species and other species.

== Rates of species description ==
According to the RetroSOS report,&lt;ref name="retroSOS2012"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Quentin Wheeler |authorlink= |author2=Sara Pennak |date=January 18, 2012 |title=Retro SOS 2000-2009: A Decade of Species Discovery in Review |url=http://www.esf.edu/species/SOS.htm |publisher=International Institute for Species Exploration, Arizona State University |page= |docket= |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following numbers of species have been described each year since 2000.

{{Expand French|Commission_Stasi|date=January 2012}}
The French '''commission Stasi''' is a commission set up to reflect upon the application of the ''[[laïcité]]'' principle. Named after the chair [[Bernard Stasi]], [[ombudsman]] of the (French) Republic (''médiateur de la République'') since 1998, and consisting of 20 members, it was set up by the [[President of France|president of the Republic]] [[Jacques Chirac]] on 3 July 2003. It reported its conclusions on 11 December 2003.

==Overview==

Jacques Chirac established the commission to reflect upon the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' and its application in France. He appointed Bernard Stasi to oversee the commission.&lt;ref&gt;France 5, ''Dossiers - Débat Public :'' [http://www.france5.fr/actu_societe/W00137/9/102197.cfm La laïcité (La Commission Stasi)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the commission interviewed various representatives from different groups, for example religious leaders such as [[Cardinal Lustiger]], intellectuals such as [[Régis Debray]] and [[Patrick Weil]] as well school headteachers, political leaders, equal-rights groups and social groups (for example the [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rapports/r1275-t2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;



The commission emerged from public debates concerning the place of the [[hijab]] in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi Commission lead to the introduction of the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.

In response to the commission's report Jacques Chirac called for the French public to unite around the principle of laïcité.

==Principles==

The report espouses two key stances that emerge from the history of secularism in France: state neutrality in regard to religion and [[freedom of thought]] particularly in relation to freedom of worship. The report also acknowledges that tensions arise between these two principles particularly in the spheres of the army, prisons, hospitals and education.

The Commission also called for the incorporation of 'accomodements raisonables' or [[reasonable accommodation]] into the principles of laïcité for problems that are not covered by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].

[[File:Map of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.svg|thumb|{{legend|#50C878|State parties to the Stockholm Convention as of 2017}}]]

'''Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants''' is an international [[environmental law|environmental]] [[treaty]], signed in 2001 and effective from May 2004, that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs).

== History ==
In 1995, the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) called for global action to be taken on POPs, which it defined as “chemical substances that persist in the environment, [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulate]] through the [[food web]], and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment”.

Following this, the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) and the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] (IPCS) prepared an assessment of the 12 worst offenders, known as the ''dirty dozen''.

The INC met five times between June 1998 and December 2000 to elaborate the convention, and delegates adopted the Stockholm Convention on POPs at the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries convened from 22–23 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden.

The negotiations for the Convention were completed on 23 May 2001 in [[Stockholm]]. The convention entered into force on 17 May 2004 with [[ratification]] by an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agree to outlaw nine of the dirty dozen chemicals, limit the use of [[DDT]] to [[malaria]] control, and curtail inadvertent production of dioxins and [[furan]]s.

Parties to the convention have agreed to a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the convention, if they meet certain criteria for persistence and transboundary threat. The first set of new chemicals to be added to the Convention were agreed at a conference in [[Geneva]] on 8 May 2009.

As of June 2018, there are 182 parties to the Convention, (181 states and the [[European Union]]).&lt;ref name="UNTC" /&gt; Notable non-ratifying states include the United States, Israel, Malaysia, and Italy.

The Stockholm Convention was adopted to [[European Union|EU]] legislation in REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0007:0049:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of provisions==
Key elements of the Convention include the requirement that developed countries provide new and additional financial resources and measures to eliminate production and use of intentionally produced POPs, eliminate unintentionally produced POPs where feasible, and manage and dispose of POPs wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Precaution is exercised throughout the Stockholm Convention, with specific references in the preamble, the objective, and the provision on identifying new POPs.

==Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee==
When adopting the Convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 2–6 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the Convention.

The Committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the Convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland since its establishment. 
	
The seventh meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC-7) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took place from 10–14 October 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland. POPRC-8 was held from 15–19 October 2012 in Geneva, POPRC-9 to POPRC-13 were held in Rome.

== Listed substances ==
There were initially twelve distinct chemicals listed in three categories. Two chemicals, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Chemicals newly proposed for inclusion in Annexes A,B,C==
POPRC-7 considered three proposals for listing in Annexes A, B and/or C of the Convention: [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|chlorinated naphthalenes]] (CNs), [[hexachlorobutadiene]] (HCBD) and [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), its salts and esters. The proposal is the first stage of the POPRC's work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the Convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.

POPRC-8 proposed [[hexabromocyclododecane]] for listing in Annex A, with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. This proposal was agreed at the sixth Conference of Parties on 28 April-10 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC8/POPRC8Followup/HBCDRecommendation/tabid/2912/Default.aspx|title=HBCD Recommendation|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

POPRC-9 proposed [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|di-,tri-,tetra-,penta-,hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated napthalenes]], and hexachlorobutadiene for listing in Annexes A and C. It also set up further work on pentachlorophenol, its salts and esters, and decabromodiphenyl ether, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC9/POPRC9Documents/tabid/3281/Default.aspx|title=Stockholm Convention &gt; The Convention &gt; POPs Review Committee &gt; Meetings &gt; POPRC 9 &gt; Documents|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Although some critics have alleged that the treaty is responsible for the continuing death toll from malaria, in reality the treaty specifically permits the public health use of [[DDT]] for the control of [[mosquito]]es (the malaria [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Curtis, C.

As long as there are specific measures taken, such as use of DDT indoors, then the limited amount of DDT can be used in a regulated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/69945|title=The use of DDT in malaria vector control : WHO position statement|last=World Health Organization.

Another controversy would be certain POPs (which are continually active, specifically in the Arctic Biota) that were mentioned in the Stockholm Convention, but were not part of the Dirty Dozen such as Perfluorooctone sulfonates (PFOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godduhn|first=Anna|last2=Duffy|first2=Lawrence K.|date=August 2003|title=Multi-generation health risks of persistent organic pollution in the far north: use of the precautionary approach in the Stockholm Convention|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1462-9011(03)00061-3|journal=Environmental Science and Policy|volume=6|issue=4|pages=341–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFOs have many general uses such as stain repellents but have many properties which can make it a dangerous due to the fact that PFOs can be highly resistant to environmental breakdown. PFOs can be toxic in terms of increased offspring death, decrease in body weight, and the disruption of neurological systems. What makes this compound controversial is the economic and political impact it can have among various countries and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Thanh Wang, Yawei Wang, Chunyang Liao, Yaqi Cai and Guibin Jiang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4634">In [[structural anthropology]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], a French [[anthropologist]], makes the claim that "myth is language". Through approaching [[mythology]] as language, Lévi-Strauss suggests that it can be approached the same way as language can be approached by the same structuralist methods used to address language. Thus, Lévi-Strauss offers a '''structuralist theory of mythology''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus Gabriel]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], ''Mythology, Madness, and Laughter: Subjectivity in German Idealism'', Continuum, 2009, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; he clarifies, "Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps rolling."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Lévi-Strauss breaks down his argument into three main parts. Meaning is not isolated within the specific fundamental parts of the myth, but rather within the composition of these parts. Although myth and language are of similar categories, language functions differently in myth. Finally, language in myth exhibits more complex functions than in any other linguistic expression. From these suggestions, he draws the conclusion that myth can be broken down into constituent units, and these units are different from the constituents of language. Finally, unlike the constituents of language, the constituents of a myth, which he labels “mythemes,” function as "bundles of relations."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is a break from the “symbolists”, such as [[Carl Jung]], who dedicate themselves to find meaning solely within the constituents rather than their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Hanéff, ''Claude Lévi-Strauss, p. 160''&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Lévi-Strauss uses the example of the Oedipus myth and breaks it down to its component parts:

Reading it in sequence from left to right, top to bottom, the myth is categorized sequentially and by similarities. Through analyzing the commonalities between the “mythemes” of the [[Oedipus]] story, understandings can be wrought from its categories. 

Thus, a structural approach towards myths is to address all of these constituents. Furthermore, a structural approach should account for all versions of a myth, as all versions are relevant to the function of the myth as a whole. This leads to what Lévi-Strauss calls a spiral growth of the myth which is continuous while the structure itself is not. The growth of the myth only ends when the 
“intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted.”&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; 

== From mythology to literary criticism ==

Myths are primarily acknowledged as oral traditions, while literature is in the form of written text. Still, anthropologists and [[literary critics]] would both acknowledge the links between myths and relatively more contemporary literature. Therefore, many literary critics take the same Lévi-Straussian structuralist, as it is coined, approach to literature. This approach is, again, similar to [[Symbolist]] critics’ approach to literature. There is a search for the lowest constituent of the story. But as with the myth, Lévi-Straussian structuralism then analyzes the relations between these constituent parts in order to compare even greater relations between versions of stories as well as among stories themselves.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Boon, ''From Symbolism to Structuralism. p. 6-12.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, Lévi-Strauss suggests that the structural approach and mental processes dedicated towards analyzing the myth are similar in nature to those in science. This connection between myth and science is further elaborated in his books, “Myth and Meaning” and "The Savage Mind". He suggests that the foundation of structuralism is based upon an innate understanding of the scientific process, which seeks to break down complex phenomena into its component parts and then analyze the relations between them. The structuralist approach to myth is precisely the same method, and as a method this can be readily applied to literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Meaning p.5-14''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''supervillain''' is a variant of the [[villain]]ous [[stock character]] that is commonly found in [[American comic book]]s, usually possessing [[superhuman]] abilities. A supervillain is the antithesis of a [[superhero]]. A female supervillain is sometimes called a '''supervillainess'''{{citation-needed|date=August 2018}}, although the word supervillain is commonly used for females also.

Supervillains are often used as [[foil (literature)|foils]] to present a daunting challenge to a superhero. In instances where the supervillain does not have superhuman, mystical, or alien powers, the supervillain may possess a genius intellect or a skill set that allows them to draft complex schemes or commit crimes in a way normal humans cannot. Other traits may include [[megalomania]] and possession of considerable resources to further their aims. Many supervillains share some typical characteristics of real world [[dictator]]s, [[gangster]]s, and [[terrorism|terrorists]], with aspirations of [[world domination]] or universal leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=006131;p=0 |title=Eury &amp; Misiroglu On The Supervillain Book |publisher=Comicon.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218045716/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=006131;p=0 |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable supervillains==
The [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Lex Luthor]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Darkseid]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], and [[Thanos]] are some notable male comic book supervillains and have been [[Film adaptation|adapted]] to film and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/06/18/the-joker-tops-supervillain-poll-199239/ |title=Joker tops supervillain poll |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/characters/tp/toptenvillains.htm |title=Top Ten Comic Book Super Villains |publisher=Comicbooks.about.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable examples of female supervillains are the [[Catwoman]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Talia al Ghul]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] and [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Dark Phoenix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/15629-lethal-ladies-the-10-best-female-supervillains.html|title=Lethal Ladies ; The 10 Best Female Supervillains|publisher=Newsarama.com|accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/2801704/maleficent-villains-wicked-witch-catwoman/|title=Maleficent and 16 Other Famous Queens of Mean|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like superheroes, supervillains are sometimes members of supervillain groups, such as the [[Sinister Six]], the [[Suicide Squad]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], the [[Injustice League]], the [[Legion of Doom]], and the [[Masters of Evil]].

The '''Terrafugia TF-X''' is the first fully autonomous flying car under development by Boston-based [[Terrafugia]]. Its expected release date is listed as eight to twelve years.&lt;ref name=TF-X&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrafugia.com/tf-x|title=TF-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TF-X seats four passengers and uses an engine combined with two electric motors for propulsion.&lt;ref name=Autoblog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/27/this-awesome-terrafugia-electric-vehicle-will-fly-someday/|title=This awesome Terrafugia electric vehicle will fly, someday [w/video]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previously proposed [[Terrafugia Transition|Transition]], the TF-X is capable of [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]] by extending its retractable wings attached with pusher propellers while aerial thrust is provided by a ducted fan at the rear.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20150730-terrafugia|title=Terrafugia TF-X, the flying supercar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be able to fit in a single car garage.

Powered by two plug-in hybrid 600-horsepower electric motors and a 300-horsepower fuel engine, the TF-X is planned to have a flight range of 500 miles  (805&amp;nbsp;km) with a cruising flight speed of 200&amp;nbsp;mph (322&amp;nbsp;km/h) without the need to refuel or recharge.&lt;ref name=Autoblog /&gt; Road speed is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Top Gear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/car-news/future-tech/flying-car-here-last-its-terrafugias-tf-x|title=The flying car is here at last! It's Terrafugia's TF-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==

Due to the success of the Transition vehicle, Terrafugia announced in 2013 that they were developing the TF-X. When in flight, the TF-X is effectively autonomous, with its pilot able to navigate to a pre-specified landing zone—and pre-selected backup landing zones—by itself, although manual controls and overrides exist. Final landing must be approved by the pilot. The TF-X will also provide operators the choice to fly in either manual or automatic during flight with the ability to control the vehicle in a manner similar to steering the wheel of an automobile. Terrafugia claims that learning to drive the TF-X is likely to take five hours and will take substantially less time to learn how to safely operate than a traditional aircraft.&lt;ref name=TF-X /&gt;

===Safety features===

The TF-X will be capable of avoiding air traffic, bad weather, and restricted and tower-controlled airspace. For additional safety features, the TF-X would automatically land at the nearest airport if the operator becomes unresponsive. Additionally, if a TF-X operator declares an emergency, the authorities will be automatically notified of the situation and the TF-X can be landed in a non-approved landing zone. The TF-X also features a backup full vehicle parachute system that can be activated if the operator believes the vehicle is incapable of auto-landing.&lt;ref name=TF-X /&gt;

===Pricing===

Pricing is expected to be upwards of £200,000 (roughly $300,000).&lt;ref name=Autocar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-terrafugia-tf-x-flying-car-revealed|title=New Terrafugia TF-X flying car revealed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''The Anatomy of Dependence'''''|甘えの構造|''Amae no Kōzō''}} is a non-fiction book written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Takeo Doi]], discussing at length Doi's concept of ''amae'', which he describes as a uniquely Japanese need to be in good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself. He likens this to behaving childishly in the assumption that parents will indulge you (Doi 2001:16), and claims that the ideal relationship is that of the parent-child, and all other relationships should strive for this degree of closeness (Doi 2001:39).

==Main concept==
'''''Amae''''' ({{lang|ja|甘え}}) is the nominal form of the verb ''amaeru'', which Doi uses to describe the behavior of a person attempting to induce an authority figure, such as a parent, spouse, teacher, or supervisor, to take care of him. The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out ''amae'' may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of ''amae'', but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2000 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |title=Is ''amae'' the Key to Understanding Japanese Culture? |author=Herman W Smith &amp; Takako Nomi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220062826/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literary context===
Doi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while ''amae'' is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that ''amae'' is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs.&lt;ref name="Doi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Doi |first=Takeo |title=The Anatomy of Dependence: The Key Analysis of Japanese Behavior |year=1981 |edition=2nd |publisher=Kodansha International |location=Tokyo |others=English trans. John Bester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (''sasshi'' {{lang|ja|察し}}), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (''enryo'' {{lang|ja|遠慮}}), and the [[Tatemae and Honne|''tatemae–honne'']] dynamics are communicative manifestations of the ''amae'' psychology of Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Keio Communication Review |volume=25 |pages=93–115 |year=2003 |url=http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2003/review25/7.pdf |title=Japanese ''Enryo–Sasshi'' Communication and the Psychology of ''Amae'': Reconsideration and Reconceptualization |author=Yoshitaka Miike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Doi translates ''amaeru'' as "to depend and presume upon another's benevolence". It indicates, for Doi, "helplessness and the desire to be loved". ''Amaeru'' can also be defined as "to wish to be loved", and denotes [[dependency need]]s. ''Amae'' is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one's perceived needs.

Doi says,
{{quote|"The psychological prototype of 'amae' lies in the psychology of the infant in its relationship to its mother; not a newborn infant, but an infant who has already realised that its mother exists independently of itself&amp;nbsp;... [A]s its mind develops it gradually realises that itself and its mother are independent existences, and comes to feel the mother as something indispensable to itself, it is the craving for close contact thus developed that constitutes, one might say, amae."&lt;ref name="Doi"/&gt;}}

According to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:
{{quote|"He may be your father or your older brother or sister ... But he may just as well be your section head at the office, the leader of your local political faction, or simply a fellow struggler down life's byways who happened to be one or two years ahead of you at school or the university. The amae syndrome is pervasive in Japanese life."&lt;ref name="Gibney"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibney |first=Frank |title= Japan: The Fragile Superpower |year=1975 |publisher=Norton |isbn=0-393-05530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Amae'' may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, ''amae'' does have a connotation of [[maturity (psychology)|immaturity]], but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of [[romantic love|romance]] so common in the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Critical reception===
Doi's work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in [[nihonjinron]] studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P. 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)

Doi's work has been hailed as a distinctive contribution to psychoanalysis by the American psychiatrist [[Frank A. Johnson|Frank Johnson]], who has devoted a full book-length study to Doi and to his critics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Johnson,''Dependency and Japanese socialization: psychoanalytic and anthropological investigations into amae'', 1993 New York, New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
It was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by [[John Bester]] was later published in 1973.

'''The Thing''' is an international net-community of artists and art-related projects that was started in 1991 by [[Wolfgang Staehle]]. The Thing was launched as a mailbox system accessible over the telephone network in New York feeding a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) in 1991 before their website was launched in 1995 on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], ''Art and Electronic Media''. London: Phaidon, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, The Thing grew into a diverse online community made up of dozens of members' Web sites, mailing lists, a successful Web hosting service, a community studio in Chelsea (NYC), and the first Web site devoted to [[Net Art]]: bbs.thing.net.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== The Thing BBS (1991)===
In 1991, The Thing began as a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) focusing on contemporary art and cultural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Daniels, Gunther Reisinger (Eds.) “Net Pioneers 1.0: Contextualizing Early Net-Based Art”, Sternberg. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the writer and critic Blackhawk (having recently produced the film ''[[Cyberpunk]]'') taught Wolfgang Staehle many of the abilities he needed to start the original The Thing BBS. Blackhawk was the first person Staehle turned to after conceiving the idea for an electronic culture resource based on the model of [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[Social sculpture]]''. Blackhawk and Wolfgang jointly set up the editorial structure of the original BBS and planned for many of the then experimental activities that took place. Other people who helped develop and shape the content of the early BBS included [[Josefina Ayerza]], [[Dike Blair]], Donald Newman, the original programmer, Jordan Crandall, David Platzker, Josh Decter, [[Rainer Ganahl]], [[Julia Scher]], [[Barry Schwabsky]], Morgan Garwood, Franz von Stauffenberg and Benjamin Weil.

A second node, The Thing Cologne, was added in 1992, followed by The Thing Vienna in November 1993. Nodes in Berlin and elsewhere were soon to follow.

===The Thing on the Web (1995)===
The Thing changed its form when a website was created for a presentation at the 1995 [[Ars Electronica]]. Credits on the 1995 website also name Nicky Chaikin, [[John F. Simon Jr.]], [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Rob Keenan, Darryl Erentzen and John Rabasa.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.thing.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 The Thing set up an independent art network with hardware of its own that offered arts communities ways to establish themselves, to send information to one another and also to conceive of new artistic practices deriving from [[conceptual art]] and from [[performance art]]. The idea was that working with the Internet was a way to operate around the institutions of art distribution of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Max Kossatz designed ''The Thing Communicator'' a website mimicking many functions of the original BBS including member login, chat and messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The most [[interactive]] area of The Thing consisted of various message boards offering forums for [[art theory]] debate, news and gossip, ongoing dialogue and an open-access flow of information as well as several online versions of art journals.

Alongside discussion forums The Thing has offered artworks in the form of [[graphics]] downloadable to the home [[personal computer]] – for example by [[Peter Halley]].

===thing.net communities===
The Thing has enabled a diverse group of artists, critics, curators, and activists to use the internet in its early stages. At its core, The Thing is a [[social network]], made up of individuals from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of expert knowledge. From this social hub, The Thing has built an array of programs and initiatives, in both technological and cultural networks. During its first five years, TT became widely recognized as one of the founding and leading online centers for [[new media]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include hosting artists' projects and mailing lists - as well as publishing cultural criticism.

The Thing has also organized many public events and symposia on such topics as the state of [[new media]] arts, the preservation of online privacy, artistic innovations in [[robotics]], and the possibilities of community empowerment through wireless technologies.

In 1997, thing.net communications, LLC, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) was incorporated by Wolfgang Staehle, Gisela Ehrenfried and Max Kossatz.  The ISP was to provide a financial backbone for The Thing Inc. (a 501 c 3 non profit organization).  thing.net has hosted arts and activist groups and publications including [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]], [[Artforum]], [[Mabou Mines]], [[Willoughby Sharp]] Gallery, [[Zingmagazine]],  Journal of Contemporary Art, [[RTMark]] and Tenant.net.

Among many others, artists and projects associated with thing.net have included Sawad Brooks, [[Heath Bunting]], Cercle Ramo Nash, [[Vuk Cosic]], [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], [[Ursula Endlicher]], [[etoy]], [[GH Hovagimyan]], Jérôme Joy, [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], Jenny Marketou, [[Mariko Mori]], [[Olivier Mosset]], Prema Murty, [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Phil Niblock]], Daniel Pflumm, [[Francesca da Rimini]], [[Beat Streuli]] and Beth Stryker.

'''Thomas Nagel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ei|g|əl}}; born July 4, 1937) is an American philosopher and University Professor of Philosophy and Law Emeritus at [[New York University]], where he taught from 1980 to 2016.&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt; His main areas of philosophical interest are [[philosophy of mind]], [[political philosophy]] and [[ethics]].

Nagel is well known for his critique of [[Materialism|material]] [[reductionist]] accounts of the mind, particularly in his essay "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]" (1974), and for his contributions to [[deontological]] and liberal moral and political theory in ''The Possibility of Altruism'' (1970) and subsequent writings. He continued the critique of reductionism in ''[[Mind and Cosmos]]'' (2012), in which he argues against the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] view of the emergence of [[consciousness]].

==Philosophical work==

===Overview===
Nagel began to publish philosophy at the age of twenty-two; his career now spans over fifty years of publication. Nagel thinks that each person, owing to his or her capacity to reason, instinctively seeks a unified world view. However, if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments, whether about the external world, knowledge, or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be, this leads one into error. For contingent, limited and finite creatures, no such unified world view is possible. That is because ways of understanding are not always better when they are more objective.

Like the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]], Nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it. A modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces. It is more objective because it is less dependent on our peculiarities as the kinds of thinkers that people are. Our modern scientific understanding involves the mathematicized understanding of the world represented by modern [[physics]]. Understanding this beached out view of the world draws on our capacities as purely rational thinkers and fails to account for the specific nature of our perceptual sensibility. The way in which modern science and philosophy has [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|drawn a distinction]] between the mathematically and structurally describable "primary qualities" of objects such as shape and solidity and those properties dependent on our sensory apparatus, "secondary qualities" such as taste and color, is a prime example that Nagel returns to repeatedly in his work.

Despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science, Nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us. His contention, rather, is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective. He argues that the subjective viewpoint of scientific understanding, when applied to the mind, leaves out something essential and is fundamentally unable to help people fully understand themselves. In "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]" and elsewhere, he writes that science cannot describe what it is like ''to be'' a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective.

Nagel argues that some [[phenomena]] are not best grasped from a more objective perspective. The standpoint of the thinker does not present itself to him: he is that standpoint. One learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one's own mind, whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact. It would, of its nature, leave out what it is to be a thinker, and that, Nagel believes, would be a falsely objectifying view. Being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain.

Nagel thinks that philosophers over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science tend to produce [[Philosophy of mind|theories of the mind]] that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way. They are right to be impressed – modern science really is objective – but are wrong to take modern science to be the only paradigm of objectivity. The kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand.

As a philosophical [[Rationalism|rationalist]], Nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of [[mental properties]] in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental, and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future. A plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects. Now, it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight, or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap, but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding.

Nagel's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite, structured around our capacity to reason, explains why he thinks that [[Therapeutic approach|therapeutic]] or [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that [[radical skepticism]] is, strictly speaking, irrefutable.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The therapeutic or deflationary philosopher, influenced by the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our "form of life". Nagel accuses Wittgenstein and American philosopher of mind and language [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] of [[philosophical idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1986, ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared, objective world. This, for Nagel, elevates contingent conditions of our make-up into criteria for that which is real. The result 'cuts the world down to size' and makes what there is dependent on what there can be interpreted to be. Nagel claims this is no better than more orthodox forms of idealism in which reality is claimed to be made up of mental items or claimed to be constitutively dependent on a form supplied by the mind.

===Philosophy of mind===

====What is it like to be a something====
{{further|What Is it Like to Be a Bat?}}
Nagel is probably most widely known within the field of [[philosophy of mind]] as an advocate of the idea that [[consciousness]] and [[subjective experience]] cannot, at least with the contemporary understanding of [[physicalism]], be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics. This position was primarily discussed by Nagel in one of his most famous articles: "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974). The article's title question, though often attributed to Nagel, was originally asked by [[Timothy Sprigge|Timothy M.B. Sprigge]]. The article was originally published in 1974 in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', and has been reprinted several times, including in ''[[The Mind's I]]'' (edited by [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]]), ''Readings in the Philosophy of Psychology'' (edited by Ned Block), Nagel's ''Mortal Questions'' (1979), ''[[The Nature of Mind]]'' (edited by [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]]), and ''[[Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings]]'' (edited by [[David J. Chalmers]]).

In "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", Nagel argues that consciousness has essential to it a ''subjective character,'' a ''what it is like'' aspect.  He states that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to ''be'' that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974), p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics{{who|date=March 2017}} have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world (trivially, one can only do so from his own point of view) to a false claim about the world, that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it. On that understanding, Nagel is a conventional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] about the physical and the mental. This is, however, a misunderstanding{{according to|date=March 2017}}: Nagel's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state, namely, that one be directly acquainted with it. Concepts of mental states are only made available to a thinker who can be acquainted with his/her own states; clearly, the possession and use of physical concepts has no corresponding constraint.

Part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination: influenced by his [[Princeton University|Princeton]] colleague, [[Saul Kripke]], Nagel believes that any [[Type physicalism|type identity]] statement that identified a physical state type with a [[mental state]] type would be, if true, [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. But Kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where, for example, one's [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibres]] are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair. (A parallel argument does not hold for genuine [[Identity (philosophy)|theoretical identities]].) This argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded, Nagel argues, by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways. When asked to imagine ''sensorily'', one imagines C-fibres being stimulated; if asked to imagine ''sympathetically'', one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain. These two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap, whether or not this is the case. (Some philosophers of mind{{who|date=October 2018}} have taken these arguments as helpful for [[physicalism]] on the grounds that it exposes a limitation that makes the existence of an explanatory gap seem compelling, while others{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued that this makes the case for physicalism even more impossible as it cannot be defended even in principle.)

Nagel is not a physicalist because he does not believe that an internal understanding of mental concepts shows them to have the kind of hidden [[essence]] that underpins a scientific identity in, say, chemistry. But his skepticism is about current physics: he envisages in his most recent work that people may be close to a scientific breakthrough in identifying an underlying essence that is neither physical (as people currently think of the physical), nor [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functional]], nor mental, but such that it necessitates all three of these ways in which the mind "appears" to us. The difference between the kind of explanation he rejects and those that he accepts depends on his understanding of [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparency]]: from his earliest paper to his most recent Nagel has always insisted that a prior context is required to make identity statements plausible, intelligible and transparent.

====Natural selection and consciousness====
{{further|Mind and Cosmos}}
In his 2012 book ''Mind and Cosmos'', Nagel argues against a [[Materialism|materialist]] view of the emergence of life and consciousness, writing that the standard [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] view flies in the face of common sense.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} He writes that [[mind]] is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|16ff}} He argues that the principles that account for the emergence of life may be [[teleological]], rather than materialist or mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Despite Nagel's being an atheist and not a proponent of [[intelligent design]] (ID), his book was "praised by [[creationists]]", according to the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt; Nagel writes in ''Mind and Cosmos'' that he disagrees with both ID defenders and their opponents, who argue that the only naturalistic alternative to ID is the current reductionist neo-Darwinian model.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Nagel has argued that ID should not be rejected as non-scientific, for instance writing in 2008 that "ID is very different from [[creation science]]," and that the debate about ID "is clearly a scientific disagreement, not a disagreement between science and something else."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. (2008). "Public education and intelligent design," ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 36(2), pp. 187–205&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he recommended ''[[Signature in the Cell]]'' by the philosopher and ID proponent [[Stephen C. Meyer]] in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' as one of his "Best Books of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article706973.ece|title=Arguments: Thomas Nagel and Stephen C. Meyer’s Signature in the Cell - TLS|publisher=The-tls.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagel does not accept Meyer's conclusions but he endorsed Meyer's approach, and argued in ''Mind and Cosmos'' that Meyer and other ID proponents, [[David Berlinski]] and [[Michael Behe]], "do not deserve the scorn with which they are commonly met."&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

[[Steven Pinker]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] both dismissed the book.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129/|website=The Chronicle Review|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

====Nagel's Rawlsian approach====
Nagel has been highly influential in the related fields of moral and [[political philosophy]]. Supervised by [[John Rawls]], Nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a [[Kantian]] and [[rationalist]] approach to [[moral philosophy]]. His distinctive ideas were first presented in the short [[monograph]] ''The Possibility of Altruism,'' published in 1970. That book seeks by reflection on the nature of [[practical reasoning]] to uncover the formal principles that underlie reason in practice and the related general beliefs about the self that are necessary for those principles to be truly applicable to us. Nagel defends motivated desire theory about the motivation of moral action. According to motivated desire theory, when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire. But it is important to get the justificatory relations right: when a person accepts a moral judgment he or she is necessarily motivated to act. But it is the reason that does the justificatory work of justifying both the action and the desire. Nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification. An account based on presupposing sympathy would be of this kind.

The most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person. When one reasons prudentially, for example about the future reasons that one will have, one allows the reason in the future to justify one's current action without reference to the strength of one's current desires. If a hurricane were to destroy someone's car next year at that point he will want his insurance company to pay him to replace it: that future reason gives him a reason, now, to take out insurance. The strength of the reason ought not to be hostage to the strength of one's current desires. The denial of this view of prudence, Nagel argues, means that one does not really believe that one is one and the same person through time. One is dissolving oneself into distinct person-stages.

====Altruistic action====
This is the basis of his analogy between prudential actions and moral actions: in cases of [[altruistic]] action for another person's good that person's reasons quite literally become reasons for one if they are timeless and intrinsic reasons. Genuine reasons are reasons for anyone. Comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]], Nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one's good as an impersonal good and one's reasons as objective reasons. That means, practically, that a timeless and intrinsic value generates reasons for anyone. A person who denies the truth of this claim is committed, as in the case of a similar mistake about prudence, to a false view of him or herself. In this case the false view is that one's reasons are irreducibly his, in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone: Nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she cannot make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally. Nagel calls this "[[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]" and considers it a practical analogue of [[solipsism]] (the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist). Once again, a false view of what is involved in reasoning properly is refuted by showing that it leads to a false view of the nature of people.

====Subjective and objective reasons====
Nagel's later work on ethics ceases to place as much weight on the distinction between a person's personal or "[[Subjectivity|subjective]]" reasons and his or her "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]" reasons. Earlier, in ''The Possibility of Altruism,'' he took the stance that if one's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then, ''qua'' subjective reason, one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones. In later discussions, Nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values, and speaks instead of "agent-relative" and "agent-neutral" reasons. In the case of agent-relative reasons (the successor to subjective reasons) specifying the content of the reason makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a reason. An example of this might be: "Anyone has a reason to honor his or her parents." By contrast, in the case of agent-neutral reasons (the successor to objective reasons) specifying the content of the reason does not make any essential reference back to the person for whom it is a reason. An example of this might be: "Anyone has a reason to promote the good of parenthood."

====Objective reasons====
The different classes of reasons and values (i.e., agent-relative and agent-neutral) emphasized in Nagel's later work are situated within a Sidgwickian model in which one's moral commitments are thought of objectively, such that one's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole. The structure of Nagel's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself. Those reasons and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective, but more subjective reasons and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated. However, the most striking part of the earlier argument and of Sidgwick's view is preserved: agent-neutral reasons are literally reasons for anyone, so all objectifiable reasons become individually possessed no matter whose they are. Thinking reflectively about ethics from this standpoint, one must take every other agent's standpoint on value as seriously as one's own, since one's own perspective is just a subjective take on an inter-subjective whole; one's personal set of reasons is thus swamped by the objective reasons of all others.

====World agent views====
This is similar to "world agent" [[consequentialist]] views in which one takes up the standpoint of a collective subject whose reasons are those of everyone. But Nagel remains an [[individualist]] who believes in the separateness of persons so his task is to explain why this objective viewpoint does not swallow up the individual standpoint of each of us. He provides an extended rationale for the importance to people of their personal point of view. The result is a hybrid ethical theory of the kind defended by Nagel's Princeton PhD student [[Samuel Scheffler]] in ''The Rejection of Consequentialism''. The objective standpoint and its demands have to be balanced with the subjective personal point of view of each person and its demands. One can always be maximally objective but one does not have to be. One can legitimately "cap" the demands placed on him by the objective reasons of others. In addition, in his later work, Nagel finds a rationale for so-called [[deontic]] constraints in a way Scheffler could not. Following Warren Quinn and Frances Kamm, Nagel grounds them on the [[inviolability]] of persons.

====Political philosophy====
The extent to which one can lead a good life as an individual while respecting the demands of others leads inevitably to political philosophy. In the Locke lectures published as the book ''Equality and Partiality'', Nagel exposes [[John Rawls|John Rawls's]] [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]] to detailed scrutiny. Once again, Nagel places such weight on the objective point of view and its requirements that he finds Rawls's view of liberal equality not demanding enough. Rawls's aim to redress, not remove, the inequalities that arise from class and talent seems to Nagel to lead to a view that does not sufficiently respect the needs of others. He recommends a gradual move to much more demanding conceptions of equality, motivated by the special nature of political responsibility. Normally people draw a distinction between that which people do and that which people fail to bring about. But this thesis, true of individuals, does not apply to the state, which is a collective agent. A Rawlsian state permits intolerable inequalities and people need to develop a more ambitious view of equality to do justice to the demands of the objective recognition of the reasons of others. For Nagel, honoring the objective point of view demands nothing less.

===Experience as a good in itself===
Nagel has said that "''There are elements [of living] which, if added to one's experience, make life better; there are other elements which if added to one's experience, make life worse. But what remains when these are set aside is not merely neutral: it is emphatically positive.''"&lt;ref&gt;Further; "''Therefore life is worth living even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful, and the good ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.''" 'Death' (essay), Thomas Nagel, CUP, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/the-vise-side-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Nagel received the 1996 [[PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay]] for ''Other Minds'' (1995). He has also been awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] in Moral Philosophy (2008), the [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Rolf Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (2008) and the  Distinguished Achievement Award of the [[Mellon Foundation]] (2006).&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36994">'''Transitional justice''' consists of judicial and non-judicial measures implemented in order to redress legacies of [[human rights]] abuses.  Such measures "include [[criminal prosecution]]s, [[truth commission]]s, [[reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] programs, and various kinds of [[institutional reform]]s".&lt;ref name=ictj&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Transitional Justice?|url=http://ictj.org/about/transitional-justice|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional justice is enacted at a point of political transition from violence and repression to societal stability and it is informed by a society’s desire to rebuild [[Trust (social sciences)|social trust]], repair a fractured justice system, and build a [[Democracy|democratic]] system of governance. The core value of transitional justice is the very notion of justice—which does not necessarily mean criminal justice. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict are thus linked toward a more peaceful, certain, and democratic future.

Transitional justice has recently received greater attention by both academics and policymakers. It has also generated interest in the fields of political and legal discourse, especially in transitional societies. In period of political transitions, from authoritarian, dictatorial regimes or from civil conflicts to democracy, transitional justice has often provided opportunities for such societies to address past human rights abuses, mass atrocities, or other forms of severe trauma in order to facilitate a smooth transition into a more democratic or peaceful future.

==History==
The origins of the transitional justice field can be traced back to the post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] period in [[Europe]] with the establishment of the [[International Military Tribunal]] at [[Nuremberg]] and the various [[de-Nazification]] programs in [[Germany]] and the trials of [[Japan]]ese soldiers at Tokyo Tribunal. What became known as the "[[Nuremberg Trials]]", when the victorious allied forces extended criminal justice to Japanese and German soldiers and their leaders for [[war crimes]] committed during the war, marked the genesis of transitional justice. The field gained momentum and coherence during the 1980s and onwards, beginning with the trials of former members of the military juntas in [[Greece]] (1975), and [[Argentina]] ([[Trial of the Juntas]], 1983). The focus of transitional justice in the 1970s and 1980s was on criminal justice with a focus on [[human rights]] promotion. This led to a worldwide focus and progressive rise of human rights regime culminating in the establishments of international human rights laws and conventions.

The emphasis of transitional justice was on how abuses of human rights get treated during political transition: legal and criminal prosecution. As noted earlier, the universal conceptions of "justice" became the platform on which transitional justice was premised. The field in its early [[epistemology]], thus, assumed jurisprudence of human rights. As a result, the initial literature on transitional justice was dominated by lawyers, law, and legal rights: defining laws, and processes on how to deal with human rights abuse and holding people accountable. Thus, transitional justice has its roots in both the human rights movement and in international human rights and humanitarian law. These origins in the human rights movement have rendered transitional justice “self-consciously victim-centric”.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a shift in the focus of transitional justice. Informed by the worldwide wave of democratization, particularly the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]], transitional justice reemerged as a new field of study in democratization. Transitional justice broadened its scope from more narrow questions of [[jurisprudence]] to political considerations of developing stable democratic institutions and renewing civil society. Studies by scholars on the transition from autocratic regimes to democratic ones have integrated the transitional justice framework into an examination of the political processes inherent to democratic change. The challenges of democratization in transitional periods are many: settling past accounts without derailing democratic progress, developing judicial or third-party fora capable of resolving conflicts, reparations, and creating memorials and developing educational curricula that redress cultural lacunae and unhealed trauma.

It is clear that elements of transitional justice have broken the initial mold of post-war jurisprudence. The transitional justice framework has benefited from democratic activists who sought to bolster fledgling democracies and bring them into line with the moral and legal obligations articulated in the international human rights consensus.

One particular innovation is the appearance of [[truth commission]]s. Beginning with Argentina in 1983, Chile in 1990, and South Africa in 1995, truth commissions have become a symbol of transitional justice, appearing in transitional societies in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. However, several attempts to create a regional truth commission in the former [[Yugoslavia]] (REKOM) have failed due to political obstacles. Recent years have also seen proposals for truth and reconciliation commissions in conflict zones of the Middle East and it is likely that these transitional justice institutions will someday figure prominently in [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[Kurdistan|Kurdish region]]s.{{or|date=September 2015}}

Another major institutional innovation is the appearance of the variety of [[lustration]] programs in Central and Eastern Europe since the 1990s. While most countries pursued programs based on dismissals of compromised personnel and comprehensive screening tools, other countries implemented more inclusive methods allowing discredited personnel a second chance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14845.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As a link between transition and justice, the concept of transitional justice transformed in the late 1940s to assume a broader perspective of comprehensive examination of the society in transition from a retrospective to a prospective position with democratic consolidation as one of the primary objectives. Scholars and practitioners of democratization have come to a common conclusion on the general principles of a transitional justice framework: that national strategies to confront past abuses, depending on the specific nature and context of the country in question, can contribute to accountability, an end to impunity, reconstruct state–citizen relations, and the creation of democratic institutions.

==Objectives==
The primary objective of a transitional justice policy is to end the culture of [[impunity]] and establish the rule of law in a context of democratic governance. The legal and human rights protection roots of transitional justice impute certain legal obligations on states undergoing transitions. It challenges such societies to strive for a society where respect for human rights is the core and accountability is routinely practiced as the main goals. In the context of these goals, transitional justice aims at:

* Halting ongoing human rights abuses;
* Investigating past crimes;
* Identifying those responsible for human rights violations;
* Imposing sanctions on those responsible (where it can);
* Providing reparations to victims;
* Preventing future abuses;
* Security Sector Reform;
* Preserving and enhancing peace; and
* Fostering individual and national reconciliation.

In general, therefore, one can identify eight broad objectives that transitional justice aims to serve: establishing the truth, providing victims a public platform, holding perpetrators accountable, strengthening the rule of law, providing victims with compensation, effectuating institutional reform, promoting reconciliation, and promoting public deliberation.

==Strategies==
In order to be effective, transitional justice measures should be part of a holistic approach. There are five broad strategies or forms of transitional justice:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-transitional-justice "What is Transitional Justice?"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; 1) Criminal prosecutions, 2) Truth commissions, 3) Reparation programs, 4) Security sector reform, 5) Memorialization efforts. The needs of the survivors are essential and including gender justice is necessary to ensure women have equal access to the mechanisms.

==Prosecutions==
{{main|International criminal law}}
The investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes, such as [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crimes]] helps to strengthen the rule of law by sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties. It also demonstrates that crime will not be tolerated, and that human rights abusers will be held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/criminal-justice "Criminal Justice"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; From its historical roots in the [[Nuremberg Trials]], recent examples have included [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], hybrid courts such as [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], [[Special Panels of the Dili District Court]], [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]], [[Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), assuming a [[universal jurisdiction]]. The ICC and Hybrid Courts/Tribunals are key components of prosecution initiatives:

===International Criminal Court===

{{main|International Criminal Court}}
The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] in 1998. It is the first international criminal court that helps end impunity for perpetrators of severe crimes. It was established to investigate and try leaders of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in cases where countries are unable or unwilling to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/Transitions-June-2010 "Transitions June 2010: Transitional Justice News From Around the World"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid courts and tribunals===

Hybrid courts and tribunals have emerged as “third generation” courts established to investigate and prosecute human rights offenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://pict-pcti.org/courts/hybrid.html&lt;/ref&gt; They follow the “first generation” Nuremberg and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo tribunals]] and the “second generation” International Criminal Court and International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia ([[ICTY]]) and Rwanda ([[ICTR]]). These courts consist of both international and domestic justice actors. They attempt to deliver justice that the domestic justice systems cannot provide alone due to lack of capacity or political will. Furthermore, hybrid courts attempt to strengthen domestic capacities to prosecute human rights abuses through the transfer of international legal skills and expertise. Examples include the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] and the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/where-here-international-tribunals "Where to From Here for International Tribunals?"], Caitlin Reiger, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; A step beyond within a more societal and traditional scope of justice could be the [[Gacaca]] for Rwanda.

===Reparations===
{{main|Reparations (transitional justice)}}
Reparations aim to repair the suffering of victims of human rights abuses. They seek to make amends with victims, help them overcome the consequences of abuse, and provide rehabilitation. They may include financial payments, social services including health care or education, or symbolic compensation such as public apologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/reparations-theory-and-practice "Reparations in Theory and Practice"], Lisa Margarrell, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the Canadian government’s apology “Statement of Reconciliation” to indigenous Canadian families for removing their children and placing them in church-run Indian Residential Schools. The Canadian government also created a $350&amp;nbsp;million fund to help those affected by the schools.

===Truth-seeking===
{{main|Truth-seeking}}
Truth-seeking encompasses initiatives allowing actors in a country to investigate past abuses and seek redress for victims. These processes aim to enable societies to examine and come to terms with past crimes and [[human rights]] violations in order to prevent their recurrence. They help create documentation that prevents repressive regimes from rewriting history and denying the past. They can also help victims obtain closure by knowing the truth about what actually happened (such as to “disappeared” people) and understanding the atrocities they endured. Truth-seeking measures may include [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information legislation]], declassification of archives, investigations, and truth commissions.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory  "Truth and Memory"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Truth commissions====
{{main|Truth commissions}}
Truth commissions are non-judicial commissions of inquiry that aim to discover and reveal past abuses by a government or non-state actors; about forty official truth commissions have been created worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/truth-commissions  "Truth Commissions"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa]], which was established to help overcome apartheid and reconcile tensions in the country.

===Memory and memorials===
{{main|Memorialization}}
Memorials seek to preserve memories of people or events. In the context of transitional justice, they serve to honor those who died during conflict or other atrocities, examine the past, address contemporary issues and show respect to victims. They can help create records to prevent denial and help societies move forward. Memorials may include commemoration activities, such as architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"/&gt; One example includes the monuments, annual prayer ceremony, and mass grave in northern [[Uganda]], created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/we-can%E2%80%99t-be-sure-who-killed-us-memory-and-memorialization-post-conflict-northern-uganda  "We Can’t Be Sure Who Killed Us: Memory and Memorialization in Post-conflict Northern Uganda"], Julian Hopwood, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional reform===
{{main|Security sector reform}}
Public institutions, including the [[police]], [[military]], and [[judiciary]], often contribute to repression and other human rights violations. When societies undergo a transition, these institutions must be reformed in order to create accountability and prevent the recurrence of abuse. Institutional reform includes the process of restructuring these state actors to ensure that they respect human rights and abide by the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/institutional-reform "Institutional Reform"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms can include measures such as [[vetting]], [[lustration]], and [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration]] (DDR). Vetting is the process of eliminating corrupt or abusive officials from public service employment. For instance, in [[Afghanistan]], election candidates in the 2009 and 2010 elections were vetted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/vetting-lessons-2009-10-elections-afghanistan "Vetting Lessons for the 2009-10 Elections in Afghanistan"], Fatima Ayub, Antonella Deledda, Patricia Gossman, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; While similar to lustration, "vetting" is the broader category referring to processes aimed at screening and excluding human rights abusers from public institutions while "lustration" refers specifically to the vetting processes and laws that were implemented in the former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe after the end of  the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/justice-prevention-vetting-public-employees-transitional-societies "Justice as Prevention: Vetting Public Employees in Transitional Societies"], eds. Pablo de Greiff and Alexander Mayer-Rieckh, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; Vetting does not necessarily imply dismissals from the state apparatus. Several countries developed alternative personnel systems that provide for the inclusion of inherited personnel in exchange for their exposure or confession.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, David, ''Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; DDR programs assist ex‑combatants in rejoining society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/research/disarmament-demobilization-and-reintegration "Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of institutional reform is the removal of court officials involved in crimes of the fallen Tunisian regime. Under [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]’s rule, courts often facilitated corruption. The removal of implicated officials is a part of the government’s efforts to reconcile this abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/news/tunisias-courts-emerge-slowly-shadow-ben-ali "Tunisia's courts Emerge Slowly from Shadow of Ben Ali"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends and challenges==
States in times of transition to democracy, since the early 1980s, have been using a variety of transitional justice mechanisms as part of measures to account for the past and build a future democratic state. Mechanisms, such as trials, truth commissions, reparations, lustration, museums, and other memory sites have been employed either single-handedly or in a combined form to address past human rights violations. Diverse studies ranging from the decision-making process of a choice of strategy through to the implementation of the transitional justice policy and impacts on the transition and future stability of the society in question have been produced by scholars in recent years. One illuminating study in particular that has documented the dramatic new trend of transitional justice and democratization is by Kathryn Sikkink and Carrie Booth Walling (2006). In their research paper described as the "justice cascade", Sikkink and Walling conducting analysis of truth commissions and human rights trials occurring throughout the world from 1979 to 2004 revealed a significant increase in the judicialization of world politics both regionally and internationally. Of the 192 countries surveyed, 34 have used truth commissions, and 50 had at least one transitional human rights trial.

More than two-thirds of the approximately 85 new and/or transitional countries during that period used either trials or truth commissions as a transitional justice mechanism; over half tried some form of judicial proceedings. Thus, the use of a truth commission and/or human rights trials among transitional countries is not an isolated or marginal practice, but a widespread social practice occurring in the bulk of transitional countries.

Since its emergence, transitional justice has encountered numerous challenges such as identifying victims, deciding whether to punish superiors or middle agents, avoiding a "victor’s justice", and finding adequate resources for compensation, trial, or institutional reform. Also, the transitional period may only result in a tenuous peace or fragile democracy. As has been noted in the discourse on transition to democracy, the dilemma has always been for new regimes to promote accountability for past abuses without risking a smooth transition to democracy. In addition, existing judicial system might be weak, [[Political corruption|corrupt]], or ineffective and in effect make achieving any viable justice difficult. Observers of transitional justice application and processes, such as [[Makau W. Mutua]] (2000) emphasized on the difficulties of achieving actual justice through one of the most prominent mechanisms of transitional justice, trials. Commenting on the international tribunal established in [[Rwanda]] in 1994, he argued that it “serves to deflect responsibility, to assuage the consciences of states which were unwilling to stop the [[genocide]]... [and] largely masks the illegitimacy of the [[Tutsi]] regime”. In sum, Matua argues that criminal tribunals such as those in Rwanda and Yugoslavia are “less meaningful if they cannot be applied or enforced without prejudice to redress transgressions or unless they have a deterrent effect such as behavior modification on the part of would be perpetrators”.

More recently, [[Lyal S. Sunga]] has argued that unless truth commissions are set up and conducted according to international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, they risk conflicting or undermining criminal prosecutions, whether these prosecutions are supposed to be carried out at the national or international levels. He contends that this risk is particularly pronounced where truth commissions employ amnesties, and especially blanket amnesties to pardon perpetrators of serious crimes. On the other hand, criminal prosecutions should be better tailored to focus on victims and to place events in proper perspective.  Sunga therefore proposes ten principles for making truth and national reconciliation commissions fully complementary to criminal prosecutions in a way that conforms fully to international law.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Principles for Reconciling Truth Commissions and Criminal Prosecutions, in ''The Legal Regime of the ICC'', Brill (2009) 1071–1104.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of critique of transitional justice mechanisms could cause some scholars and policymakers to wonder which of the objectives outlined above are most important to achieve, and even if they are achievable. Truth commissions could be characterized as a second-best alternative and also an affront to rule of law, because of the possibility that amnesty and indemnities will be made exchange for truth. These sets of challenges can raise critical questions for transitional justice in its application. Questions and issues, such as: Can the "truth" ever really be established? Can all victims be given compensation or a public platform? Can all perpetrators be held accountable? Or is it sufficient to acknowledge that atrocities were committed and that victims should be compensated for their suffering?

Also, one might argue that too narrow a focus on the challenges of the field runs the risk of making transitional justice seem meaningless. However transitional justice aims at an ongoing search for truth, justice, forgiveness, and healing, and efforts undertaken within it help people to live alongside former enemies. Simply put, “the past must be addressed in order to reach the future”. Thus, even if the impact or reach of transitional justice seems marginal, the end result is worth the effort.

Another way of assessing attempts at transitional justice is to say that decision makers may have less control over the methods used to pursue such policies than they imagine. In fact, whatever their wishes, they may not be able to prevent such policies at all. As A.&amp;nbsp;James McAdams has demonstrated in his book, ''Judging the Past in Unified Germany'' (2001), West German policymakers such as former chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] wanted to close public access to the files of East Germany's secret police, the [[Stasi]], but pressures from East German dissidents prevented them from doing so.

Another challenge is the tension between peace and justice, which arises the conflicting goals of achieving peace and justice in the aftermath of a society’s emergence from conflict. Though it is generally unanimous that both goals are integral to achieving reconciliation, practitioners often disagree about which goal should be pursued first: justice or peace?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104175556/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the “justice” school of thought argue that if all perpetrators of human rights abuses do not stand trial, impunity for crimes will continue into the new regime, preventing it from fully completing a transition from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/18/seductions-sequencing&lt;/ref&gt; The "peace" school of thought, however, argues that the only way to effectively end violence is by granting amnesties and brokering negotiations to persuade criminals to lay down their arms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/744] Examples such as [[Northern Ireland]] illustrate how selective amnesties can cease conflict.

Recent trends in the post-conflict field have tended to favor the “justice” school of thought, maintaining that only if justice is dutifully served to victims of the conflict can civil war will be prevented from recurring. A 2011 debate in ''[[The Economist]]'' determined in its concluding polls that 76% of the debate participants agreed with the motion that achieving peace can occur only through implementing justice mechanisms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/747]

=== Literary Applications ===
Literary scholars and historians have begun to use the concept of transitional justice to reexamine historical events and texts. Christopher N. Warren, for instance, has applied transitional justice to pre-[[Restoration England]], claiming that it helps explain how Anglican royalists convinced Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren also argues that English poet [[John Milton]] “can be seen as an early critic of transitional justice,” using the allegory of Sin and Death in his epic poem [[Paradise Lost]] to complicate “overly-rosy” depictions of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''. p. 5, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future agenda==
Although transitional justice is engulfed by many critical challenges in addition to the difficulty in measuring its impact, given the number of other factors in any given country’s experience over time, human rights trials or truth commissions need not have a negative effect on human rights practices. This makes transitional justice viable, especially in this age of state-building and democracy promotion in post-conflict societies. In fact, Sikkink and Walling’s comparison of human rights conditions before and after trials in [[Latin America]]n countries with two or more trial years showed that eleven of the fourteen countries had better Political Terror Scale (PTS) ratings after trials. Latin American countries that had both a truth commission and human rights trials improved more on their PTS ratings than countries that only had trials. These statistics indicate that transitional justice mechanisms are associated with countries’ improving their human rights practices. Each state that employs transitional justice mechanisms will have to determine which mechanisms to use to best achieve the targeted goals. In order to avoid causing disappointment amongst victims, the state should also ensure that the public is well-informed about the goals and limits of those mechanisms.

Transitional justice shows no signs of decreasing in use. Indeed, the incorporation of transitional justice policies, tools and programs in peacebuilding and democratization process operations by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and in the programs by many local and international democracy promotion organizations, including, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Electoral Assistance and Democracy (International IDEA) and a host of others as well as the establishments of other international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and networks such as the [http://www.ictj.org International Center for Transitional Justice] (ICTJ) and the  [http://www.transitionaljustice.net African Transitional Justice Research Network] (ATJRN) and research centers like the [[Transitional Justice Institute]] are strong manifestations of how well placed transitional justice has become a feature in the discourse of transitional politics in the 21st century. Academic publications such as the [http://www.ijtj.oxfordjournals.org International Journal of Transitional Justice] are also contributing towards building an interdisciplinary field with the hope that future innovations are tailored for a specific state’s situation and will contribute towards political transitions that address the past as well as establish guarantees for respect of human rights and democracy.

The [[World Bank]]'s "2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security, and Development” links transitional justice to security and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/human-rights-and-transitional-justice-2011-world-development-report "Human Rights and Transitional Justice in the 2011 World Development Report"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; It explores how countries can avoid cycles of violence and emphasizes the importance of transitional justice, arguing that it is one of the “[[Signalling (economics)|signaling mechanisms]]” that governments can use to show that they are breaking away from past practices. It also argues that transitional justice measures can send signals about the importance of accountability and to improve institutional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext "Conflict, Security, and Development"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514143518/http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext |date=2011-05-14 }}, ''World Development Report 2011''&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) published a report advocating the need to understand traditional transitional justice measures from a child's perspective. The report identifies children as a large demographic too often excluded from traditional transitional justice measures. In order to correct this imbalance, a new child-centered perspective is needed to incorporate children into the larger scope of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/through-new-lens-child-sensitive-approach-transitional-justice "Through A New Lens: A Child-Sensitive Approach to Transitional Justice"], "International Center for Transitional Justice"&lt;/ref&gt;
