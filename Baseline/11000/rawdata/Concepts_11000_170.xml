==Motivation of perpetrators==
The intention of the attacker is often to humiliate rather than to kill the victim. In Britain such attacks, particularly those against men, are believed to be underreported, and as a result many of them do not show up in official statistics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Some of the most common motivations of perpetrators include:
* Personal conflict regarding intimate relationships, and sexual rejection&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673610618636/fulltext?rss=yes|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|issue=9748|page=1209|accessdate=20 April 2016 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61863-6|year=2010|last1=Solberg|first1=Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; 
* Racial motivations
* Sexual related jealousy and lust&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 February 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=6 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social, political and religious motivations
* Gang violence and rivalry
* Attacks against minorities
* Conflicts over land ownership, farm animals, housing and property&lt;ref name=Bahl_Syed/&gt;
* Revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of [[marriage]] and demands for [[dowry]]&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay_Khan" /&gt;

Acid attacks often occur as revenge against a woman who rejects a proposal of marriage or a sexual advance.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title=How many acid attacks are there? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23631395 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=6a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mannan|first=A.|author2=S.

Attacks against individuals based on their religious beliefs or social or political activities also occur. These attacks may be targeted against a specific individual, due to their activities, or may be perpetrated against random persons merely because they are part of a social group or community. In Europe, [[Konstantina Kouneva]], currently a member of the [[European Parliament]], had acid thrown on her in 2008, in what was described as "the most severe assault on a trade unionist in Greece for 50 years."&lt;ref name=kk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/opinion/0000/00/00/1819/|title=Kuneva case – the most severe assault on trade unionist in Greece for 50 years|work=FOCUS Information Agency|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female students have had acid thrown in their faces as a punishment for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/03/world/asia/pakistan-acid-attack/|title=Pakistani Taliban target female students with acid attack|author=Shaan Khan, CNN|date=3 November 2012|work=CNN|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid attacks due to [[religious conflicts]] have been also reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themediaproject.org/article/acid-attack-injures-roman-catholic-priest-tanzania?page=full|title=Acid attack injures Catholic priest|work=The Media Project|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24088096|title=Catholic priest targeted in acid attack in Zanzibar|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both males and females have been victims of acid attacks for refusing to convert to another religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/christian-woman-throws-acid-on-hindu-ex-boyfriend-after-he-refuses-to-convert-269758.html|title=26YO Woman Throws Acid On Ex-Boyfriend After He Refused To Convert To Her Religion For Marriage|work=indiatimes.com|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicts regarding property issues, land disputes, and inheritance have also been reported as motivations of acid attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4329733.stm|title=BBC NEWS – South Asia – Dhaka men in acid attacks protest|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6758023/ACID_VIOLENCE_A_BURNING_IMPACT_ON_WOMEN_OF_BANGLADESH-CASE_STUDY|title=ACID VIOLENCE: A BURNING IMPACT ON WOMEN OF BANGLADESH-CASE STUDY|author=Garph Publication|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid attacks related to conflicts between criminal [[gangs]] occur in many places, including the UK, Greece, and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/acid-attacks-intensify-indonesia-gang-fights-132345946.html|title=Acid attacks intensify Indonesia gang fights|website=En-maktoob.news.yahoo.com|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24835910|title=Acid attacks on men related to gang violence, say experts|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, anecdotal evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as [[South America]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; However, [[South Asia]]n countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

Police in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are afraid to come forward to report attacks, meaning the true scale of the problem may be unknown.&lt;ref name=telegraph_policestats&gt;{{cite news|title=True scale of acid attacks hidden as victims too scared to come forward, police say|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/22/partner-towie-star-wanted-nightclub-acid-attack-thought-have/|date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
An accurate estimate of the gender ratio of victims and perpetrators is difficult to establish because many acid attacks are not reported or recorded by authorities. According to a 2010 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'', there are "no reliable statistics" on the prevalence of acid attacks in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A 2007 literature review analyzed 24 studies in 13 countries over the past 40 years, covering 771 cases.&lt;ref name=3a/&gt; According to the London-based charity Acid Survivors Trust International 60% of acid attacks are on women, and acid assaults are grossly under-estimated. In some regions, assaults perpetrated on female victims by males are often driven by the mentality "If I can't have you, no one shall."&lt;ref&gt;Bhalla, Nita (9 July 2013) [http://www.trust.org/item/20130709160626-j5dfo/?source=dpagehead India's top court says gov't not trying to stop acid attacks]. ''Thomson Reuters Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangladesh, throwing acid has been labeled as a "gender crime", as there is a dominance of female victims who are assaulted by males, for the reason of refusing to marry, or refusing sexual advances from male perpetrators&lt;ref name="kln.ac.lk"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.05.002|pmid=17095164|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-02-06|title=Cases of chemical assault worldwide: A literature review|journal=Burns|volume=33|issue=2|page=149|year=2007|last1=Mannan|first1=Ashim|last2=Ghani|first2=Samuel|last3=Clarke|first3=Alex|last4=Butler|first4=Peter E.M.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In Jamaica, women throwing acid on other women in relation to fights over male partners is a common cause.&lt;ref name="kln.ac.lk"/&gt; In the UK, the majority of victims are men, and many of these attacks are related to gang violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another factor that puts victims at increased risk for an acid assault is their [[socioeconomic status]], as those living in [[poverty]] are more likely to be attacked.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; {{as of|2013}}, the three nations with the most noted incidence of acid attacks – Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia – were ranked 75th, 101st, and 104th, respectively, out of 136 countries on the [[Global Gender Gap]] Index, a scale that measures equality in opportunities between men and women in nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2013.pdf|title=The Global Gender Gap report|website=3.weforum.org|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The UK has one of highest rates of acid attacks in the world, according to the police. An average of [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/acid-attacks-uk-highest-world-figures-police-revealed-a8098236.html two attacks a day] are recorded by forces across the country.

In 2016, the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in London recorded 454 attacks involving corrosive fluids in the city, with 261 in the previous year, indicating a rise of 36%. A rise of 30% was also recorded in the UK as a whole.&lt;ref name="telegraph_policestats2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/22/partner-towie-star-wanted-nightclub-acid-attack-thought-have/|title=True scale of acid attacks hidden as victims too scared to come forward, police say|date=22 April 2017|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39328233|title=Sharp rise in attacks involving corrosive fluids in London|date=20 March 2017|access-date=2 June 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005–06 and 2011–12 the number of assaults involving acid throwing and other corrosive substances tripled in England, official records show. NHS hospital figures record 144 assaults in 2011–12 involving corrosive substances, which can include petrol, bleach and kerosene. Six years earlier, 56 such episodes were noted.

===Mexico===
Drug cartels such as the [[Los Zetas]] are known to use acid on civilians. For example, In the [[2011 San Fernando massacre]], Los Zetas members took away children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the civilians in a bus. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten. Screams of the women and of the children being put in acid were also heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2011/288998/6/de-frente-y-de-perfil.htm|title=De frente y de perfil|work=El Informador :: Noticias de Jalisco, México, Deportes &amp; Entretenimiento|access-date=2018-04-04|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Asia===
In South Asia, acid attacks have been used as a form of revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of [[marriage]] and demands for [[dowry]].&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay_Khan" /&gt; Scholars Taru Bahl and M.H.

Acid attacks are often referred to as a "[[crime of passion]]", fueled by jealousy and revenge.&lt;ref name=3a /&gt; Actual cases though, show that they are usually the result of rage at a woman who rebuffs the advances of a male. For the country of Bangladesh, such passion is often rooted in [[marriage]] and relationships. One study showed that refusal of [[marriage proposal]]s accounted for 55% of acid assaults, with abuse from a husband or other family member (18%), property disputes (11%) and refusal of sexual or romantic advances (2%) as other leading causes.&lt;ref name="6a"/&gt; Additionally, the use of acid attacks in dowry arguments has been reported in Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; with 15% of cases studied by the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] citing dowry disputes as the motive.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=Anwary1&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anwary | first = Afroza | date = 2002 | title = Acid Violence And Medical Care In Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework |journal= Gender &amp; Society | pages = 305–313 | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1177/0891243202250851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acid attacks in India, like Bangladesh, have a gendered aspect to them: analyses of news reports revealed at least 72% of reported attacks  included at least one female victim.&lt;ref name="12a2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/AvonGlobalCenterforWomenandJustice.pdf|title=Combating Acid Violence In Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia|authors=Avon Global Center for Women and Justice at Cornell Law School, Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City bar Association, Cornell Law School international Human Rights Clinic, and the Virtue Foundation|year=2011|publisher=Avon Foundation for Women|pages=1–64|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Bangladesh, India's incidence rate of chemical assault has been increasing in the past decade, with a high 27 reported cases in 2010.&lt;ref name="12a2" /&gt; Altogether, from January 2002 to October 2010, 153 cases of acid assault were reported in Indian print media&lt;ref name="12a2" /&gt; while 174 judicial cases were reported for the year of 2000.&lt;ref name="9a2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=N.|date=September 2011|title=Acid attacks on women: An appraisal of the Indian legal response|journal=Asia Pacific Journal on Human Rights and the Law|volume=12|issue=2|pages=55–72|doi=10.1163/138819011X13215419937940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation behind acid attacks in India mirrors those in Bangladesh: a study of Indian news reports from  January 2002 to October 2010 uncovered that victims’ rejected sex or marriage proposals motivated attacks in 35% of the 110 news stories providing a motive for the attack.&lt;ref name="12a2" /&gt; Notable cases of acid attacks are [[Sonali Mukherjee]]'s case of 2003 and [[Laxmi Agarwal]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beaninspirer.com/laxmi-agarwal-brave-acid-attack-victim-presenting-hope-acid-attack-victims/|title=Laxmi Agarwal – A Brave Acid Attack Victim who is presenting hope to all of the Acid-attack Victims|date=2016-12-05|work=Be An Inspirer|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2002 riots in Gujarat]], targeted violence against Muslim women and children documented by civil society groups reported "mass rapes, live burials and burnings, acid attacks, impaling, and other brutal forms of torture that was deeply gendered, and linked violence against women with violence on their children – both born and unborn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children and Violence – Politics of Conflict in South Asia|last1=Jacob|first1=Cecilia|date=October 2016|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9781107117242|editor1-last=D'Costa|editor1-first=Bina|page=203|chapter=Children Affected by Political Violence in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kandhamal riots|2008 Kandhamal Riots]], more than 100 Christians were gang-raped, disemboweled, burned alive and had acid thrown to their faces by [[Hindu extremism|Hindu extremists]] for refusing to convert.

Police in India are also known to use acid on individuals, particularly on their eyes, causing blindness to the victims. A well known such case is the [[1980 Bhagalpur blindings|Bhagalpur blindings]], where police blinded 31 individuals under trial (or convicted criminals, according to some versions) by pouring acid into their eyes. The incident was widely discussed, debated and acutely criticized by several human rights organizations. The Bhagalpur blinding case had made criminal jurisprudence history by becoming the first in which the Indian Supreme Court ordered compensation for violation of basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19801231-bhagalpur-blindings-represents-one-of-the-darkest-chapters-in-indias-history-773650-2013-11-29|title=Bhagalpur blindings represents one of the darkest chapters in India's history|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
According to ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Nicholas D. Kristof]], acid attacks are at an all-time high in Pakistan and increasing every year. The Pakistani attacks he describes are typically the work of husbands against their wives who have "[[Honor killing|dishonored them]]."&lt;ref name="video.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| title=Acid Attacks |url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2008/11/29/opinion/1194834033797/acid-attack.html | work=The New York Times | first=Rob | last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics compiled by the [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] (HRCP) show that 46 acid attacks occurred in Pakistan during 2004 and decreased with only 33 acid assaults reported for 2007.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; According to a ''New York Times'' article, in 2011 there were 150 acid attacks in Pakistan, up from 65 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/world/asia/hope-in-pakistan-for-curbing-acid-attacks.html?pagewanted=all|title= After Suicide, New Focus on Acid Attacks in Pakistan|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2012-04-10|first=Declan|last=Walsh}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, estimates by the [[Human Rights Watch]] and the HRCP cite the number of acid attack victims to be as high 400–750 per year.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; Motivation behind acid assaults range from [[marriage proposal]] rejections to [[religious fundamentalism]].&lt;ref name=13a /&gt;

===East Asia and Southeast Asia===
{{see also|Hong Kong acid attacks}}

====China====
The [[Hong Kong acid attacks|Mong Kok acid attacks]] were incidents in 2008, 2009, and 2010 where plastic bottles filled with [[corrosive]] liquid ([[drain cleaner]]) were thrown onto shoppers on [[Sai Yeung Choi Street]] South, Hong Kong, a pedestrian street and popular shopping area. A reward, originally [[HK$]]100,000, for information about the perpetrator or perpetrators, was raised to [[HK$]]300,000 following the second incident, and cameras were to be installed in the area following the December incident. The third incident occurred the very day the cameras were turned on. The fifth incident happened after Hong Kong government announced its new strategies against the incident. 130 people were injured in these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/6961804/Hong-Kong-acid-attack-man-arrested-after-tourists-targeted.html|title=Hong Kong acid attack: man arrested after tourists targeted|last=Eimer|first=David|date=2010|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cambodia====
Recent studies on acid attacks in Cambodia found the victims were almost equally likely to be men or women (48.4% men, 51.6% women).&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; As with [[India]], rates of acid attacks in Cambodia have generally increased in the past decades, with a high rate of 40 cases reported for 2000 that started the increasing trend.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; According to the [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]], 216 acid attacks were reported from 1985 to 2009, with 236 reported victims.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Jealousy and hate is the biggest motivator for acid attacks in Cambodia, as 28% of attacks reported those emotions as the cause.

A particularly high-profile case of this nature was the attack on Cambodian teenager [[Tat Marina]] in 1999, allegedly carried out by the jealous wife of a government official (the incident prompted a rash of [[copycat crime]]s that year, raising the number from seven in 1998 to 40 in 1999).

Acid attacks are common in Vietnam although not to the level of countries such as Pakistan and India.

{{Further|Acid attacks on women in Isfahan}}
According to [[Afshin Molavi]], in the early years of the revolution and following the mandating of the covering of hair by women in Iran, some women were threatened with acid attacks by Islamic vigilantes for failing to wear [[hijab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Molavi |first=Afshin|title=The Soul of Iran: A Nation's Journey to Freedom|year=2005|publisher=W.

Recently, acid assault in [[Iran]] has been met with increased sanctions. The [[Sharia]] ''code of qisas'', or equivalence justice, required a caught perpetrator of acid violence to pay a fine and may be blinded with acid in both eyes.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; Under Iranian law, victims or their families can ask a court's permission to enact "qisas" either by taking the perpetrator's life in murder cases or afflicting an equal injury to his or her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mans-eye-gouged-out-in-iran-under-sharia-eye-for-eye-retribution-law-for-acid-attack-10091523.html|title=A man has had his eye gouged out as a legal punishment in Iran|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; One victim, [[Ameneh Bahrami]], sentenced her attacker to be blinded in 2008.

In October 2014, a series of acid attacks on women occurred in the city of [[Isfahan]], resulting in demonstrations and arrests of journalists who had covered the attacks.

"Relationship conflicts" caused 35% of acid attacks in Uganda in 1985–2011, followed by property conflicts at 8%, and business conflicts at 5%.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; Disaggregated data was not available in the Nigeria study, but they reported that 71% of acid assaults resulted from an argument with either a jilted lover, family member, or business partner.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt; As with the other nations, researchers believe these statistics to be under-representative of the actual scope and magnitude of acid attacks in African nations.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt;

In August 2013, two Jewish women volunteer teachers—Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup from the UK—were injured by an acid attack by men on a moped near Stone Town in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/zanzibar-acid-attack-recap-updates-2143076|title=Zanzibar acid attack: Recap updates as British teenagers Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup land back in Britain|date=2013-08-09|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
On January 17, 2013,  [[Russia]]n ballet dancer [[Sergei Filin]] was attacked with acid by an unknown assailant, who cornered him outside of his home in Moscow. He suffered third-degree burns to his face and neck. While it was initially reported that he was in danger of losing his eyesight, his physicians stated on January 21, 2013 that he would retain eyesight in one eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/celebrity/2013/01/21/bolshoi-ballet-chief-regaining-sight-after-acid-attack|title=TimesLIVE|website=Timeslive.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unidentified Russia woman allegedly attacked men on public transportation for "[[manspreading]]".

=== Ukraine ===
On July 31, 2018, [[Kateryna Handziuk]], an anti-corruption activist and political advisor from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, was attacked with sulfuric acid outside her home by an unknown attacker. She died of her injuries on November 3, 2018. She was 33 years old. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.hromadske.ua/posts/ukrainian-activist-and-whistleblower-official-dies-after-acid-attack&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rferl.org/a/ukrainian-activist-doused-with-acid-dies/29581875.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
'''Colombia'''[[File:Natalia Ponce de Leon IWOC 2.jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Ponce de León]] (right), survivor of a 2014 acid attack, receiving an award for her activism for other survivors]]
Though comprehensive statistics on acid attacks in [[South America]] are sparse, a recent study investigating acid assault in [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]], provides some insight for this region. According to the article, the first identified survivor of acid violence in Bogota was attacked 15 years ago. Since then reported cases have been increasing with time. The study also cited the Colombian Forensics Institute, which reported that 56 women complained of aggression by acid in 2010, 46 in 2011, and 16 during the first trimester of 2012. The average age of survivors was about 23 years old, but ranged from 13 to 41 years.&lt;ref name=15a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Linda|title=Burns due to acid assaults in Bogotá, Colombia|journal=Burns|date=October 2012|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2012.10.022|volume=39|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study reported a male:female victim ratio of 1:30 for acid assault in Bogota, Colombia, although recent reports show the ratio is closer to 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.las2orillas.co/hay-456-hombres-en-colombia-que-tambien-son-natalia-ponce/ | work=las2orillas | title=Hay 456 hombres en Colombia que también son Natalia Ponce | date=2014-04-10 | accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons behind these attacks usually stemmed from poor interpersonal relationships and domestic intolerance toward women. Moreover, female victims usually came from low [[socioeconomic class]]es and had low education. The authors state that the prevalence of acid attacks in other areas of South America remains unknown due to significant underreporting.&lt;ref name=15a /&gt;

On March 27, 2014, a woman named [[Natalia Ponce de León]] was assaulted by Jonathan Vega, who threw a liter of [[sulphuric acid]] on her face and body. Vega, a former neighbor, was reported to have been "obsessed" with Ponce de León and had been making death threats against her after she turned down his proposal for a relationship.&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"/&gt; 24% of her body was severely burned as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia: Man accused of high profile acid attack arrested.

Retrieved from: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26906638&lt;/ref&gt; Ponce de León has undergone 15 [[Reconstructive surgery|reconstruction surgeries]] on her face and body since the attack.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/victim-horrific-acid-attack-removes-7209404|title=Victim of acid attack removes her mask to reveal her face for the first time|first=Winnie|last=Agbonlahor|date=20 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/11/survivors-of-acid-attacks-in-Colombia-fight-for-justice.html|title=Survivors of acid attacks in Colombia fight for justice|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years before the attack took place, [[Colombia]] reported one of the highest rates of [[acid attack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fucsia.co/personajes/nacionales/article/colombia-lider-vergonzoso-en-ataques-con-acido/49533|title=Colombia, líder vergonzoso en ataques con ácido|website=Fucsia.co|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was not an effective law in place until Ponce de León's campaign took off in the months after her attack. The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases [[Sentence (law)|maximum sentences]] to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3"/&gt; The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy. Ponce de León expressed hope that the new law would act as a deterrent against future attacks.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3" /&gt;

==Health effects==
The most notable effect of an acid attack is the lifelong bodily disfigurement. According to the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] in [[Pakistan]], there is a high survival rate amongst victims of acid attacks. Consequently, the victim is faced with physical challenges, which require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which require in-depth intervention from [[psychologist]]s and counselors at each stage of physical recovery.&lt;ref name=ASF&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Adnan|title=The real miracle workers fighting, and healing, Pakistan’s acid attacks|url=http://acidsurvivorspakistan.org/|publisher=Acid Survivors Foundation, Pakistan|date=Apr 21, 2012|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These far-reaching effects on their lives impact their psychological, social and economic viability in communities.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;

===Medical===
The medical effects of acid attacks are extensive. As a majority of acid attacks are aimed at the face,&lt;ref name="3a" /&gt; several articles thoroughly reviewed the medical implications for these victims. The severity of the damage depends on the [[concentration]] of the acid and the time before the acid is thoroughly washed off with water or [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] with a neutralizing agent. The acid can rapidly eat away skin, the layer of fat beneath the skin, and in some cases even the underlying bone. Eyelids and lips may be completely destroyed and the nose and ears severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|title=Gender-Based Violence In Public Places: Acid Throwing|author=Keerthi Bollineni|publisher=[[Centre for Equality and Inclusion]]|access-date=2012-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526012923/http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not exhaustive, Acid Survivors Foundation Uganda findings included:&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt;
* The [[skull]] is partly destroyed/deformed and hair lost.
* [[Ear]] cartilage is usually partly or totally destroyed; [[deafness]] may occur.
* [[Eyelids]] may be burned off or deformed, leaving the [[eye]]s extremely dry and prone to [[blindness]]. Acid directly in the eye also damages [[eyesight|sight]], sometimes causing blindness in both eyes.
* The [[nose]] can become shrunken and deformed; the [[nostril]]s may close off completely due to destroyed [[cartilage]].
* The [[mouth]] becomes shrunken and narrow, and it may lose its full range of motion. Sometimes, the [[lip]]s may be partly or totally destroyed, exposing the [[teeth]]. Eating and speaking can become difficult.
* [[Scar]]s can run down from the [[chin]] to [[neck]] area, shrinking the chin and extremely limiting [[range of motion]] in the neck.
* [[Inhalation]] of acid vapors usually creates [[respiratory]] problems, exacerbated restricted [[airway]] pathways (the [[esophagus]] and [[nostril]]s) in acid patients.

In addition to these above-mentioned medical effects, acid attack victims face the possibility of [[septicemia]], [[renal failure]], skin [[depigmentation]], and even death.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt;

A 2015 attack that involved throwing sulfuric acid on a man's face and body while he lay in bed caused him, among other serious injuries, to become paralyzed from the neck down.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/berlinah-wallace-jailed-years-sadistic-acid-attack-mark-van-dongen?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
Acid assault survivors face many [[mental health]] issues upon recovery. One study showed that when compared to published Western [[norm (social)|norms]] for psychological well-being, non-Caucasian acid attack victims reported higher levels of [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and scored higher on the Derriford appearance scale, which measures [[psychological distress]] due to one's concern for their appearance. Additionally, female victims reported lowered [[self-esteem]] according to the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg scale]] and increased [[self-consciousness]], both in general and in the social sphere.&lt;ref name=6a /&gt;

===Social===
In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; For example, such attacks usually leave victims [[handicapped]] in some way, rendering them dependent on either their spouse or family for everyday activities, such as eating and running errands. These dependencies are increased by the fact that many acid survivors are not able to find suitable work, due to impaired vision and [[Physical disability|physical handicap]]. This negatively impacts their economic viability, causing hardships on the families/spouses that care for them. As a result, divorce rates are high, with abandonment by husbands found in 25% of acid assault cases in [[Uganda]] (compared to only 3% of wives abandoning their disfigured husbands).&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; Moreover, acid survivors who are single when attacked almost certainly become [[social rejection|ostracized]] from society, effectively ruining marriage prospects.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; Some media outlets overwhelmingly avoid reporting acid attack violence, or the description of the attack is laconic or often implies that the act was inevitable or even justified.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Halim and Marian Meyers (2010), ''News Coverage of Violence Against Muslim Women: A View From the Arabian Gulf'', Communication, Culture &amp; Critique. Volume 3, Issue 1, pages 85–104, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment for burn victims remains inadequate in many [[developing nation]]s where incidence is high. Medical underfunding has resulted in very few [[burn center]]s available for victims in countries such as Uganda,&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt; Bangladesh,&lt;ref name="7a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faga|first=A.|author2=D. Scevolab|author3=M.G. Mezzettic|author4=S. Scevolaa|title=Sulphuric acid burned women in Bangladesh: A social and medical problem|journal=Burns|volume=26|issue=8|pages=701–709|doi=10.1016/S0305-4179(00)00049-8|date=20 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambodia.&lt;ref name="11a" /&gt; For example, Uganda has one specialized [[burn center]] in the entire nation, which opened in 2003;&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt; likewise, Cambodia has only one burn facility for victims,&lt;ref name="11a" /&gt; and scholars estimate that only 30% of the Bangladeshi community has access to [[health care]].&lt;ref name="7a" /&gt;

In addition to inadequate medical capabilities, many acid assault victims fail to report to the [[police]] due to a lack of trust in the force, a sense of hopelessness due to the attackers' [[impunity]], and a fear of male brutality in dealing with their cases.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; Most of the female victims suffer more because of police apathy in dealing with cases of harassment as safety issues as victims refused to register a police case despite being attacked thrice before meriting police aid after an acid attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2854918.ece A case of police apathy?], ''The Hindu'', February 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of how to treat burns: many victims applied oil to the acid, rather than rinsing thoroughly and completely with water for 30 minutes or longer to [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the acid. Such [[home remedy|home remedies]] only serve to increase the severity of damage, as they do not counteract the acidity.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt;

==Prevention==
Research has prompted many solutions to the increasing incidence of acid attacks in the world. Many countries look to Bangladesh, whose rates of attack have been decreasing, as a model, following their lead in many legislative reforms.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; However, several reports highlighted the need for an increased, legal role of NGOs to offer rehabilitation support to acid survivors.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Additionally, nearly all research stressed the need for stricter [[regulation]] of acid sales to combat this social issue.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;&lt;ref name=10a /&gt;&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

===Role of NGOs===
Many [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed in the areas with the highest occurrence of acid attacks to combat such attacks. Bangladesh has its [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], which offers acid victims [[legal]], [[medical]], [[rehabilitation counseling|counseling]], and monetary assistance in rebuilding their lives.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; Similar institutions exist in Uganda, which has its own Acid Survivors Foundation,&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; and in Cambodia which uses the help of [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]].&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; NGOs provide rehabilitation services for survivors while acting as advocates for [[social reform]], hoping to increase support and awareness for acid assault.

In Bangladesh, the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], Nairpokkho, [[Action Aid]], and the [[Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee]]'s Community Empowerment &amp; Strengthening Local Institutions Programme assist survivors.&lt;ref name=Anwary&gt;Anwar, Afroza, 'Acid Violence and Medical Care in Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework' in Mary K.

The organisation was founded in 2002 and now works with a network of six Acid Survivors Foundations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda that it has helped to form. Acid Survivors Trust International has helped to provide medical expertise and training to partners, raised valuable funds to support survivors of acid attacks and helped change laws. A key role for ASTI is to raise awareness of acid violence to an international audience so that increased pressure can be applied to governments to introduce stricter controls on the sale and purchase of acid.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acidviolence.org/index.php/acid-violence/|title=Acid Violence|author=Whitespace Design|website=Acidviolence.org|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of acid sales===
A positive correlation has been observed between acid attacks and ease of acid purchase.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; [[sulfuric acid|Sulfuric]], [[nitric acid|nitric]], and [[hydrochloric acid]] are most commonly used and are all cheap and readily available in many instances. For example, often acid throwers can purchase a liter of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] at motorbike mechanic shops for about 40 U.S. cents. [[Nitric acid]] costs around $1.50 per liter and is available for purchase at gold or jewelry shops, as polishers generally use it to purify gold and metals. [[Hydrochloric acid]] is also used for polishing jewelry, as well as for making [[soy sauce]], [[cosmetics]], and traditional medicine/[[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] drugs.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt;

Due to such ease of access, many organizations call for a stricter regulation on the acid economy. Specific actions include required [[license]]s for all acid traders, a ban on concentrated acid in certain areas, and an enhanced system of monitoring for acid sales, such as the need to document all transactions involving acid.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; However, some scholars have warned that such stringent regulation may result in [[black market]] trading of acid, which law enforcements must keep in mind.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;


==History==
Acid has been used in [[metallurgy]] and for etching since ancient times. The rhetorical and theatrical term "La Vitrioleuse" was coined in France after a "wave of vitriolage" occurred according to the popular press where, in 1879, 16 cases of vitriol attacks were widely reported as [[Crime of passion|crimes of passion]] perpetrated predominantly by women against other women.&lt;ref name=13a/&gt; Much was made of the idea that women, no matter how few, had employed such violent means to an end. On October 17, 1915, acid was fatally thrown on [[Prince Leopold Clement of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], heir to the [[House of Koháry]], by his distraught mistress, [[Camilla Rybicka]], who then [[Murder–suicide|killed herself]]. Sensationalizing such incidents made for lucrative newspaper sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TC19160107.2.10|title=Royal Love Tragedy|work=[[The Colonist]]|publisher=Papers Past, [[National Library of New Zealand]]|date=1916-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of acid as a weapon began to rise in many [[developing country|developing nations]], specifically those in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=7a /&gt; The first recorded acid attacks in South Asia occurred in Bangladesh in 1967,&lt;ref name=12a&gt;{{cite web |title=Combating Acid Violence In Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/AvonGlobalCenterforWomenandJustice.pdf|publisher=Avon Foundation for Women|accessdate=6 March 2013|authors=Avon Global Center for Women and Justice at Cornell Law School, Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City bar Association, Cornell Law School international Human Rights Clinic, and the Virtue Foundation|pages=1–64|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; India in 1982, and Cambodia in 1993.&lt;ref name=13a/&gt; Since then, research has witnessed an increase in the quantity and severity of acid attacks in the region. However, this can be traced to significant underreporting in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a general lack of research on this phenomenon during that period.&lt;ref name=2a&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh |url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |publisher=International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific |accessdate=6 March 2013 |author=Naripokkho |author2=Bangladesh Mahila Parishad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922173913/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows acid attacks increasing in many [[developing country|developing nations]], with the exception of Bangladesh which has observed a decrease in incidence in the past few years.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

==Legislations==
Many countries have begun pushing for [[legislation]] addressing acid attacks, and a few have recently employed new [[law]]s against this crime.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; Under the [[Qisas]] law of Pakistan, the perpetrator may suffer the same fate as the victim, and may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.&lt;ref name="quisas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|title=Pakistan's Acid-Attack Victims Press for Justice|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=Women's eNews|date=July 13, 2004|author=Juliette Terzieff|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612174357/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|archivedate=2008-06-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is not binding and is rarely enforced according to a ''New York Times'' report.&lt;ref name="video.nytimes.com"/&gt; In Pakistan, the Lower House of [[parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] unanimously passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill on May 10, 2011. As punishment, according to the bill individuals held responsible for acid attacks face harsh fines and [[life in prison]]. However, the country with the most specific, effective legislation against acid attacks is Bangladesh, and such legal action has resulted in a steady 20–30% decrease in acid violence for the past few years.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; In 2013, India introduced an amendment to the [[Indian Penal Code]] through the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]], making acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which can extend to life imprisonment and with fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 |url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417194151/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India's top court ruled that authorities must regulate the sale of acid. The Supreme Court's ruling on July 16, 2013, came after an incident in which four sisters suffered severe burns after being attacked with acid by two men on a motorbike. Acid which is designed to clean rusted tools is often used in the attacks can be bought across the counter. But the judges said the buyer of such acids should in future have to provide a photo identity card to any retailer when they make a purchase. The retailers must register the name and address of the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's top court moves to curb acid attacks|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/2013718134222947132.html|work=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=2013-07-18|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Section 326 A of the Indian Penal Code|section 326 A]] of [[Indian Penal Code]] was enacted by the Indian Parliament to ensure enhanced punishment for acid throwing.

===Bangladesh===
In 2002, Bangladesh introduced the [[death penalty]] for acid attacks and laws strictly controlling the sale, use, storage, and [[international trade]] of acids. The acids are used in traditional trades carving marble nameplates, [[conch]] bangles, goldsmiths, tanneries, and other industries, which have largely failed to comply with the legislation. Salma Ali of the [[Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association]] derided these laws as ineffective.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh laws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/south_asia/5133410.stm|title=Bangladesh's acid attack problem|accessdate=2008-06-14|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2006|author=Roland Buerk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of these laws are the Acid Crime Control Act (ACCA) and the Acid Control Act (ACA), respectively.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

The ACCA directly impacts the [[criminal law|criminal]] aspect of acid attacks, and allows for the death penalty or a level of punishment corresponding to the area of the body affected. If the attack results in a [[Deafness|loss of hearing]] or [[Loss of sight|sight]] or damages the victim's [[face]], [[breast]]s, or [[sex organ]]s then the perpetrator faces either the death penalty or [[life imprisonment|life sentencing]]. If any other part of the body is maimed, then the criminal faces 7–14 years of [[imprisonment]] in addition to a fine of US$700. Additionally, throwing or attempting to throw acid without causing any physical or mental harm is punishable by this law and could result in a prison term of 3–7 years along with a US$700 fine. Furthermore, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]] that aid in such attacks assume the same [[legal liability|liability]] as those actually committing the crime.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

The ACA regulates the sale, usage, and storing of acid in Bangladesh through the creation of the National Acid Control Council (NACC). The law requires that the NACC implement policies regarding the trade, misuse, and disposal of acid, while also undertaking initiatives that raise awareness about the dangers of acid and improve victim treatment and rehabilitation. The ACA calls for district-level committees responsible for enacting local measures that enforce and further regulate acid use in towns and cities.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

===Pakistan===
Under the [[Qisas]] law of Pakistan, the perpetrator could suffer the same fate as the victim, if the victim or the victim's guardian chooses. It may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.&lt;ref name="womensenews.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html|title=Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860)|website=www.pakistani.org|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 336B of Pakistan Penal Code states: "Whoever causes hurt by corrosive substance shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than fourteen years and a minimum fine of one million rupees."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, section 299 defines ''Qisas'' and states: "''Qisas'' means punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as he has caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed qatl-iamd (intentional manslaughter) in exercise of the right of the victim or a Wali (the guardian of the victim)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
After a spate of attacks in London in 2017, the [[Home Office]] said it would consider changes in laws and measures regarding sales of acid, as well as changes in prosecution and sentencing guidelines. As of 2017, it is unlawful to carry acid with the intent to cause harm. Attacks are prosecuted as acts of [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40621303|work=BBC News|title=Acid attack punishments assessed in government review|date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/acid-attacks-uk-london-sale-law-change-theresa-may-latest-news-abh-gbh-a7840776.html|title=Theresa May hints at changing law after 'horrific' acid attacks in London|date=14 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three quarters of police investigations do not end in prosecution, either because the attacker could not be found, or because the victim is unwilling to press charges.&lt;ref name=telegraph_policestats /&gt; According to ASTI, of the 2,078 acid attack crimes recorded for the years 2011-2016 in UK, only 414 of those crimes resulted in charges being brought. Most acid attack crimes happened in London, where over 1,200 cases were recorded over the past five years. From 2011–2016 there were 1,464 crimes involving acid or corrosive substance. Northumbria recorded the second highest with 109 recorded attacks, Cambridgeshire had 69 attacks, Hertfordshire 67, Greater Manchester 57 and Humberside 52.

'''Vitriolage''' is the deliberate splashing of a person or object with acid, also known as [[vitriol]], in order to deface or kill. A female who engages in such an act is known as a '''vitrioleuse'''. There are instances of this act throughout history and in modern times, often in places where [[honor killings]] are also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vday.org/contents/violence/glossary/acidattacks |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072005/http://www.vday.org/contents/violence/glossary/acidattacks |archive-date=2008-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Affection,''' '''attraction''', '''infatuation''', or '''fondness''' is a "[[disposition]] or state of mind or body"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/affection|title=Affection - Define Affection at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is often associated with a [[feeling]] or type of [[love]]. It has given rise to a number of branches of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD7Hutcheson.html|title=17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions &gt; Francis Hutcheson on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|website=Plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[love]], amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. Writers on [[ethics]] generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Affection|volume=1|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a very simple demonstration of affection can have a broad variety of emotional reactions, from embarrassment to disgust to pleasure and annoyance. It also has a different physical effect on the giver and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Effects of Affection {{!}} Research Matters|url = https://researchmatters.asu.edu/stories/effects-affection-960|website = researchmatters.asu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restricted definition==
[[File:Smooches (baby and child kiss).jpg|thumb|right|A young girl kisses a baby on the cheek.]]
More specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  Affection is compared with passion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94G2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=affection+vs+passion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o_XQqMrXAhWFXRoKHRb6CnwQuwUIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cuba and the Politics of Passion|first=Damián J.|last=Fernández|date=1 January 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from the Greek "[[pathos]]". As such it appears in the writings of [[France|French]] philosopher [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/descartes1649part2.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Passions of the Soul|author=René Descartes|website=Earlymoderntexts.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/spinoza-psychological/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=LeBuffe|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=19 November 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and most of the writings of early British ethicists. However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.{{clarification|date=November 2017}} In this narrower sense, the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligations.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/sidgwick1874book4.pdf|p=345–349|title=Methods of Ethics|website=Earlymoderntexts.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
{{Further information|Public display of affection}}
Affection can be communicated by looks, words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Communication]] professor Kory Floyd of the [[University of Arizona]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants.&lt;ref&gt;Infant Observation: International Journal of Infant Observation and Its Applications&lt;/ref&gt; 
Expressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior  may be associated with  various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiments increase the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiments among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316162825/http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of affection===
Affection exchange is seen as an adaptive human behavior that contributes to greater physical and mental well-being. The expression of affection mediates emotional, physical, and relational benefits for the individual and significant counterparts. The communication of positive feelings towards others has shown health benefits that include; lower stress hormones, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and stronger immune system. [https://asunow.asu.edu/content/study-expressing-love-can-improve-your-health Affection Expression ] Benefits are internally noticed when the emotion is expressed and not merely felt, if affection is not reciprocated through the receiver, effects of the affection are still felt through the giver. 

===Parental relationships===
Affectionate behavior is often regarded as the result of parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards. Positive and negative parental behaviors can be linked to later life health problems. Abuse is a common attribute to poor health in later life, as the lack of affection leads to naturally poorer well-being and mental health. A 2013 study, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/lack-of-parental-warmth-abuse-248580 UCLA affection ] showed the effects of early child abuse and the outcome between lack of affection and the strong biological link for how these negative early-life experiences affect physical health.

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Chinese ancestor worship''', or '''Chinese ancestor veneration''', also called the '''Chinese patriarchal religion''',{{sfnb|Zhou|2003|p=42}} is an aspect of the [[Chinese traditional religion]] which revolves around the ritual celebration of the [[deification|deified]] ancestors and [[tutelary deities]] of [[Chinese kin|people with the same surname]] organised into [[Chinese lineage associations|lineage societies]] in [[ancestral shrines]]. Ancestors, their ghosts, or spirits, and gods are considered part of "this world", that is, they are neither supernatural (in the sense of being outside nature) nor transcendent in the sense of being beyond nature. The ancestors are humans who have become godly beings, beings who keep their individual identities. For this reason, Chinese religion is founded on veneration of ancestors.{{sfnb|Nadeau|2010|p=369}} Ancestors are believed to be a means of connection to the supreme power of [[Tian]]  as they are considered embodiments or reproducers of the creative order of Heaven.{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|pp=113-116}}

[[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors, an aspect of [[filial piety]]; Zhuo Xinping (2011) views traditional patriarchal religion as the religious organisation complementing the ideology of Confucianism.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=281}} As the "bedrock faith of the Chinese", traditional patriarchal religion influences the religious psychology of all Chinese and has influenced the other religions of China,{{sfnb|He|2012}} as it is evident in the worship of founders of temples and schools of thought in [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]].

Ancestor veneration practices prevail in south China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon [[agnatic seniority|seniority]], and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent;{{sfnb|Wu|2014|p=20|ps=. Quote: «[...] southern China refers to Fujian and Guangdong province and in some cases is expanded to include Guangxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period. These areas not only were the first to revive lineage and the territorial cult in the reform era, but also have the intensity and scale of revivals that cannot be matched by the other part of China. This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.» Note 16: The south-vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen’s article on “Lineage organization in North China (1990)” offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model “the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.” By which, he means “patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.” (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called “the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.” In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. “Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.” However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China. The set of characteristics of the north model (a distinctive arrangement of cemeteries, graves, ancestral scrolls, ancestral tablets, and corporate groups linked to a characteristic annual ritual cycle) is not a system. In reality, lineage organizations display a mixture between the south and the north model.»}} whereas in north China [[Chinese communal deity religion|worship of communal deities]] is prevalent.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|pp. 12-13Overmyer, 2009. pp=12-13|ps=. "As for the physical and social structure of villages on this vast flat expanse; they consist of close groups of houses built on a raised area, surrounded by their fields, with a multi-surnamed population of families who own and cultivate their own land, though usually not much more than twenty ''mou'' or about three acres. [...] Families of different surnames living in one small community meant that lineages were not strong enough to maintain lineage shrines and cross-village organizations, so, at best, they owned small burial plots and took part only in intra-village activities. The old imperial government encouraged villages to manage themselves and collect and hand over their own taxes. [...] leaders were responsible for settling disputes, dealing with local government, organizing crop protection and planning for collective ceremonies. All these factors tended to strengthen the local protective deities and their temples as focal points of village identity and activity. This social context defines North China local religion, and keeps us from wandering off into vague discussions of ‘popular’ and ‘elite’ and relationships with Daoism and Buddhism."}}

Some contemporary scholars in China have adopted the names "Chinese traditional patriarchal religion" (中國傳統宗法性宗教 ''Zhōngguó chuántǒng zōngfǎ xìng zōngjiào'') or "Chinese traditional primordial religion" (中國傳統原生性宗教 ''Zhōngguó chuántǒng yuánshēng xìng zōngjiào'') to define the traditional religious system organised around the worship of ancestor-gods.&lt;ref name="Zhang-Yang"&gt;Zhang Jin, Yang Chunpeng.

Zhang Jin and Yang Chunpeng, based at the Folk Religion Institute and Party School Theory Research Section of Xuanen County, in an article on the China Ethnic and Religious Network define Chinese traditional primordial religion as faith in [[God]] ([[Shangdi]])'s original form.&lt;ref name="Zhang-Yang"/&gt;

Mou Zhongjian defines "clan-based traditional patriarchal religion" as "an orthodox religion that was widely accepted by all classes, and had been practiced for thousands of years in ancient China".{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}} Mou also says that this religion was subordinate to the state, it was "diverse and inclusive" and had "a humanistic spirit that emphasises the social, moral function of religion", and is closely related to politics.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}} It refers to:{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|pp=280-281}}
:«[...] The traditional religion that had been in place since the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. It evolved from the worship of Heaven and ancestors. It had the basic components of a religion, including religious concepts, emotions, and rituals. It had no independent organisation. Instead, it was the kinship structure that fulfilled the functions of religious organisation. The emperor, who was the son of God, was the representative of the people who worshiped Heaven. Elders of the clans and parents represented the family in the worship of ancestors. Respecting Heaven and honoring ancestors (''jingtian fazu''), taking good care in seeing off the deceased, and maintaining sacrifices to distant ancestors (''shenzhong zhuiyuan'') were the basic religious concepts and emotional expressions in this religion. [...]»

According to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal religion and Confucianism complemented each other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}}

In [[Chinese folk religion]], a person is thought to have multiple souls, categorized as [[Hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']], commonly associated with [[yin and yang|yang and yin]], respectively. Upon death, ''hun'' and ''po'' separate. Generally, the former ascends into heaven and latter descends into the earth and/or resides within a [[spirit tablet]]; however, beliefs concerning the number and nature of souls vary.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Richard J. Smith (2007). ''Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/prb/journey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with these traditional beliefs, various practices have arisen to address the perceived needs of the deceased.

===Mourning===
The mourning of a loved one usually involves elaborate rituals, which vary according to region and sect. The intensity of the mourning is thought to reflect the quality of relationship one had with the deceased. From the time of Confucius until the 20th century, a three-year mourning period was often prescribed, mirroring the first three years in a child's life when they are utterly dependent upon and loved unconditionally by their parents. These mourning practices would often include wearing sackcloth or simple garb, leaving hair unkempt, eating a restricted diet of [[congee]] two times a day, living in a mourning shack placed beside the house, and moaning in pain at certain intervals of the day. It is said{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} that after the death of Confucius his followers engaged in this three-year mourning period to symbolize their commitment to his teachings.

===Funeral rites===
[[File:Cangnan - Longgang - P1210226 - funeral procession.JPG|thumb|A funeral procession in Zhejiang province]]
Funerals are considered to be a part of the normal process of family life, serving as a cornerstone in inter-generational traditions. The primary goals, regardless of religious beliefs, are to demonstrate obeisance and provide comfort for the deceased. Other goals include: to protect the descents of the deceased from malevolent spirits and to ensure the proper separation and direction of the deceased's soul into the afterlife.

Some common elements of Chinese funerals include the expression of grief through prolonged, often exaggerated wailing; the wearing of white mortuary clothes by the family of the deceased; a ritual washing of the corpse, followed by its attiring in grave clothes; the transfer of symbolic goods such as money and food from the living to the dead; the preparation and installation of a [[spirit tablet]] or the use of a [[Shi (personator)|personator]], often symbolic. Sometimes, ritual specialists such as Taoist priests or Buddhist monks would be hired to perform specific rites, often accompanied by the playing of music or chanting of scripture to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson, L. G. (1979). ''Chinese Religion: An Introduction Third Edition''. Belmont, California: Wadsworth, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

===Burial===
[[File:Cangnan - Jinxiang - Qiantoulian - P1210370.JPG|thumb|A typical traditional hill slope cemetery of China's southeastern coast]]
Burial is often delayed according to wealth; the coffin would remain in the main room of the family home until it has been properly prepared for burial. More traditionally, this delay is pre-determined according to social status: the corpse of a king or [[Emperor of China|emperor]] would be held in abeyance for seven months; magnates, five; other officers, three; commoners, one.

In some instances, a "lucky burial" can take place several years after the burial. The bones are dug up, washed, dried, and stored in an earthenware jar. After a period of storage, the contents are then interred in their final resting place in a location selected by an [[Feng Shui|augur]] to optimize the flow of ''[[qi]]''. A bad ''qi'' flow could result in a disgruntled spirit who could possibly haunt their descendants.&lt;ref name="religionfacts"&gt;ReligionFacts. (2005, June 2). ''Ancestor Veneration''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from www.religionfacts.com: http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/practices/ancestor_worship.htm &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;

The deceased would often be buried with sacrifices, typically things one was thought to be in need of in the afterlife. This was done as a symbolic demonstration of filial piety or grandeur. For the wealthy and powerful, bronze vessels, oracle bones, and human or animal sacrifices often accompanied the deceased into the grave. More common sacrifices included candles and incense, as well as offerings of wine and food.

===Continued obeisance===
After the funeral, families often install an ancestral tablet at a household altar alongside other deceased ancestors. This act symbolically unifies the ancestors and honors the family lineage. Incense is lit before the altar daily, significant announcements are made before them, and offerings such as favorite foods, beverages, and [[joss paper|spirit money]] are given bi-monthly and on special occasions, such as [[Qingming Festival]] and [[Ghost Festival]].&lt;ref name="religionfacts"/&gt;

[[Prayer]] was usually performed at the household altar in a separate room containing the ''po'' of their ancestors. The eldest male would speak to the altar on a regular basis. In some belief systems where special powers are ascribed to the deceased, he may supplicate the spirit to bless the family.

'''Apramada''' (Sanskrit, also ''apramāda''; Pali: ''appamada''; Tibetan Wylie: ''bag yod pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "conscientious"  or "concern". It is defined as taking great care concerning what should be adopted and what should be avoided.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 634-635.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is identified as one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Eleven virtuous mental factors|eleven virtuous mental factors]] within the Mahayana [[Abhidharma]] teachings.

}}
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states:&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

:What is concern? From taking its stand on non-attachment ([[alobha]]), non-hatred ([[adveṣa]]), and non-deludedness ([[amoha]]) coupled with diligence ([[vīrya]]), it considers whatever is positive and protects the mind against things which cannot satisfy. Its function is to make complete and to realize all worldly and transworldly excellences.

Alexander Berzin states:&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Berzin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
: A caring attitude (bag-yod, carefulness) is a subsidiary awareness that, while remaining in a state of detachment, imperturbability, lack of naivety, and joyful perseverance, causes us to meditate on constructive things and safeguards against leaning toward tainted (negative) things. In other words, being disgusted with and not longing for compulsive existence, not wanting to cause harm in response to its suffering, not being naive about the effects of our behavior, and taking joy in acting constructively, a caring attitude brings us to act constructively and to refrain from destructive behavior. This is because we care about the situations of others and ourselves and about the effects of our actions on both; we take them seriously.

Robert Thurman emphasizes the high degree of apramada of someone who has realized [[sunyata|emptiness]] (a.k.a. "voidness"):&lt;ref&gt;Thurman (2008), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
: This denotes a type of awareness of the most seemingly insignificant aspects of daily life, an awareness derived as a consequence of the highest realization of the ultimate nature of reality. As it is stated in the ''Anavataptaparipṛcchasutra'': "He who realizes voidness, that person is consciously aware." "Ultimate realization," far from obliterating the relative world, brings it into highly specific, albeit dreamlike, focus.

This term is described at length in chapter four of the [[Bodhicharyavatara]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6848">'''Argument from analogy''' is a special type of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive argument]], whereby perceived similarities are used as a basis to infer some further similarity that has yet to be observed.  Analogical reasoning is one of the most common methods by which human beings attempt to understand the world and make decisions.&lt;ref name="Baronett"&gt;{{Cite book

| pages = 321–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a person has a bad experience with a product and decides not to buy anything further from the producer, this is often a case of analogical reasoning.  It is also implicit in much of science; for instance, experiments on laboratory rats typically proceed on the basis that some physiological similarities between rats and humans entails some further similarity (e.g. possible reactions to a drug).&lt;ref name="salmon"&gt;{{citation|last=Salmon|first=Merrilee|title=Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vd8JAAAAQBAJ|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-71164-2|pages=132–142|chapter=Arguments from analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Gensler
| first = Harry J.
| title = Introduction to Logic
| publisher = [[Routledge]]
| location = New York, NY
| year = 2003
| pages = 333–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure or form may be generalized like so:&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;

: P and Q are similar in respect to properties a, b, and c.
: P has been observed to have further property x.
: Therefore, Q probably has property x also.

The argument does not assert that the two things are ''large and very big'', only that they are ''similar''.  The argument may provide us with ''good evidence'' for the conclusion, but the conclusion does not follow as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]].&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;  Determining the strength of the argument requires that we take into consideration more than just the ''form'': the ''content'' must also come under scrutiny.

== Analyzing arguments from analogy ==

===Strength of an analogy===

Several {{vanchor|factors}} affect the strength of the argument from analogy:
* The '''{{vanchor|relevance}}''' (positive or negative) of the ''known'' similarities to the similarity ''inferred in the conclusion''.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;
* The '''{{vanchor|degree}}''' of relevant similarity (or dissimilarity) between the two objects.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;
* The '''{{vanchor|amount}}''' and '''{{vanchor|variety|diversity}}''' of instances that form the basis of the analogy.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;

===Counterarguments===

Arguments from analogy may be attacked by use of '''disanalogy''', '''counteranalogy''', and by pointing out '''unintended consequences''' of an analogy.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  In order to understand how one might go about analyzing an argument from analogy, consider the [[Watchmaker analogy|teleological argument]] and the criticisms of this argument put forward by the philosopher [[David Hume]].

According to the analogical reasoning in the teleological argument, it would be ridiculous to assume that a complex object such as a watch came about through some random process. Since we have no problem at all inferring that such objects must have had an intelligent designer who created it for some purpose, we ought to draw the same conclusion for another complex and apparently designed object: the universe.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;

Hume argued that the universe and a watch have many relevant dissimilarities; for instance, the universe is often very disorderly and random. This is the strategy of "disanalogy": just as the amount and variety of relevant similarities between two objects strengthens an analogical conclusion, so do the amount and variety of relevant dissimilarities weaken it.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  Creating a "counteranalogy," Hume argued that some natural objects seem to have order and complexity — snowflakes for example — but are not the result of intelligent direction.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  But then just as the snowflake's order and complexity itself might not have direction, the causes of the order and complexity might.  So this would be an example of disproof by begging the question.  Finally, Hume provides many possible "unintended consequences" of the argument; for instance, given that objects such as watches are often the result of the labor of groups of individuals, the reasoning employed by the teleological argument would seem to lend support to polytheism.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;

==False analogy==
A '''false analogy''' is a faulty instance of the argument from analogy.

An argument from analogy is weakened if it is inadequate in any of the [[#factors|above respects]]. The term "false analogy" comes from the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], who was one of the first individuals to engage in a detailed examination of analogical reasoning.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt; One of Mill's examples involved an inference that some person is lazy from the observation that his or her sibling is lazy. According to Mill, sharing parents is not all that relevant to the property of laziness.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;

===Examples===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
A basic example:
"The model of the solar system is similar to that of an atom, with planets orbiting the sun like electrons orbiting the nucleus. Electrons can jump from orbit to orbit; so we should study ancient records for sightings of planets jumping from orbit to orbit."

Another example is:

Person A: ''"I think that people can have some affection for their cultural heritage."''

Person B: ''"You're just like [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]!"''

In the above example, Person B has evaded a reasoned discussion by tarring Person A with an irrelevant association to an idea that Hitler used.
No one person is identical to another to the extent that their proposals can be disparaged by a mere reference to that other person. It is a form of [[ad hominem]]: Attacking the messenger, rather than the message. The above example is also an example of [[Reductio ad Hitlerum]] and, in an online context, invokes [[Godwin's law]].

The '''CATH Protein Structure Classification database''' is a free, publicly available online resource that provides information on the evolutionary relationships of [[protein domain]]s. It was created in the mid-1990s by Professor [[Christine Orengo]] and colleagues including [[Janet Thornton]] and [[David Tudor Jones|David Jones]],&lt;ref name=Orengo1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orengo|first1=CA|last2=Michie|first2=AD|last3=Jones|first3=S|last4=Jones|first4=DT|authorlink4=David Tudor Jones|last5=Swindells|first5=MB|last6=Thornton|first6=JM|authorlink6=Janet Thornton|title=CATH – a hierarchic classification of protein domain structures|journal=Structure|volume=5|issue=8|year=1997|pages=1093–1109|issn=0969-2126|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(97)00260-8|pmid=9309224}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be developed by the Orengo group at [[University College London]]. CATH shares many broad features with the [[Structural Classification of Proteins|SCOP]] resource, however there are also many areas in which the detailed classification differs greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info |title=CATH: Protein Structure Classification Database at UCL |website=Cathdb.info |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/wiki/doku/?id=tutorials:index |title=CATH |website=Cathdb.info |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CATHDatabase |title=CATH Database (@CATHDatabase) |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Pearl2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearl|first1=F.

==Hierarchical organization==
Experimentally-determined protein three-dimensional structures are obtained from the Protein Data Bank and split into their consecutive polypeptide chains, where applicable. Protein domains are identified within these chains using a mixture of automatic methods and manual curation.

The domains are then classified within the CATH structural hierarchy: at the Class (C) level, domains are assigned according to their secondary structure content, i.e. all alpha, all beta, a mixture of alpha and beta, or little secondary structure; at the Architecture (A) level, information on the secondary structure arrangement in three-dimensional space is used for assignment; at the Topology/fold (T) level, information on how the secondary structure elements are connected and arranged is used; assignments are made to the Homologous superfamily (H) level if there is good evidence that the domains are related by evolution &lt;ref name=Orengo1997/&gt; i.e. they are homologous.

{| class="wikitable"
|+The four main levels of the CATH hierarchy:
!#
!Level
!Description
|-
|1 || '''C'''lass || the overall secondary-structure content of the domain. (Equivalent to the [[Structural Classification of Proteins database|SCOP]] [[Protein fold class|Class]])
|-
|2 || '''A'''rchitecture || high structural similarity but no evidence of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. (Equivalent to the 'fold' level in SCOP)
|-
|3 || '''T'''opology/fold || a large-scale grouping of topologies which share particular structural features
|-
|4 || '''H'''omologous superfamily || indicative of a demonstrable evolutionary relationship. (Equivalent to SCOP [[protein superfamily|superfamily]]) 
|}

Additional sequence data for domains with no experimentally determined structures are provided by CATH's sister resource, Gene3D, which are used to populate the homologous superfamilies. Protein sequences from UniProtKB and Ensembl are scanned against CATH HMMs to predict domain sequence boundaries and make homologous superfamily assignments.

==Releases==
The CATH team aim to provide official releases of the CATH classification every 12 months. This release process is important because is allows for the provision of internal validation, extra annotations and analysis. However, it can mean that there is a time delay between new structures appearing in the PDB and the latest official CATH release,

In order to address this issue: CATH-B provides a limited amount of information to the very latest domain annotations (e.g. domain boundaries and superfamily classifications).

The latest release of CATH-Gene3D (v4.1) was released in July 2016 and consists of:

* 308,999 structural protein domain entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;
* 53,479,436 non-structural protein domain entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;
* 2,737 homologous superfamily entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;
* 92,882 functional family entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;

==Open source software==
CATH is an [[open source software]] project, with developers developing and maintaining a number of open source tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/wiki/doku/?id=cath_tools|title=Tools|last=|first=|date=|website=cathdb.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; CATH maintains a todo list on [[GitHub]] to allow external users to create and keep track of issues relating to the CATH protein structure classification.

Richards is Professor of Media Arts at the [[University of Ottawa]].&lt;ref name="University of Ottawa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty of Arts /Catherine Richards|url=http://arts.uottawa.ca/visualarts/people/richards-catherine|website=arts.uottawa.ca|publisher=University of Ottawa|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Catherine Richards' work explores the spectator and information technology relationship as the "jam in the electro-magnetic sandwich."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catherinerichards.ca/biography.html|title=Catherine Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; She deals with both old and new types of technology, exploreing the volatile sense of ourselves as we are shifting our boundaries - a process in which new technologies play a starring role.

Richards has exhibited within and without North America at major venues including the 2004 [[Sydney Biennale]]. Her work has been discussed in publications by major theorists in the field including [[Katherine Hayles]] and [[Frances Dyson]], and has been included in key surveys such as [https://books.google.ca/books/about/Art_+_Science_Now.html?id=zKBGAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Art &amp; Science Now], edited by Stephen Wilson. Richards is well known for collaborating with scientists and won the Artist in Residence for Research Fellowship (AIRes) at the [[National Research Council of Canada]], 2002-2005, and is the recipient of the highest media prize in Canada from [[Canada Council for the Arts]], Media Arts.  Her work on virtuality and new media is considered groundbreaking in setting the aesthetic terrain, realm of artistic intervention and substantive issues.

Richards was the first and sole artist to be awarded University Research Chair at the University of Ottawa. As a model for other universities, it is part of an on-going movement across North America to accept art as research within universities, a goal in which Richards has played a significant pioneering role.

In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], the '''continuum''' means the [[real numbers]], or the corresponding (infinite) [[cardinal number]], &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Georg Cantor]] proved that the cardinality &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; is larger than the smallest infinity, namely, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. He also proved that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt; 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the [[natural numbers]].

The ''[[cardinality of the continuum]]'' is the [[cardinality|size]] of the set of real numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] is sometimes stated by saying that no [[cardinality]] lies between that of the continuum and that of the [[natural numbers]], &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Linear continuum == 
{{Main|Linear continuum}}
According to [[Raymond Wilder]] (1965) there are four axioms that make a set ''C'' and the relation &lt; into a '''linear continuum''':
* ''C'' is [[simply ordered set|simply ordered]] with respect to &lt;.
* If [''A,B''] is a cut of ''C'', then either ''A'' has a last element or ''B'' has a first element. (compare [[Dedekind cut]])
* There exists a non-empty, [[countable]] subset ''S'' of ''C'' such that, if ''x,y'' &amp;isin; ''C'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then there exists ''z'' &amp;isin; ''S'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. ([[separable space|separability axiom]])
* ''C'' has no first element and no last element. ([[Bounded set|Unboundedness axiom]])
These axioms characterize the [[order type]] of the [[real number line]].

In [[differential geometry]], the '''Cotton tensor''' on a (pseudo)-[[Riemannian manifold]] of dimension ''n'' is a third-order [[tensor field|tensor]] concomitant of the [[metric tensor|metric]], like the [[Weyl curvature|Weyl tensor]]. The vanishing of the Cotton tensor for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} is [[necessary condition|necessary]] and [[sufficient condition]] for the manifold to be [[conformally flat]], as with the Weyl tensor for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 4}}. For {{nowrap|''n'' &lt; 3}} the Cotton tensor is identically zero. The concept is named after [[Émile Cotton]].

The proof of the classical result that for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} the vanishing of the Cotton tensor is equivalent to the metric being conformally flat is given by [[Luther P. Eisenhart|Eisenhart]] using a standard [[integrability condition|integrability]] argument. This tensor density is  uniquely characterized by its conformal properties coupled with the demand that it be differentiable for arbitrary metrics, as shown by {{Harv|Aldersley|1979}}.

Recently, the study of three-dimensional spaces is becoming of great interest, because the Cotton tensor restricts the relation between the Ricci tensor and the [[energy–momentum tensor]] of matter in the [[Einstein equation]]s and plays an important role in the [[Hamiltonian formalism]] of [[general relativity]].

== Definition ==

In coordinates, and denoting the [[Ricci tensor]] by ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and the scalar curvature by ''R'', the components of the Cotton tensor are

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ijk} = \nabla_{k} R_{ij} - \nabla_{j} R_{ik} + \frac{1}{2(n-1)}\left( \nabla_{j}Rg_{ik} -  \nabla_{k}Rg_{ij}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Cotton tensor can be regarded as a vector valued [[Differential form|2-form]], and for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 one can use the [[Hodge star operator]] to convert this into a second order trace free tensor density

:&lt;math&gt;C_i^j = \nabla_{k} \left( R_{li} - \frac{1}{4} Rg_{li}\right)\epsilon^{klj},&lt;/math&gt;

sometimes called the ''Cotton–[[James W. York|York]] tensor''.

==Properties==

===Conformal rescaling===
Under conformal rescaling of the metric &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g} = e^{2\omega} g&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. We see that the [[Christoffel symbol]]s transform as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\Gamma}^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}=\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}+S^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the tensor

:&lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} = \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} \partial_{\beta} \omega + \delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} \partial_{\gamma} \omega - g_{\beta\gamma} \partial^{\alpha} \omega&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Riemann curvature tensor]] transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;{\widetilde{R}^{\lambda}}{}_{\mu\alpha\beta}={R^{\lambda}}_{\mu\alpha\beta}+\nabla_{\alpha}S^{\lambda}_{\beta\mu}-\nabla_{\beta}S^{\lambda}_{\alpha\mu}+S^{\lambda}_{\alpha\rho}S^{\rho}_{\beta\mu}-S^{\lambda}_{\beta\rho}S^{\rho}_{\alpha\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

In &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifolds, we obtain the [[Ricci tensor]] by contracting the transformed Riemann tensor to see it transform as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{\beta\mu}=R_{\beta\mu}-g_{\beta\mu}\nabla^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha}\omega-(n-2)\nabla_{\mu}\partial_{\beta}\omega+(n-2)(\partial_{\mu}\omega\partial_{\beta}\omega-g_{\beta\mu}\partial^{\lambda}\omega\partial_{\lambda}\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly the [[Ricci scalar]] transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}=e^{-2\omega}R-2e^{-2\omega}(n-1)\nabla^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha}\omega-(n-2)(n-1)e^{-2\omega}\partial^{\lambda}\omega\partial_{\lambda}\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Combining all these facts together permits us to conclude the Cotton-York tensor transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{C}_{\alpha\beta\gamma}=C_{\alpha\beta\gamma}+(n-2)\partial_{\lambda}\omega {W_{\beta\gamma\alpha}}^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

or using coordinate independent language as

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{C} = C \; + \; \operatorname{grad} \, \omega \; \lrcorner \; W,&lt;/math&gt;

where the gradient is plugged into the symmetric part of the [[Weyl tensor]]&amp;nbsp;''W''.

===Symmetries===
The Cotton tensor has the following symmetries:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ijk} = - C_{ikj} \, &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;C_{[ijk]} = 0. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In addition the Bianchi formula for the [[Weyl tensor]] can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = (3-n) C, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the positive divergence in the first component of ''W''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5130">The '''Declaration of Tokyo''' is a set of international guidelines for physicians concerning [[torture]] and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in relation to detention and imprisonment, which was adopted in October 1975 during the 29th General assembly of the [[World Medical Association]], and later editorially updated by the WMA in France, May 2005 and 2006. It declares torture to be "contrary to the laws of humanity",&lt;ref name="WMA DOT Policy Preamble"&gt;World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo.'' Preamble.&lt;/ref&gt;  and antithetical to the "higher purpose" of the [[physician]], which is to "alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human being."&lt;ref name="WMA DOT Policy Article 5"&gt;World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo.'' Section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy states that doctors should refuse to participate in, condone, or give permission for torture, degradation, or cruel treatment of prisoners or detainees. According to the policy, a prisoner who [[Hunger strike|refuses to eat]] should not be [[Force-feeding|fed artificially against his will]], provided that he or she is judged to be rational.

==Content==
===Preamble ===
It is the privilege of the physician to practise [[medicine]] in the service of humanity, to preserve and restore bodily and [[mental health]] without distinction as to persons, to comfort and to ease the suffering of his or her patients. The utmost respect for human life is to be maintained even under threat, and no use made of any medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.
For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a [[confession]], or for any other reason.

===Declaration===
#The physician shall not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading procedures, whatever the offense of which the victim of such procedures is suspected, accused or guilty, and whatever the victim's beliefs or motives, and in all situations, including armed conflict and civil strife.
#The physician shall not provide any premises, instruments, substances or knowledge to facilitate the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to diminish the ability of the victim to resist such treatment.
#When providing medical assistance to detainees or prisoners who are, or who could later be, under [[interrogation]], physicians should be particularly careful to ensure the confidentiality of all personal medical information. A breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]] shall in any case be reported by the physician to relevant authorities. The physician shall not use nor allow to be used, as far as he or she can, medical knowledge or skills, or health information specific to individuals, to facilitate or otherwise aid any interrogation, legal or illegal, of those individuals.
#The physician shall not be present during any procedure during which torture or any other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is used or threatened.
#A physician must have complete clinical independence in deciding upon the care of a person for whom he or she is medically responsible. The physician's fundamental role is to alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human beings, and no motive, whether personal, collective or political, shall prevail against this higher purpose.
#Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the physician as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment concerning the consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment, he or she shall not be fed artificially. The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a judgment should be confirmed by at least one other independent physician. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be explained by the physician to the prisoner.
#The World Medical Association will support, and should encourage the international community, the National Medical Associations and fellow physicians to support, the physician and his or her family in the face of threats or reprisals resulting from a refusal to condone the use of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Medical Association. Declaration of Tokyo (1975). Adopted by the World Medical Association, Tokyo, Japan. October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digeponics''' (pronounced die-jeh-ponics, as in digestion) is a method of [[agriculture]] which integrates the products of [[anaerobic digestion]], including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[digestate]], with greenhouse cultivation of vegetables.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoknes|first=K.|last2=Scholwin|first2=F.|last3=Krzesiński|first3=W.|last4=Wojciechowska|first4=E.|last5=Jasińska|first5=A.|date=2016-10-01|title=Efficiency of a novel "Food to waste to food" system including anaerobic digestion of food waste and cultivation of vegetables on digestate in a bubble-insulated greenhouse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X16303336|journal=Waste Management|volume=56|issue=Supplement C|pages=466–476|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2016.06.027|pmid=27425859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Digeponics was developed in Norway by the "Food to Waste to Food" (F2W2F) program, a part of the [[EU Eco-innovation Initiative]], in partnership with the waste management company Lindum AS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoknes |first1=Ketil |last2=Wojciechowska |first2=E. |last3=Jasińska |first3=A. |last4=Gulliksen |first4=A. |last5=Tesfamichael |first5=A. |title=Growing vegetables in the circular economy; cultivation of tomatoes on green waste compost and food waste digestate. |journal=Acta Hortic. |volume=1215 |pages=389-396 |doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.71 |url=https://doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.71 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eco-innovation/projects/en/projects/f2w2f|title=Food to Waste to Food - Eco-Innovation - European Commission|website=Eco-Innovation|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overall concept ==
The method involves the use of various products of anaerobic digestion in the cultivation of vegetables in a greenhouse environment.  The more widely used aspects include the use of biogas for electricity production, which is used for lighting and heating the greenhouse in the winter months, as well as the introduction of carbon dioxide into the greenhouse, which is a byproduct of biogas combustion, for increased plant growth.  The more novel aspect of this method is the use of a "mix of [[vermicompost]] and garden waste compost fertilized by (non-separated) [[digestate]] in a circulating system including earth worms in the substrate and aeration in a biofilter buffer tank." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Performance ==
Research conducted on digeponics found that this method, and others like it, could meet or exceed the production rates of mineral fertilizers.  For [[tomato]] production, digeponics yielded 5430&amp;nbsp;g, compared to 4920&amp;nbsp;g for mineral fertilizers.  For [[cucumber]] production, digeponics yielded 19560g, compared to 8502g for mineral fertilizers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to increased yields, this method can provide decreased energy costs and very low carbon emissions, by producing energy on site from renewable carbon neutral sources that are readily available to the farmer, and could even provide an additional source of income by charging tipping fees for organic waste collection and selling excess electricity or gas back into the grid.  Methane emissions were shown to be reduced by 98%, compared to landfilling of organic waste, and carbon emissions were reduced 95%, compared with conventional tomato greenhouse production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Domino 01.jpg|thumb|Domino effect events]]
[[Image:Domino effect.jpg|thumb|upright|(Top) Dominoes are standing. (Bottom) Dominoes are in motion.]]
A '''domino effect''' or '''[[chain reaction]]''' is the cumulative effect produced when one event sets off a chain of similar events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=domino effect|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/domino+effect|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is best known as a mechanical effect and is used as an analogy to a [[Domino show|falling row]] of [[dominoes]]. It typically refers to a linked sequence of events where the time between successive events is relatively small. It can be used literally (an observed series of actual collisions) or metaphorically (causal linkages within systems such as global finance or politics). The term ''domino effect'' is used both to imply that an event is inevitable or highly likely (as it has already started to happen), and conversely to imply that an event is impossible or highly unlikely (the one domino left standing).

The '''dream argument''' is the postulation that the act of dreaming provides preliminary evidence that the [[sense]]s we trust to distinguish [[reality]] from [[illusion]] should not be fully trusted, and therefore, any state that is dependent on our senses should at the very least be carefully examined and rigorously tested to determine whether it is in fact reality.

== Synopsis ==
{{Descartes}}
While one [[dream]]s, one does not normally [[lucid dreaming|realize]] one is dreaming. This has led [[philosophy|philosophers]] to wonder whether it is possible for one ever to be [[certainty|certain]], at any given point in time, that one is not in fact dreaming, or whether indeed it could be possible for one to remain in a perpetual dream state and never experience the reality of [[wakefulness]] at all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the [[Western philosophy|West]], this philosophical puzzle was referred to by [[Plato]] ([[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']] 158b-d) and [[Aristotle]] ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] 1011a6). Having received serious attention in [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', the dream [[Logical argument|argument]] has become one of the most prominent [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This type of argument is sometimes referred to as the "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly|Zhuangzi paradox]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman—how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.&lt;ref&gt;莊子, 齊物論, 12. ''Zhuàngzi'', "Discussion on making all things equal," 12. ''from'' Zhuàngzi, Burton Watson trans., ''Chuang Tzu'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996), 43. {{ISBN|978-0-231-10595-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1BvUUUVRLEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first philosophers to posit the dream argument formally was the [[Yogachara]] philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] (4th to 5th century C.E.) in his "[[Twenty verses on appearance only]]." 

The dream argument came to feature prominently in [[Mahayana]] and [[Tibetan Buddhist]] philosophy. Some [[reality in Buddhism|schools of thought ]] (''e.g.'', [[Dzogchen]]) consider ''perceived [[reality]]'' to be literally unreal. As [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream . . . ."&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only [[visual perception]]s, but also appearances perceived through all [[sense]]s, including [[hearing|sounds]], [[Odour|smell]]s, [[taste]]s, and [[touch|tactile sensations]], and [[mental operations|operations]] on perceived mental objects.

== Hutton's paradox ==

A paradox concerning dreams and the nature of reality was described by the British writer Eric Bond Hutton in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"Adversaria V," ''Write Justified'', Spring 1989. For Hutton's definitive statement on the subject see "Hutton's Paradox," ''Fortean Times'', April 2015, archived online [https://archive.org/stream/Fortean_Times_April_2015_UK#page/n71/mode/2up here].&lt;/ref&gt; As a child Hutton often had [[lucid dream|lucid dreams]], in which everything seemed as real as in waking life. This led him to wonder whether life itself was a dream, even whether he existed only in somebody else's dream. Sometimes he had [[pre-lucid dream|pre-lucid dreams]], in which more often than not he concluded he was awake. Such dreams disturbed him greatly, but one day he came up with a magic formula for use in them: "If I find myself asking 'Am I dreaming?' it proves I am, for the question would never occur to me in waking life." Yet, such is the nature of dreams, he could never recall it when he needed to. Many years later, when he wrote a piece about solipsism and his childhood interest in dreams, he was struck by a contradiction in his earlier reasoning. True, asking oneself "Am I dreaming?" ''in a dream'' would seem to prove one is. Yet that is precisely what he had often asked himself in waking life. Therein lay a paradox. What was he to conclude? That it does not prove one is dreaming? Or that life really is a dream?

== Simulated reality ==
{{See also|Simulated reality|Simulation hypothesis}}

Dreaming provides a springboard for those who question whether our own reality may be an illusion. The ability of the mind to be tricked into believing a mentally generated world is the "real world" means at least one variety of simulated reality is a common, even nightly event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bttg3B5CZOIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=dreaming+simulated+reality&amp;ots=iPQG-evOVr&amp;sig=_7NT_42ES4XXK8iXz02Necg5W9c#PPA103,M1 ''Joseph Barbera, Henry Moller'', Dreaming, Virtual Reality, and Presence].&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who argue that the world is not simulated must concede that the mind—at least the sleeping mind—is not itself an entirely reliable mechanism for attempting to differentiate reality from illusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WD0-45MGTWX-N&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=23fdaaef820b1ccd4be0982568286789 ''Giuliana A. L. Mazzoni and Elizabeth F. Loftus'', When Dreams Become Reality].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote| Whatever I have accepted until now as most true has come to me through my senses. But occasionally I have found that they have deceived me, and it is unwise to trust completely those who have deceived us even once.|||René Descartes&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfbits/dm1.pdf Meditations on First Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Critical discussion ==
In the past, philosophers [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] have separately attempted to refute Descartes's account of the dream argument. Locke claimed that you cannot experience pain in dreams. Various scientific studies conducted within the last few decades provided evidence against Locke's claim by concluding that pain in dreams can occur but the pain isn't as severe{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Philosopher Ben Springett has said that Locke might respond to this by stating that the agonising pain of stepping in to a fire is non-comparable to stepping in to a fire in a dream. Hobbes claimed that dreams are susceptible to absurdity while the waking life is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dreaming/#SH1b|title=Dreaming, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary philosophers have attempted to refute dream skepticism in detail (see, e.g., Stone (1984)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Jim|year=1984|title=Dreaming and Certainty|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=45|issue=3|pages=353–368|doi=10.1007/BF00355443|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/STODAC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Sosa]] (2007) devoted a chapter of a monograph to the topic, in which he presented a new theory of dreaming and argued that his theory raises a new argument for skepticism, which he attempted to refute. In ''A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge'', he states: "in dreaming we do not really believe; we only make-believe."&lt;ref&gt;Sosa, Ernest (2007). A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-929702-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Ichikawa (2008) and Nathan Ballantyne &amp; Ian Evans (2010) have offered critiques of Sosa's proposed solution. Ichikawa argued that as we cannot tell whether our beliefs in waking life are truly beliefs and not imaginings, like in a dream, we are still not able to tell whether we are awake or dreaming.

[[Norman Malcolm]] in his monograph "Dreaming" (published in 1959) elaborated on Wittgenstein's question as to whether it really mattered if people who tell dreams "really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking".  He argues that the sentence "I am asleep" is a senseless form of words; that dreams cannot exist independently of the waking impression; and that scepticism based on dreaming "comes from confusing the historical and dream telling senses...[of]...the past tense". (page 120).  In the chapter: "Do I Know I Am Awake ?" he argues that we do not have to say: "I know that I am awake" simply because it would be absurd to deny that one is awake.

The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's [[personal horizon]]: what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J.J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eavesdropping''' is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private [[conversation]] or [[communication]]s of others without their consent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garner, p. 550{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal.

==Etymology==
The verb ''eavesdrop'' is a back-formation from the noun ''eavesdropper'' ("a person who eavesdrops"), which was formed from the related noun ''eavesdrop'' ("the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop|title=eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries, ''Inside the Court of Henry VIII'' (April 8, 2015)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Court of Henry VIII|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/inside-court-henry-viii/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace'' (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss "eavedrops", carved wooden figures [[Henry VIII]] had built into the [[eaves]] (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of [[Hampton Court]] to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King's wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stollznow, Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=August 7, 2014|title=Eavesdropping: etymology, meaning, and some creepy little statues|url=http://karenstollznow.com/eavesdropping/|website=KarenStollznow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include [[telephone]] lines, [[cellular network|cellular networks]], [[email]], and other methods of private instant messaging. [[VoIP]] communications software is also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping via infections such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small ''packets'' from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers; however, government agencies, such as the [[National Security Agency]], have also been connected.

The '''El Greco fallacy''' is typically a perceptive [[fallacy]], where it is assumed that particular perceptual abnormalities will influence interactions with the world of a similar nature. It is named after an erroneous explanation for the vertically distorted painting style of [[El Greco]], which held that the artist must have seen the world as distorted by a peculiar [[astigmatism]], and thus painted this distorted world. This theoretical astigmatism cannot explain El Greco's style though, as he would have seen his canvases distorted in the same way, and painting onto them would have cancelled out any distortion.

It is believed the term originated with [[Irvin Rock]], in his 1966 book, ''The Nature of Perceptual Adaptation''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firestone|first=Chaz|date=2013|title=On the origin and status of the ‘El Greco fallacy’|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255791390_On_the_origin_and_status_of_the_El_Greco_Fallacy|journal=Perception|volume=42|issue=6|pages=672–674|doi=10.1068/p7488|issn=1468-4233|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Perceptual Adaptation|last=Rock|first=Irvin|publisher=Basic Books|year=1966|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When explored in experiment — by having subjects wear distorting lenses — it seems likely that El Greco would have completely adapted to seeing a distorted world, and this could not have been an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anstis|first=Stuart M.|date=2002|title=Was El Greco Astigmatic?|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/19805|journal=Leonardo|volume=35|issue=2|page=208|pages=|doi=10.1162/00240940252940612|issn=1530-9282|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In perception research ==
Chaz Firestone and Brian Scholl have alleged that this fallacy has been the cause for mistaken thinking in perception research,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firestone|first=Chaz|last2=Scholl|first2=Brian J.|date=2014|title=‘Top-down’ effects where none should be found: the El Greco fallacy in perception research|url=http://perception.research.yale.edu/papers/14-Firestone-Scholl-PsychSci-ElGreco.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|volume=25|issue=1|pages=38–46|doi=10.1177/0956797613485092|issn=1467-9280|pmid=24297777|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in studies that presumed to show that wearing a heavy backpack makes hills literally appear steeper, or holding rods outstretched horizontally would make doorways look narrower.

In the example of holding rods outstretched, the original experiment had subjects evaluate the width of apertures (intended to simulate doorways), then show this width on a ruler held by experimenters. The width was evaluated as narrower by those holding rods than those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stefanucci|first=Jeanine K.|last2=Geuss|first2=Michael N.|date=2009-01-01|title=Big people, little world: the body influences size perception|journal=Perception|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1782–1795|issn=0301-0066|pmc=3298356|pmid=20192128|doi=10.1068/p6437}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Firestone and Scholl repeated this experiment, substituting rulers for a separate aperture that was adjusted by experimenters to the subjects instruction, the aperture was still evaluated as narrower. This narrowing effect was later implied to be a [[Demand characteristics|demand characteristic]] after another group was told that their holding a rod was an evaluation of balance abilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Woman collapses in the East Village of New York.jpg|thumb|Emergency Medical Technician  treating a woman who has collapsed in the street in New York. Dangers to life and health are serious enough that emergency response systems are considered vital.]]
An '''emergency''' is a situation that poses an immediate risk to [[health]], [[life]], [[property]], or [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Advice on Definition of an Emergency |url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606230917/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.

While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a [[natural disaster]] that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency.
The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the [[government]], whose agencies ([[emergency service]]s) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

==Defining an emergency==
An incident, to be an emergency, conforms to one or more of the following: if it:
* Poses an immediate threat to [[life]], [[health]], [[property]], or environment
* Has already caused loss of life, health detriments, property damage, or environmental damage
* has a high [[probability]] of escalating to cause immediate danger to life, health, property, or environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

In the United States, most states mandate that a notice be printed in each telephone book that requires that someone must relinquish use of a phone line, if a person requests the use of a telephone line (such as a [[party line (telephony)|party line]]) to report an emergency.   State statutes typically define an ''emergency'' as, "...a condition where life, health, or property is in jeopardy, and the prompt summoning of aid is essential."&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of state statutes defining ''emergency'' for this purpose: California Penal Code, Sec. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most emergency services agree on protecting [[human]] health, life and property, the environmental impacts are not considered sufficiently important by some agencies{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.  This also extends to areas such as [[animal welfare]], where some emergency organizations cover this element through the "property" definition, where animals owned by a person are threatened (although this does not cover wild animals).   This means that some agencies do not mount an "emergency" response where it endangers wild animals or environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}, though others respond to such incidents (such as oil spills at sea that threaten marine life).  The attitude of the agencies involved is likely to reflect the predominant opinion of the government of the area.

==Types of emergency==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}

===Dangers to life===
Many emergencies cause an immediate danger to the life of people involved.  This can range from emergencies affecting a single person, such as the entire range of [[Medical emergency|medical emergencies]] including [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[stroke]]s, [[cardiac arrest]] and [[Physical trauma|trauma]], to incidents that affect large numbers of people such as [[natural disaster]]s including [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[mudslide]]s and outbreaks of diseases such as [[cholera]], [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]], and [[malaria]].

Most agencies consider these the highest priority emergency, which follows the general school of thought that nothing is more important than human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/emergresponse.pdf |title=UK Government document stating that life-saving activity is the highest priority in an emergency |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606232027/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/emergresponse.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers to health===
Some emergencies are not necessarily immediately threatening to life, but might have serious implications for the continued health and well-being of a person or persons (though a health emergency can subsequently escalate to life-threatening).

The causes of a health emergency are often very similar to the causes of an emergency threatening to life, which includes medical emergencies and natural disasters, although the ''range'' of incidents that can be categorized here is far greater than those that cause a danger to life (such as broken limbs, which do not usually cause death, but immediate intervention is required if the person is to recover properly). Many life emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, are also health emergencies.

===Dangers to the environment===

Some emergencies do not immediately endanger life, health or property, but do affect the natural environment and creatures living within it.  Not all agencies consider this a genuine emergency, but it can have far-reaching effects on animals and the long term condition of the land.  Examples would include [[forest fire]]s and marine [[oil spill]]s.

==Systems of classifying emergencies==
Agencies across the world have different systems for classifying incidents, but all of them serve to help them allocate finite resource, by prioritising between different emergencies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The first stage of any classification is likely to define whether the incident qualifies as an emergency, and consequently if it warrants an emergency response. Some agencies may still respond to non-emergency calls, depending on their remit and availability of resource.  An example of this would be a fire department responding to help retrieve a cat from a tree, where no life, health or property is immediately at risk.

Following this, many agencies assign a sub-classification to the emergency, prioritising incidents that have the most potential for risk to life, health or property (in that order).  For instance, many ambulance services use a system called the [[Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System]] (AMPDS) or a similar solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_fire/rescue_division/general_info/advanced_medical_priority_dispatch.asp |title=Tampa Fire Department EMS dispatch details |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505220614/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_fire/rescue_division/general_info/advanced_medical_priority_dispatch.asp |archivedate=May 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/helpweoffer/help1.html |title=London Ambulance Service details of AMPDS use |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130163345/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/helpweoffer/help1.html |archivedate=2007-01-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AMPDS categorises all calls to the ambulance service using it as  either 'A' category (immediately life-threatening), 'B' Category (immediately health threatening) or 'C' category (non-emergency call that still requires a response).  Some services have a fourth category, where they believe that no response is required after clinical questions are asked.

Another system for prioritizing medical calls is known as Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911dispatch.com/info/emd/index.html|title=EMD Resources|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.utah.gov/ems/stdseval/training/emd_curriculum_trainee.pdf |title=EMD Training Guide |publisher=Utah Bureau of Emergency Medical Services |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925174249/http://health.utah.gov/ems/stdseval/training/emd_curriculum_trainee.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jurisdictions that use EMD typically assign a code of "alpha" (low priority), "bravo" (medium priority), "charlie" (requiring [[paramedic|advanced life support]]), delta (high priority, requiring [[advanced life support]]) or "echo" (maximum possible priority, e.g., witnessed cardiac arrests) to each inbound request for service; these codes are then used to determine the appropriate level of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/ems/files/demsocreport2005.txt|title=DEMSOC Annual Report - 2005|publisher=Delaware Emergency Medical Services Oversight Council|year=2005|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/JOURNAL/articles/UsingECHO.html |title=Using the ECHO Determinant |author=Brian Dale |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075414/http://www.emergencydispatch.org/JOURNAL/articles/UsingECHO.html |archivedate=September 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/articles/themostofEMS.htm|title=EMD: Making the Most of EMS|author=Jeff J. Clawson|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other systems (especially as regards [[Emergency management|major incident]]s) use objective measures to direct resource.  Two such systems are [[CHALET|SAD CHALET]] and [[ETHANE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40001331|title=Patient Plus reference to CHALET and ETHANE systems|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are both mnemonics to help emergency services staff classify incidents, and direct resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leslp.gov.uk/firstoff.htm |title=London Emergency planning committee use of CHALET |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626114729/http://www.leslp.gov.uk/firstoff.htm |archivedate=2007-06-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these acronyms helps ascertain the number of casualties (usually including the number of dead and number of non-injured people involved), how the incident has occurred, and what emergency services are required.

==Agencies involved in dealing with emergencies==

{{main article|Emergency service}}

Most developed countries have a number of [[emergency service]]s operating within them, whose purpose is to provide assistance in dealing with any emergency.  They are often government operated, paid for from [[tax]] revenue as a public service, but in some cases, they may be private companies, responding to emergencies in return for payment, or they may be voluntary organisations, providing the assistance from funds raised from [[donation]]s.

Most developed countries operate three core emergency services{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}:

* '''[[Police]]''' – handle mainly [[crime]]-related emergencies.
* '''[[Fire department|Fire]]''' – handle [[fire]]-related emergencies and usually possess secondary rescue duties.
* '''[[Emergency Medical Service|Medical]]''' – handle [[Medicine|medical]]-related emergencies.

There may also be a number of specialized emergency services, which may be a part of one of the core agencies, or may be separate entities who assist the main agencies. This can include services, such as [[bomb disposal]], [[search and rescue]], and [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] operations.

The Military and the [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service]] (ARES) or [[Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service]] (RACES) help in large emergencies such as a disaster or major civil unrest.

=== Summoning emergency services ===
{{main article|Emergency telephone number}}
Most countries have an [[emergency telephone number]], also known as the universal emergency number, which can be used to summon the emergency services to any incident.  This number varies from country to country (and in some cases by region within a country), but in most cases, they are in a short number format, such as [[9-1-1|911]] (United States and many parts of Canada),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nena.org/|title=US National Emergency Number Association|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (United Kingdom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.org.uk/advice/999history.htm |title=History of the 999 System |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528022735/http://www.fire.org.uk/advice/999history.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/999/index.htm |title=Metropolitan Police advice on using 999 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609160248/http://www.met.police.uk/999/index.htm |archivedate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1-1-2|112]] (Europe)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/ind_guidelines/emer1002.htm |title=UK government advice on the use of 112 alongside 999 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403072801/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/ind_guidelines/emer1002.htm |archivedate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf |title=European Commission document on the Implementation of the Single 112 emergency number |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614210603/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[000]] (Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emergencycalls.aca.gov.au/ |title=Australian Government Advice on Emergency Calls |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531230159/http://www.emergencycalls.aca.gov.au/ |archivedate=2007-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of mobile phones also dial the emergency services, even if the phone keyboard is locked, or if the phone has an expired or missing [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]], although the provision of this service varies by country and network.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

=== Civil emergency services ===

In addition to those services provided specifically for emergencies, there may be a number of agencies who provide an emergency service as an incidental part of their normal 'day job' provision. This can include [[public utility]] workers, such as in provision of [[electricity]] or [[gas]], who may be required to respond quickly, as both utilities have a large potential to cause danger to life, health and property if there is an infrastructure failure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Gas/Safety/Emergency|title=UK National Gas Emergency Number|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file33246.pdf |title=UK Government Gas and Electricity National Emergency Plan |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610203937/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file33246.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic emergency services===

Generally perceived as pay per use emergency services, domestic emergency services are small, medium or large businesses who tend to emergencies within the boundaries of licensing or capabilities. These tend to consist of emergencies where health or property is perceived to be at risk but may not qualify for official emergency response. Domestic emergency services are in principal similar to civil emergency services where public or private utility workers will perform corrective repairs to essential services and avail their service at all times; however, these are at a cost for the service. An example would be an emergency plumber &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.silvaplumbing.com.au/"| 24-hour-emergency-plumbing-repairs. Retrieved 29/09/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency action principles (EAP)==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Emergency action principles are key 'rules' that guide the actions of rescuers and potential rescuers.  Because of the inherent nature of emergencies, no two are likely to be the same, so emergency action principles help to guide rescuers at incidents, by sticking to some basic tenets.

The adherence to (and contents of) the principles by would-be rescuers varies widely based on the [[training]] the people involved in emergency have received, the support available from emergency services (and the time it takes to arrive) and the emergency itself.

===Key emergency principle===

The key [[principle]] taught in almost all [[systems]] is that the [[rescue]]r, be they a lay person or a [[professional]], should [[Risk assessment|assess]] the situation for [[Risk|danger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg347.pdf|title=UK Health and Safety Executive publication on dealing with emergencies - Danger assessment is the first point|accessdate=2007-05-30|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/first-aid-advice/life-saving-procedures/primary-survey.aspx|title=St John Ambulance UK Primary Assessment guide|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that an assessment for danger is given such high priority is that it is core to emergency [[management]] that rescuers do not become secondary victims of any incident, as this creates a further emergency that must be dealt with.

A typical assessment for danger would involve [[observation]] of the [[wikt:surroundings|surroundings]], starting with the cause of the [[accident]] (e.g. a falling object) and expanding outwards to include any situational [[hazard]]s (e.g. fast moving traffic) and history or secondary information given by [[witnesses]], bystanders or the emergency services (e.g. an [[attacker]] still waiting nearby).

Once a primary danger assessment has been complete, this should not end the system of checking for danger, but should inform all other parts of the process.

If at any time the risk from any hazard poses a significant danger (as a factor of [[likelihood]] and seriousness) to the rescuer, they should consider whether they should approach the scene (or leave the scene if appropriate).

==Managing an emergency==
[[File:Em cycle.png|right|thumb|A graphic representation of the four phases in emergency management.]]
{{main article|Emergency management}}
There are many emergency services protocols that apply in an emergency, which usually start with planning before an emergency occurs. One commonly used system for demonstrating the phases is shown here on the right.

The planning phase starts at '''preparedness''', where the agencies decide how to respond to a given incident or set of circumstances.  This should ideally include lines of command and control, and division of activities between agencies.  This avoids potentially negative situations such as three separate agencies all starting an official [[emergency shelter]] for victims of a disaster.

Following an emergency occurring, the agencies then move to a '''response''' phase, where they execute their plans, and may end up improvising some areas of their response (due to gaps in the planning phase, which are inevitable due to the individual nature of most incidents).

Agencies may then be involved in '''recovery''' following the incident, where they assist in the clear up from the incident, or help the people involved overcome their mental trauma.

The final phase in the circle is '''mitigation''', which involves taking steps to ensure no re-occurrence is possible, or putting additional plans in place to ensure less damage is done.  This should feed back into the preparedness stage, with updated plans in place to deal with future emergencies, thus completing the circle.

==State of emergency==
{{main article|State of emergency}}

In the event of a major incident, such as civil unrest or a major disaster, many governments maintain the right to declare a [[state of emergency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldbills/077/04077.12-18.html|title=UK Government Civil Contingencies Act, giving powers to declare a state of emergency|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives them extensive powers over the daily lives of their citizens, and may include temporary curtailment on certain [[civil rights]], including the right to trial. For instance to discourage [[looting]] of an evacuated area, a shoot on sight policy, however unlikely to occur, may be publicized.

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Heat]], a form of energy, is partly [[potential energy]] and partly [[kinetic energy]]]]

'''Energy quality''' is the contrast between different [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], the different [[trophic level]]s in [[ecology|ecological]] systems and the propensity of [[energy]] to convert from one form to another. The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or [[qualia]], of different energy forms as they [[Energy flow (ecology)|flow]] and transform. It appeals to our common [[perception]] of the [[heat]] value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy [[physical state]] and energy. For example the transition from a [[solid]] state to [[liquid]] may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.

==Introduction==
Since before [[ancient history|antiquity]] there has been deep [[philosophical]], [[aesthetic]] and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with [[quantity]]. In some respects the history of [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] thought can be characterized by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no "rational quality", or [[quale]] ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, [[spirituality]], and [[astrology]] to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by [[scientific methods]], and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand.

At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their [[opposable thumb]]. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and [[genome]] [[structure]], while others chose [[energetics|energetic]] function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide.

==Ohta==

According to Ohta (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] under the concept of "availability". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, "die Exergie" (the [[exergy]]). It was later continued and standardised in [[Japan]]. [[Exergy]] analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in [[steam power]] [[engineering]] industry. Here the "quality index" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of [[Value theory|value]] – for example A. Thumann wrote, "The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'" (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;113) – which brings into play the question of [[teleology]] and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy "with a built-in measure of quality like energy" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;392).

==Energy quality evaluation methods==
There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process.

'''Receiver methods:''' view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Transition_in_Energy_Use/transitions-euse-ene_encyclop_2004.pdf] used two types of indicators of energetic quality ''pars pro toto'': the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the [[carbon intensity]] of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a [[hydrogen production]] system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;125).

'''Donor methods:''' view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality ''is'' upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the ''usefulness'' of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy.

==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) ==
===Constant energy form but variable energy flow===
T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the [[Energy#Forms of energy|form of energy]] remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of  energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.

===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow===
The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the '''transformation''' of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the '''relative ease''' with which the energy transforms, from form to form.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nomenclature:''' Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing "energy A", like Ohta above, Culp referred to "J&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;", to specify electrical form of energy, where" J" refers to "energy", and the "''e''"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript.

==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)==
The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of [[biophysical economics]] energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with [[embodied energy]] methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the "Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator." (2006; p.&amp;nbsp;10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input.

==Ranking energy quality==
===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position===

Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p.&amp;nbsp;90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of "relative ease" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, "the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, "the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist." (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in [http://www.exergy.se/ftp/japan85.pdf Wall's article] for another example ranking of energy quality).

===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank===

Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodyanmics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called [[transformity]]: "the [[Emergy|EMERGY]] per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule" (H.T.Odum 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;1135).

'''Arizona Proposition 203''', also known as '''English for the Children''', is a ballot initiative that was passed by 63% of Arizona voters on November 7, 2000. It limited the type of instruction available to English language learner (ELL) students. Before Proposition 203, schools were free in terms of ELL instruction to use bilingual or immersion methods. According to a cover letter from the Arizona Department of Education Superintendent of Public Instruction [[Lisa Graham Keegan]] to the Arizona Legislature, it was impossible to make a correct analysis regarding how many students were learning through English as a second language programs, as opposed to bilingual education. The school districts had submitted "conflicting information," and 40% had not submitted any data, in spite of three deadline extensions. &lt;ref&gt;Lisa Graham Keegan, "English Acquisition Services: A Summary of Bilingual Programs and English as a Second Language Programs for School Year 1997-8," ''Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Arizona Legislature,'' January 1999, cover letter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposition 203, like the similar California Proposition 227, was named after its financial supporter Ron Unz, a [[Silicon Valley]] software entrepreneur.  61% of the voters had passed Proposition 227. Arizona, Massachusetts, and Colorado followed with similar campaigns directed by Unz. On November 5, 2002, Question 2 in Massachusetts was passed by 68% of the voters, but Amendment 31 in Colorado was rejected by 56% of the voters. Unz's goal was to replace bilingual education with structured or sheltered English immersion programs.  The book ''English for the Children: Mandated by the People, Skewed by Politicians and Special Interests'' by Johanna J. Haver (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013) reconstructs the politics surrounding Unz's movement and its effects on the education of ELLs.

==Content==
The actual text of the legislation begins with declarations regarding the importance of English and learning English. It goes on to state that immigrant parents want their children to acquire "a good knowledge of English," allowing them to "fully participate in the American dream." It explains that the government and Arizona public schools have a moral responsibility to "provide all of Arizona's children... with the skills necessary to become productive members of our society." It elaborates that public schools "currently do an inadequate job of educating immigrant children" by "experimental language programs whose failure over the past two decades is demonstrated by the current high drop-out rates and low English literacy levels of many immigrant children." It makes the point that "young immigrant children can easily acquire full fluency in a new language, such as English, if they are heavily exposed to that language in the classroom at an early age." &lt;ref&gt;Maria Mendoza and Hector Ayala, "English Language Education for Children in Public Schools, AZ Prop 203," January 6, 1999, English for the Children, www.onenation.org/aztext.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution states that "all children in Arizona public schools shall be taught English as rapidly and effectively as possible." ELLs should be educated in immersion programs during a temporary transition period "not normally intended to exceed one year." A parent may request for his or her child to be exempt if it can be determined that the child already knows English, the child is ten years old or older, or the child is identified as having special needs. However, for a child to claim to have special needs, it must be confirmed that education in English is not the best option for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Mendoza and Hector Ayala, "English Language Education for Children in Public Schools, AZ Prop 203," January 6, 1999, English for the Children, www.onenation.org/aztext.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
[[The New York Times|The ''New York Times'']] ran a front-page story in August prior to the November 2000 election, showing that California's version of the initiative, Proposition 227, had been highly successful, with a rise in standardized test scores among English language learners after two years.&lt;ref&gt; Jacques Steinberg, "Increase in Test Scores Counters Dire Forecasts for Bilingual Ban," August 20, 2000, www.onenation.org/008/082000.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of noted bilingual education theorists' arguments, disputing the particulars of the article, the ''Times'' story is believed to have strongly affected public opinion and the passage of Arizona Proposition 203.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna J. Haver, ''English for the Children'' (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Implementation of the policy was scheduled to occur at the beginning of the 2001-2002 school year. There was widespread confusion throughout the state because of differences of opinion regarding the language used in the text of the proposition. Following the implementation, some schools changed their approach to educating ELLs, but several districts obtained waivers for their ELL students and continued their bilingual education programs. For the most part, neither the bilingual nor the immersion programs were in compliance with the law. Fewer than 11% of the state's ELL students achieved proficiency in a year's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, K., Thompson, M., &amp; MacSwan, J. (2004).

'''Europe a Nation''' was a policy developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Fascist]] politician [[Oswald Mosley]] as the cornerstone of his [[Union Movement]]. It called for the integration of [[Europe]] into a [[polity|single political entity]]. Although the idea failed to gain widespread support for the Union Movement, it nonetheless proved highly influential on the [[far-right]] thought in Europe.

==Origins==
The idea of a united Europe began to develop in the final days of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Concepts such as ''Nation Europa'' and ''Eurafrika'', both of which looked for an ever-closer union between European countries, gained some currency in the German far-right underground in the immediate aftermath of the [[Second World War]]. Mosley, who towards the end of the war had learned to read the [[German language]], read a number of pamphlets discussing these ideas and was strongly influenced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Another important influence was [[Benito Mussolini]]'s manifesto of the [[Italian Social Republic]], which included a call for the establishment of a European Community.&lt;ref name="Harris31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Mosley would later claim that he had first advocated something akin to Europe a Nation in speeches as early as 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Mosley]], ''My Life'', Nelson, 1970, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, however, [[British Union of Fascists]] policy at any time.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Development==
Mosley first presented his idea of Europe forming a single state in his book ''The Alternative'' in 1947.&lt;ref name="Mack36"&gt;Macklin, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the traditional vision of nationalism that had been followed by the various shades of pre-war fascism had been too narrow in scope and that the post-war era required a new paradigm in which Europe would come together as a single state.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected any notion of a [[federal Europe]], instead calling for full integration.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'', Random House, 2011, pp. 330-331&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Mosley insisted that a supranational European state was essential to the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was presented to the wider electorate in October 1948 when Mosley called for elections to a European Assembly as the first step towards his vision.&lt;ref name="Harris31"&gt;Harris, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion also had an important [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] dimension as Mosley saw it as the only defence against Europe becoming the scene of the power struggles between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the racial kinship between the Germanic peoples of Europe, whom he defined as the Germans, British, Scandinavians and northern French, would be the basis for unity, whilst also declaring his admiration for the contributions of the Latin peoples to Europe's cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

He was opposed to both the [[United Nations]] and its predecessor the [[League of Nations]], dismissing both as part of a Jewish plot to undermine nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Europe a Nation was to include an [[anti-Semitic]] dimension, with the entire Jewish population of Europe to be expelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where they could decide their own fate.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa, most of which was still in the hands of the European colonial empires, was to be retained by the united Europe as a giant colony, with [[apartheid]] implemented on a continental basis, effectively excluding Blacks from Europe.&lt;ref name="Harris31"/&gt; Notions of any indigenous rule in Africa were excluded altogether from the idea.&lt;ref name="Thur245"/&gt; With [[autarky]] a central aim of Europe a Nation, Africa was to be exploited by the new state for its mineral and food resources. In this aspect, Mosley was heavily influenced by the works of [[Anton Zischka]].&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosley subsequently built upon the policy by calling for the European state to have its prices and incomes regulated by a "wage price mechanism", whilst also calling for "European Socialism", a syndical style organisation basis for the continent's industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively though the vision he presented was one that was highly steeped in [[corporatism]] and [[elitism]].&lt;ref name="Mack82"&gt;Macklin, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were to be corporatist in nature with an occupation-based franchise (previously a British Union of Fascists policy) whilst "European Socialism" was to include an effective free hand for business leaders but the co-ordination of workers in bodies called "labour Charters", a policy borrowed from the Fascist Italy.&lt;ref name="Mack82"/&gt;

Mosley summed up the arguments himself by stating that 'no lesser degree of union than that of an integral nation can give the will and power to act on the great scale.... No lesser space than all Europe, and the overseas possessions of Europe in a common pool, can give the room within which to act effectively'.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Mosley, 'European Socialism', ''The European'', May 1956&lt;/ref&gt; However Europe a Nation drew heavily on the existing heritage of fascism and indeed Graham Macklin has argued that it "merely adapted and enlarged the parameters of his fascist panacea to suit the times, and is thus easily recognisable as 'Fascist'".&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Within the UK, the notion of Europe a Nation largely failed to attract the younger far-right activists, most of whom deserted Mosley in favour of the [[League of Empire Loyalists]] (LEL) and other more minor and more extreme groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, pp. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.K. Chesterton]], who went on to lead the LEL, was a strong critic of Europe a Nation from 1947 when ''The Alternative'' was first published, preferring to emphasise [[British nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Mack36"/&gt;

The policy also failed to capture the minds of the British electorate, with the Union Movement enjoying comparative success in voting terms only when they emphasised more basic anti-immigrant rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Thur245"&gt;Thurlow, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Alexander Raven Thomson]], one of Mosley's closest lieutenants and noted for his sycophantic attitudes towards his leader, eventually told Mosley in 1950 that Europe a Nation held little attraction to British voters. As a consequence, the Union Movement briefly downplayed the idea, although Thomson's preferred alternative, [[neo-Nazism]], was soon abandoned as well when it proved equally unpalatable to the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the wider European far-right, however, Europe a Nation did gain some wider currency. [[Fritz Rössler]], at the time going by the alias Dr. Franz Richter, became an enthusiastic supporter of the idea and attempted to make it [[Deutsche Reichspartei]] policy. He failed in this attempt and was expelled from the party, decamping to the [[Socialist Reich Party]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; For a time it also had the support of [[Adolf von Thadden]], who helped Mosley to organise the [[National Party of Europe]], a largely failed attempt to build a continental Europe a Nation political party.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately however the plan's main supporter in Germany proved to be [[Arthur Erhardt]], who established the journal ''[[Nation Europa]]'' to support far-right pan-European nationalist ideas, to which Mosley was a frequent contributor.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Germany it also gained some currency within the [[Italian Social Movement]], although by the early 1950s that wing of the party lost influence, the Italian nationalist arm gaining supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas would later be developed by [[Jean-François Thiriart]] and others interested in [[Europeanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', Warner Books, 1998, pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Europe a Nation was also an important influence on the thinking of [[Alain de Benoist]] and in particular the work of the think tank ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'' which he established in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Existential phenomenology''' is [[Martin Heidegger]]'s brand of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/phenomenological-movement/existential-phenomenology "Phenomenological movement: 4. Existential phenomenology].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In contrast with his former mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], Heidegger (in his ''[[Being and Time]]'') put [[ontology]] before [[epistemology]] and thought that phenomenology would have to be based on an observation and analysis of ''[[Dasein]]'' ("being-there"), human being, investigating the fundamental ontology of the ''Lebenswelt'' ([[lifeworld]], Husserl's term) underlying all so-called regional ontologies of the special sciences. In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]], Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of ''Dasein'' existentially (''existenzial''), rather than [[existentiell]]y (''existenziell'') because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with "penetrating fashion".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Development==
Besides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frantz Fanon]],  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Enzo Paci|it}} and [[Samuel Todes]].

==Other disciplines==
Existential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines. For example, [[Leo Steinberg]]'s essay "[[The Philosophical Brothel]]" describes Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in a perspective that is existential-phenomenological. It has also impacted [[architectural theory]], especially in the phenomenological and Heideggerian approaches to space, place, dwelling, technology, etc.&lt;ref&gt;This is evident in the works of [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], as for example is the case with his book: ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), or more recently with the numerous papers of [[Nader El-Bizri]] such as his paper: 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' Volume 60 (2015): 5–30. This is also felt with the practices of architects in the [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] movement&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''F-rating''' is a rating to highlight women on screen and behind the camera.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;
Developed at [[Bath Film Festival]] in 2014, the '''F-rating''' was inspired by the [[Bechdel test|Bechdel Test]] based on a 1985 cartoon strip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/the-rule|title=dykestowatchoutfor.com  » Blog Archive   » The Rule|website=dykestowatchoutfor.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alison Bechdel]], and popularised in the 2010s by [[Anita Sarkeesian]]'s Feminist Frequency blog, and by Ellen Tejle's A-rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-listfilm.com/ A-rating]&lt;/ref&gt; in Swedish cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |title=We talk to: Ellen Tejle founder of A Rate! |work=The Bechdel Test Fest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521164412/http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |archivedate=2015-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms of the A-rating, Swedish film theorists Ingrid Ryberg, Anu Koivunen and Laura Horak wrote, "The A rating has proved to be an activist provocation that works, and it is important to ask why... The A rating is not about classifying films as feminist or not feminist. It aims to alert viewers who find female sociality compelling to films they might like, and so challenge the industry to make more such films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/swedish-cinema-bechdel-test-works|title=Swedish cinema's use of the Bechdel test is a provocation that works|author=Anu Koivunen|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival developed the F-rating in October 2014 "to take it a step further and highlight films which either had a senior figure in production who was female—a director or a screenwriter—or had very strong female leads or women's issues," according to festival director and F-rating founder Holly Tarquini.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bath-film-festival-2014-movies-with-strong-female-credentials-to-receive-special-frated-certificate-9849238.html|title=Bath Film Festival 2014: Movies with strong female credentials to receive special F-rated certificate|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarquini told the [[BBC]] that films had to meet at least one of three criteria to receive the rating: "If our films have a female director, a female lead who is not simply there to support the male lead, or are specifically about women then they will receive an F-rated stamp of approval." &lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-29739874|title='F-rated' films shown at Bath Film Festival|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the F-rated founder, Holly Tarquini was invited to deliver a TED talk at TEDxYouth@Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Stories Shape Us {{!}} Holly Tarquini {{!}} TEDxYouth@Bath|date=2016-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMEajG_cvC0&amp;t=1s|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The F-rating is a reaction to a phenomenon known as the [[celluloid ceiling]], which has been documented internationally. "[[British Film Institute|BFI]] figures showed that in 2011, 15% of all UK films released were directed by women, but in 2012, this went down to 7.8%.",&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; while a study by "the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found females made up 15 per cent of protagonists, 29 per cent of major characters and 30 per cent of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2013."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

==Bath Film Festival 2014: first implementation==

Seventeen of the forty-two films received the F-rating, included the First World War drama [[Testament of Youth]], based on [[Vera Brittain]]’s memoir, and director Jean-Marc Vallée’s true-life tale Wild, starring [[Reese Witherspoon]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/11/bath-film-festival-wild-f-rating-feminist-films|title=Bath film festival goes Wild with F rating for feminist films|author=Ben Child|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's magazines Marie Claire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/547748/bath-film-festival-f-rating-given-to-films-with-strong-female-leads.html|title=Bath Film Festival: 'F' Rating Given To Films With Strong Female Leads - Marie Claire|work=Marie Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a19084/bath-film-festival-feminist-rating/|title=Bath Film Festival Announces 'F' Rating For Feminist Films|author=Diana Bruk|work=ELLE}}&lt;/ref&gt; both gave positive coverage to the rating and programme, which were also mentioned in UK Culture Minister [[Ed Vaizey]]'s weekly bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/festival-news/f-rated-goes-viral/|title=Bath Film Festival's F-Rating Goes Viral - Bath Film Festival|work=Bath Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent implementation==

In February 2015, the Bath Comedy Festival announced that it would be the UK's first F-rated comedy festival, with performers including [[Viv Groskop]] and [[Helen Lederer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathcomedy.com/f-rating|title=Bath Comedy Festival - F-Rating|work=bathcomedy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Komedia Bath arranged a meeting to encourage all Bath festivals, including the [[Bath Festival of Children's Literature]] and [[Bath International Music Festival]], and arts organisations to make [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] the first F-rated city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komedia.co.uk/bath/komedia-bath-bids-to-make-bath-the-first-f-rated-city/ |title=Komedia  » Blog Archive   » Komedia Bath bids to make Bath the first F-Rated city |work=komedia.co.uk }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Bath Film Festival programme was 45% F-rated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/07/Bath-Film-Festival-2015.pdf|title=Bath Film Festival 2015 programme|last=|first=|date=November 2015|website=bathfilmfestival.org.uk/|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted more attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34982615|title=Can F-rated films help overcome sexism in Hollywood?|last=Youngs|first=Ian|date=2015-12-04|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 all the independent cinemas and film festivals in the UK were invited to join the F-rating with dozens signing up to F-rated their programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/we-f-rate/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 The Barbican became the 40th organisation to adopt the rating.

==F-rated keyword added to IMDb==

In January 2017, the F-rated keyword was added to [[IMDb]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-39132867&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, there were over 22,400 films on IMDb tagged with the F-rated keyword.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=f-rated&lt;/ref&gt;

The rating was defended by [[GQ|GQ Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gq.com/story/please-dont-use-imdbs-new-feature-to-be-a-dick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Idea Networking Example.jpg|thumb|Idea Networking Example]]
The '''fan effect'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Retrieval of propositional information from long-term memory|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=October 1974|volume=6|issue=4|pages=451–474|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomenon under the branch of [[cognitive psychology]] where recognition times or error rate for a particular concept increases as more information about the concept is acquired. The word "fan" refers to the number of associations correlated with the concept.

== The origin of the fan effect ==
The fan effect first appeared in a series of experiments conducted by [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R. Anderson]], a cognitive psychologist, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radvansky|first=Gabriel A.|title=The Fan Effect: A Tale of Two Theories|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=June 1999|volume=128|issue=2|pages=198–206|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.2.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three experiments he conducted involved participants learning 26 sentences that paired a person with a location. Additionally, they were asked to determine whether or not a particular sentence that was given to them belonged to the 26 they were asked to study.  An example of a sentence Anderson used in his experiment was:  "A hippie is in the park." Some sentences seemed similar in the sense that a person was paired with another location. For instance, "A hippie is in the church." Results revealed that participants produced a longer retrieval time when a person was paired with more than one location. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that multiple associations, such as including a large number of nouns in a sentence, interfered with the recognition time by producing a much slower effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buntinga, M.F., Conwayb, A., and Heitzc, R.P.|title=Individual differences in the fan effect and working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=April 2004|volume=51|pages=604–621|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.07.007|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spreading activation==
In the brain, [[memory]] stores information in a network of nodes that are linked together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radvansky and Zacks|first=Gabriel and Rose|title=Mental Models and the Fan Effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1991|volume=17|issue=5|pages=940–953|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.17.5.940}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a memory is retrieved, activation spreads on the links until it intersects or enough time has passed. If there is one association, the activation only has to spread to a single link whereas multiple associations would divide the activation to many links. Because there are so many connections, it causes the brain to take a longer time to identify the concepts and retrieve the memory.

==Plausible theories==

Concepts can be better recognized by similar ideas instead of a random order of ideas. When stored in a random order, the concepts are placed in independent places in the brain instead of putting the concepts together as one unit. The fan effect can be reduced if random sentences are exposed frequently and unified into one concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moeser|first=Shannon Dawn|title=The Role of Experimental Design in Investigations of the Fan Effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory|date=March 1979|volume=5|issue=2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.5.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26041">{{essay-like|date=February 2018}}The '''feminine beauty ideal''' is "the socially constructed notion that physical attractiveness is one of women's most important assets, and something all women should strive to achieve and maintain".&lt;ref&gt;Spade, J. Z., &amp; Valentine, C. G. (2008). The kaleidoscope of gender: Prisms, patterns, and possibilities. Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine beauty ideals are rooted in [[heteronormative]] beliefs, and heavily influence women of all [[sexual orientations]]. The feminine beauty ideal, which also includes [[female body shape]], varies from culture to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to conform to a certain definition of "beautiful" can have drastic psychological effects. These ideals have been correlated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, and low [[self-esteem]], starting from an [[adolescent]] age and continuing into adulthood.

==In fairy tales==
The feminine beauty ideal is portrayed in many children's [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="spade" /&gt; It has been common in the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales for physical attractiveness in female characters to be rewarded.&lt;ref name="bakersperry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker-Sperry | first1 = L. | last2 = Grauerholz | first2 = L. | year = 2003 | title = The pervasiveness and persistence of the feminine beauty ideal in children's fairy tales | url = | journal = Gender &amp; Society | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 711–726 | doi=10.1177/0891243203255605}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those fairy tales, "beauty is often associated with being white, economically privileged, and virtuous."&lt;ref name="bakersperry" /&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales usually involve a beautiful heroine. In the story ''[[Snow White]]'', the protagonist Snow White is described as being "white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood" and "as beautiful as the light of day."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, J. &amp; Grimm, W. (1857). Snow White. Berlin: Children's and Household Tales.&lt;/ref&gt; This fairy tale is defining beauty as being [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] with rosy cheeks and black hair. On the other hand, the [[antagonist]] of Brothers Grimm fairy tales is frequently described as ugly, relating beauty with goodness and ugliness with evil.&lt;ref name="bakersperry" /&gt; Ultimately, this correlation puts an emphasis on the virtue of being beautiful, as defined by fairy tales.

Starting almost 100 years after the Grimm Brothers wrote their fairy tales, the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] adapted these tales into animated feature films. About 40 percent of [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] made from 1937-2000 had "only dominant cultural themes portrayed."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towbin | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Haddock | first2 = S.A. | last3 = Zimmerman | first3 = T.S. | last4 = Lund | first4 = L.K. | last5 = Tanner | first5 = L.R. | year = 2004 | title = Images of gender, race, age, and sexual orientation in Disney feature-length animated films | url = | journal = Journal of Feminist Family Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 19–44 | doi=10.1300/j086v15n04_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the majority of characters are white, "the expectation [is] that all people are or should be like this."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other common traits of female Disney characters are thin bodies with impossible bodily proportions, long, flowing hair, and large round eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unrealistic anatomies of Disney princesses revealed|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/unrealistic-anatomies-disney-princesses-revealed-article-1.1365387|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constant emphasis on female beauty and what constitutes as being beautiful contributes to the overall feminine beauty ideal.

==In mass media==
[[Mass media]] is one of the most powerful tools for young girls and women to learn and also understand feminine beauty ideals. As mass media develops, the way people see feminine beauty ideals changes, as does how females view themselves. "The average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day," says Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University.&lt;ref&gt;Heubeck, Girls and Body Image: Media's Effect, How Parents Can Help. WebMD. Retrieved October 26, 2013, from http://www.webmd.com/beauty/style/helping-girls-with-body-image&lt;/ref&gt; In most advertisements, female models are typically homogeneous in appearance. "Girls today are swamped by [ultra-thin] ideals not only in the form of dolls but also in comics, cartoons, TV, and advertising along with all the associated merchandising."&lt;ref name="Dittmar"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.283| title = Does Barbie make girls want to be thin?

Images of women can be virtually manipulated creating an ideal that is not only rare but also nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Networked bodies and extended corporealities: Theorizing the relationship between the body, embodiment, and contemporary new media.|last = White|first = Michele|date = 2009|journal = Feminist Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopedia of Gender in the Media'' states that "the postproduction techniques of airbrushing and computer-generated modifications 'perfect' the beauty myth by removing any remaining blemishes or imperfections visible to the eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender in Media|last = Kosut|first = Mary|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc. 2012|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, Calif :|pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements for products "such as diets, cosmetics, and exercise gear [help] the media construct a dream world of hopes and high standards that incorporates the glorification of slenderness and weight loss."&lt;ref name="Groesz"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/eat.10005| title = The effect of experimental presentation of thin media images on body satisfaction: A meta-analytic review| journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders| volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16| year = 2002| last1 = Groesz | first1 = L.

With a focus on an ideal physical appearance, the feminine beauty ideal distracts from female competency by prioritizing and valuing superficial characteristics related to beauty and appearance. When physical beauty is idealized and featured in the media, it reduces women to sexualized objects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oppressive Beliefs at Play: Associations Among Beauty Ideals and Practices and Individual Differences in Sexism, Objectification of Others, and Media Exposure|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1471-6402|pages = 365–379|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01582.x|first = Viren|last = Swami|first2 = Rebecca|last2 = Coles|first3 = Emma|last3 = Wilson|first4 = Natalie|last4 = Salem|first5 = Karolina|last5 = Wyrozumska|first6 = Adrian|last6 = Furnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the message across mass media that one's body is inadequate apart from sex appeal and connects concepts of beauty and sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Perfection is achieved by celebrities through photoshopped images that hide every blemish or flaw while also editing body parts to create the "ideal" hourglass body type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://girlsempowermentnetwork.org/blog/media-today-unattainable-beauty-standards/|title=Media Today: Unattainable Beauty Standards|last1=Davis|first1=Cameron|website=Girls Empowerment Network|publisher=GENautsin|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dove Beauty and Confidence Report'' interviewed 10,500 females across thirteen countries and found that women's confidence in their body image is steadily declining - regardless of age or geographic location. Despite these findings, there is a strong desire to fight existing beauty ideals. In fact, 71% of women and 67% of girls want the media to do a better job of portraying different types of women. Studies done by [https://www.dove.com/us/en/home.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_ODWBRCTARIsAE2_EvXfV2z63MzYDd9MrsO8AxoJM9mClWpDH2KOzUlazhewmQVCyh8Y7cUaAnPBEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds Dove] reveal low self esteem impacts women and girls' ability to release their true potential. 85% of women and 79% of girls admit they opt out of important life activities when they do not feel confident in the way they look. More than half of women (69%) and girls (65%) allude to pressure from the media and advertisements to become the world's version of beautiful, which is a driving force of appearance anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-dove-research-finds-beauty-pressures-up-and-women-and-girls-calling-for-change-583743391.html|title=New Dove Research Finds Beauty Pressures Up, and Women and Girls Calling for Change|website=CISION PR Newswire|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done by Dove have also revealed the following statistics: "4% of women consider themselves beautiful, 11% of girls globally are comfortable with describing themselves as beautiful, 72% of girls feel pressure to be beautiful, 80% of women agree that every woman has something about her that is beautiful, but do not see their own beauty, and that 54% of women agree that when it comes to how they look, they are their own worst beauty critic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/about-dove/our-research.html|title=Our Research|website=Dove|publisher=Dove|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online space such as [[Instagram]] that is based on interactions through pictures creates a focus on one’s physical appearance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title=‘Strong is the new skinny’: A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=https://doi-org.echo.louisville.edu/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1003–1011|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|issn=1359-1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to evidence gathered from a study focusing on general Instagram use in young women, researchers suggest Instagram usage was positively correlated with women’s [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This same study also considered the effect of Instagram on the internalization of the Western beauty ideal for women, and the evidence gathered in the study agrees with the idea that Instagram use encourages women to internalize the societal beauty ideal of Western culture. Because users have the opportunity to shape and edit their photographs before sharing them, they can force them to adhere to the beauty ideal.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Viewing these carefully selected pictures shows the extent to which women internalize the Western beauty ideal.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In addition to researching the effects of general Instagram use, the study also researched the effects of "fitspiration" Instagram pages on young women's body image. “Fitspiration” pages aim to motivate the viewer through images of healthy eating and exercising.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Although these pages aim to be a positive way to promote a healthy lifestyle, they are also appearance-based and contain images of toned and skinny women.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fardouly|first=Jasmine|last2=Willburger|first2=Brydie K|last3=Vartanian|first3=Lenny R|date=February 2017|title=Instagram use and young women’s body image concerns and self-objectification: Testing mediational pathways|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1461444817694499|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1380–1395|doi=10.1177/1461444817694499|issn=1461-4448|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, there is a positive correlation to young women’s viewing "fitspiration" pages and a negative body image.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A case study conducted about Instagram use and the Western feminine beauty ideal focused on the specific account @effyourbeautystandards, a body-positive Instagram page created by feminist plus-size model Tessa Holliday.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=Sofia P.|last2=De Ridder|first2=Sander|date=2017-10-01|title=Representing diverse femininities on Instagram: A case study of the body-positive @effyourbeautystandards Instagram account|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/cjcs/2017/00000009/00000002/art00010;jsessionid=3d1f41r4fgcp.x-ic-live-01|journal=Catalan Journal of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=321–337|doi=10.1386/cjcs.9.2.321_1|issn=1757-1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her page, Holliday instructed women to share pictures of themselves on Instagram with the hashtag #effyourbeautystandards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Images posted with this hashtag would be selected by the account administrators and posted to the @effyourbeauutystandards page.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The evidence gathered in this case study suggested that while these selected pictures attempt to take an intersectional approach to the content women view on social media, they may still have an effect on how women view their bodies.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Psychological effects==
Feminine beauty ideals have shown correlations to many psychological disorders, including lowered self-esteem and eating disorders. Western cultural standards of beauty and attractiveness promote unhealthy and unattainable body ideals that motivate women to seek perfection.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since 1972, there has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of women in the United States who experience dissatisfaction with their bodies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E. | last2 = Cole | first2 = S. | last3 = Chelberg | first3 = M.

M., Curran, D. J., &amp; Maier, S. L. (2012). Women, men, and society (6th ed.). Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been consistently found that perceived appearance is the single strongest predictor of global self-esteem among young adults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Awareness of the ideal female shape is linked to increasingly negative self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through peer interaction and an environment of continual comparison to those portrayed in the media, women are often made to feel inadequate, and thus their self-esteem can decrease from their negative self-image. A negative body image can result in adverse psychosocial consequences, including depression, poor self-esteem, and diminished quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T.

There is significant pressure for girls to conform to feminine beauty ideals, and, since thinness is prized as feminine, many women feel dissatisfied with their body shape. Body dissatisfaction has been found to be a precursor to serious psychological problems such as depression, social anxiety, and eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jefferson | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Stake | first2 = J. E. | year = 2009 | title = Appearance self-attitudes of African American and European American women: Media comparisons and internalization of beauty ideals | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 396–409 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine beauty ideal has influenced women, particularly younger women, to partake in extreme measures. Some of these extreme measures include  limiting their food intake, and participating in excessive physical activity to try to achieve what is considered the "ideal beauty standards". One aspect of the feminine beauty ideal includes having a thin waist, which is causing women to participate in these alarming behaviors. When trying to achieve these impossible standards, these dangerous practices are put into place. These practices can eventually lead to the woman developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. As achieving the "beauty ideal" becomes a more popular phenomenon, these eating disorders are becoming more prevalent, especially in young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazur|first=Allen|date=August 1986|title=U.S. Trends in Feminine Beauty and Overadaptation|url=http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/humans_web_04/beauty/feminine.pdf|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume= 22| issue =  3|pages= 281–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that magazine advertisements promoting dieting and thinness are far more prevalent in women's magazine than in men's magazine, and that female television characters are far more likely to be thin than male characters.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, L.

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest that this behavior strongly correlates with societal pressure for women to live up to the standards of beauty set by a culture obsessed with being thin.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Research has shown that people have subconsciously associated heavier body sizes with negative personality characteristics such as laziness and lack of self-control.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = P.

== Across cultures ==
There have been many ideas over time and across different cultures of what the feminine beauty "ideal" is for a woman's body image. How well a woman follows these beauty ideals can also influence her social status within her culture. Physically altering the body has been a custom in many areas of the world for a long time. For example, decorating the body with tattoos is a symbol of attractiveness and status in the Japanese culture. The art of irezumi, or covering a woman's back with tattoos, is still practiced today in Japan. In Burma, Padung girls from the age of about five years, have metal rings put around their necks. Additional rings are added to the girl's neck every two years. This practice is done to produce a giraffe like effect in women. This practice is dying out, but these women would eventually carry up to 24 rings around their necks. A neck with many rings was considered the "ideal" image of physical beauty in this culture. In Europe, the corset has been used over time to create a tiny waistline. In Europe, a tiny waistline was considered "ideal" for beauty. A practice in China involved a girl's feet being bound at age six to create the "ideal" image of feet. The girl's feet were bound to become 1/3 the original size, which crippled the woman, but also gave her a very high social status and was much admired. After the revolution of 1911, this practice of foot binding was ended. The idea of what is considered the "ideal" of beauty for women varies across different cultural ideals and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mo3shY_azw0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=evolution+of+the+feminine+beauty+ideal&amp;ots=Xt0gf13znd&amp;sig=mSwxpu4P7OktF5y8op7IC2mA1cE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title="The Feminine Ideal"|last=Thesander|first=Marianne|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=1997|isbn=1861890044|location=London|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple "ideals for women" in France as well as other various cultures. A more common ideal is for females to have the "three white things". These "things" or traits refer to skin, teeth, and hands. There are also the "three black things" including the color of the person's eyebrows and eyelashes. This leaves three other areas to embark on color including the cheeks, lips, and nails.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, L. l. (2016). GOLD, CRIMSON AND IVORY: THE IDEAL FEMALE BEAUTY AND ITS MATERIAL CULTURE IN 16TH CENTURY ITALY AND FRANCE. Acta Academiae Artium Vilnensis, (80/81), 35-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary perspectives==

Ideas of feminine beauty may have originated from features that correlate with fertility and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9938-z|title=Shape and Significance of Feminine Beauty: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=9–10|pages=723–731|year=2011|last1=Singh|first1=Devendra|last2=Singh|first2=Dorian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features include a figure where there is more fat distribution in the hip and thigh area, and vary between different cultures. Within Western cultures, having a smaller waist and bigger hips has a large influence. This differs in Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2093974|year=2007|author1=Singh|first1=D|title=Did the perils of abdominal obesity affect depiction of feminine beauty in the sixteenth to eighteenth century British literature?

{{Contract law}}

A '''firm offer''' is an [[Offer and acceptance|offer]] that will remain open for a certain period or until a certain time or occurrence of a certain event, during which it is incapable of being revoked. As a general rule, all offers are revocable at any time prior to acceptance, even those offers that purport to be irrevocable on their face.

In the [[United States]], an exception is the merchant firm offer rule set out in [[Uniform Commercial Code]] - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer to buy or sell goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-205 |title=Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205. Firm Offers|website=Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an offer is irrevocable even in the absence of [[consideration]]. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

However, even when the period of irrevocability expires, the offer may still remain open until revoked or rejected according to the general rules regarding termination of an offer.

If the offeree rejects, fails to accept the terms of the offer, fixed or otherwise, or makes a counter-offer, then the original offer is terminated.

{{primary|date=May 2015}}

'''General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns''' (or '''Principles'''), abbreviated '''GRASP''', consist of guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in [[object-oriented design]]. It is not related to the [[SOLID]] design principle.

The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are controller, creator, indirection, information expert, high [[cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]], low [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]], [[Polymorphism (object-oriented programming)|polymorphism]], protected variations, and pure fabrication. All these patterns answer some [[software]] problem, and these problems are common to almost every [[software development]] project. These techniques have not been invented to create new ways of working, but to better document and standardize old, tried-and-tested [[Computer programming|programming]] principles in object-oriented design. 

Computer scientist [[Craig Larman]] states that "the critical design tool for software development is a mind well educated in design principles. It is not [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or any other technology."{{sfn|Larman|2005|p = 272}} Thus, GRASP are really a mental toolset, a learning aid to help in the design of object-oriented software.

== Patterns ==
In OO design, a pattern is a named description of a problem and solution that can be applied to new contexts; ideally, a pattern advises us on how to apply its solution in varying circumstances and considers the forces and trade-offs. Many patterns, given a specific category of problem, guide the assignment of responsibilities to objects. 

=== Controller ===

The '''controller''' pattern assigns the responsibility of dealing with system events to a non-[[User Interface|UI]] class that represents the overall system or a [[use case]] scenario. A controller object is a non-user interface object responsible for receiving or handling a system event.

A use case controller should be used to deal with ''all'' system events of a use case, and may be used for more than one use case (for instance, for use cases ''Create User'' and ''Delete User'', one can have a single class called ''UserController'', instead of two separate use case controllers(This may save some space)).

The controller is defined as the first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates ("controls") a system operation. The controller should delegate the work that needs to be done to other objects; it coordinates or controls the activity. It should not do much work itself. The GRASP Controller can be thought of as being a part of the application/service layer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/domaindrivendesign/conversations/messages/7582
|title=Application Layer like business facade?
|work=Yahoo! Groups (domaindrivendesign)
|accessdate=15 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (assuming that the application has made an explicit distinction between the application/service layer and the [[domain layer]]) in an object-oriented system with common layers in an information system logical architecture.

===Creator===
{{see also|Factory pattern}}
Creation of objects is one of the most common activities in an object-oriented system. Which class is responsible for creating objects is a fundamental property of the relationship between objects of particular classes.
 
In general, a class &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; should be responsible for creating instances of class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; if one, or preferably more, of the following apply:
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; contain or compositely aggregate instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; record instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; closely use instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; have the initializing information for instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and pass it on creation.

===High cohesion===
{{main|Cohesion (computer science)}}
'''High cohesion''' is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and highly focused. Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities that increase the cohesive properties of a system. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. Elements with low cohesion often suffer from being hard to comprehend, hard to reuse, hard to maintain and averse to change.&lt;ref name="larman314"&gt;{{Harvnb|Larman|2005|pp=314&amp;ndash;315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information expert===
{{see also|Information hiding}}
'''Information expert''' (also '''expert''' or the '''expert principle''') is a principle used to determine where to delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities include methods, computed fields, and so on. 

Using the principle of information expert, a general approach to assigning responsibilities is to look at a given responsibility, determine the information needed to fulfill it, and then determine where that information is stored. 

Information expert will lead to placing the responsibility on the class with the most information required to fulfill it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larman|2005}} chapter 17, section 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low coupling===
{{main|Loose coupling}}
Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. '''Low coupling''' is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities to support
* lower dependency between the classes,
* change in one class having lower impact on other classes,
* higher reuse potential.

===Polymorphism===
{{main|Polymorphism in object-oriented programming}}
According to '''polymorphism''' principle, responsibility of defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens. This is achieved using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] operations. The user of the type should use polymorphic operations instead of explicit branching based on type.

===Protected variations===
{{see also|Open/closed principle}}
The '''protected variations''' pattern protects elements from the variations on other elements (objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] and using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] to create various implementations of this interface.

===Pure fabrication===
{{see also|Service (systems architecture)}}
A '''pure fabrication''' is a class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve low coupling, high cohesion, and the reuse potential thereof derived (when a solution presented by the ''information expert'' pattern does not). This kind of class is called a "service" in [[domain-driven design]].

===Indirection===
The indirection pattern supports low coupling and reuse potential between two elements by assigning the responsibility of mediation between them to an intermediate object. An example of this is the introduction of a controller component for mediation between data(model) and its representation(view) in the model-view control pattern.This ensures that coupling between them remains low.

'''Hazing''' ([[US English]]), '''initiation ceremonies'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[British English]]), '''[[:wikt:bastardisation|bastardisation]]''' ([[Australian English]]), '''[[ragging]]''' ([[South Asia]]), or '''[[Deposition (university)|deposition]]''', refers to the practice of  [[ritual]]s, challenges, and other activities involving [[harassment]], [[abuse]] or [[humiliation]] used as a way of [[initiation|initiating]] a person into a [[Social group|group]] including a new fraternity, sorority, team, or club.&lt;ref name="foley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Martin|title=Independent investigation report - Sexual Abuse at St. George's School and the School's Response: 1970 to 2015|url=http://www.foleyhoag.com/publications/ebooks-and-white-papers/2016/september/sexual-abuse-at-sgs|website=www.foleyhoag.com|publisher=Report of Independent Investigator Martin F. Murphy, Foley Hoag LLP|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazing is seen in many different  types of social groups, including [[gang]]s, [[Team sport|sports teams]], schools, [[military unit]]s, and [[fraternities and sororities]]. The initiation rites can range from relatively benign pranks, to protracted patterns of behavior that rise to the level of abuse or criminal misconduct.&lt;ref name="foley"/&gt; Hazing is often prohibited by law or prohibited by institutions such as colleges and universities because it may include either [[physical abuse|physical]] or [[psychological abuse]]. It may also include nudity or sexual assault.

== Terms ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
{{See also|Initiation|Rite of passage}}
In some  languages, terms with a religious theme or etymology are preferred, such as [[baptism]] or [[purgatory]] (e.g. {{lang|fr|[[w:fr:Baptême (folklore étudiant)|baptême]]}} in Belgian French, {{lang|nl|doop}} in Belgian Dutch) or variations on a theme of [[naïve]]té and the [[rite of passage]] such as a derivation from a term for freshman, for example {{lang|fr|[[w:fr:bizutage|bizutage]]}} in French French, {{lang|nl|ontgroening}} (de-[[wikt:greenhorn|green[horn]]]ing) in Netherlandic Dutch and Afrikaans (South Africa and Namibia), {{lang|es|novatada}} in Spanish, from {{lang|es|novato}}, meaning newcomer or rookie or a combination of both, such as in the [[Finland|Finnish]] {{lang|fi|mopokaste}} (literally "moped baptism", "moped" being the nickname for newcomers, stemming from the concept that they would be forced to drive a child's bicycle or tricycle). In [[Latvia]]n, the word {{lang|lv|iesvētības}}, which literally means "in-blessings", is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially [[confirmation]]. In [[Sweden|Swedish]], the term used is {{lang|se|nollning}}, literally "zeroing" (from the fact that when you start your first year, you're a "one'er", but before passing the rite you are a "zero"). In Portugal, the term {{lang|pt|[[praxe]]}}, which literally means "practice" or "habit", is used for initiation. In Brazil, it is called {{lang|pt|trote}} and is usually practiced at universities by older students ({{lang|pt|doutores}} and {{lang|pt|veteranos}}) against newcomers ({{lang|pt|calouros}}) in the first week of their first semester. In the [[Italy|Italian]] military, instead, the term used was {{lang|it|nonnismo}}, from {{lang|it|nonno}} (literally "grandfather"), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the [[Russian military]], where a hazing phenomenon known as {{lang|ru|дедовщи́на}} {{lang|ru-Latn|[[dedovshchina]]}} exists, meaning roughly "grandfather" or the slang term "gramps" (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of [[conscription]]). At education establishments in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, this practice involves existing students baiting new students and is called [[ragging]]. In Polish schools, hazing is known as {{lang|pl|kocenie}} (literally ''catting'', coming from the noun {{lang|pl|kot}} cat). It often features cat-related activities, like competitive milk drinking. Other popular tasks include measuring a long distance (i.e. hallways) with matches.

Often most or all of the endurance or the more serious ordeal is concentrated in a single session, which may be called ''[[hell]] night'', or prolonged to a ''hell week'', sometimes again at the pledge's{{huh|date=April 2017}} birthday (e.g. by [[birthday spanking]]), but some traditions keep terrorizing pledges over a long period, resembling [[fagging]].

In Israel, the practice is called {{lang|he|זובור}} {{lang|he-Latn|zubur}} (an Arabic-derived Hebrew slang word roughly equivalent to 'willie') and exists primarily in [[Israeli Defense Force]] combat units and the Israel Air Force. Unlike hazing in many other places, {{lang|he-Latn|zubur}} is typically used to mark the achievement of important milestones (in an ironic 'don't get too big for your britches' way), such as after a pilot's first solo flight.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Methods ==

Hazing activities can involve forms of ridicule and humiliation within the group or in public, while other hazing incidents are akin to pranks. A [[snipe hunt]] is such a prank, when a newcomer or credulous person is given an impossible task. Examples of snipe hunts include being sent to find a "dough repair kit" in a bakery,&lt;ref&gt;Aman, Reinhold (1996). ''Maledicta'', Volume 12. Maledicta Press. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the early 1900s rookies in the Canadian military were ordered to obtain a "brass magnet" when [[brass]] is not [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuEfAQAAMAAJ&amp;hl=en The Electrical Journal]''. Benn Bros. 1916. p. 51. Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanking is done mainly in the form of [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] among fraternities, sororities and similar clubs, sometimes over a lap, a knee, furniture or a pillow, but mostly with the victim "assuming the position", i.e., simply bending over forward.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} A variation of this (also as punishment) is [[trading licks]]. This practice is also used in the military.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Alternative modes (including bare-buttock paddling, strapping and switching, as well as mock forms of antiquated forms of [[physical punishment]]s such as [[stocks]], walking the plank and [[running the gauntlet]]) have been reported.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The hazee may be humiliated by being hosed or by sprinkler or buckets; covered with dirt or with (sometimes rotten) food, even urinated upon. Olive or [[Baby Oil|baby oil]] may be used to "show off" the bare skin, for wrestling or just slipperiness, e.g., to complicate pole climbing. Cleaning may be limited to a dive into water, hosing down or even paddling the worst off. They may have to do tedious cleaning including swabbing the decks or cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush. In fraternities, pledges often must clean up a mess intentionally made by brothers which can include fecal matter, urine, and dead animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giménez|first1=Mar|title=Descriptions|url=https://hazing.cornell.edu/cms/hazing/incidents/descriptions.cfm|website=Cornell University|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Servitude such as waiting on others (as at fraternity parties) or various other forms of housework, often with tests of obedience. In some cases, the hazee may be made to eat raw eggs, peppers, hot sauce, or drink too much alcohol. Some hazing even includes eating or drinking vile things such as bugs or rotting food.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
[[File:Catlin Okipa.jpg|thumb|Native American [[Mandan#Religion|okipa]] ceremony as witnessed by [[George Catlin]], circa 1835]]

The hazee may have to wear an imposed piece of clothing, outfit, item or something else worn by the victim in a way that would bring negative attention to the wearer. Examples include a uniform (e.g. [[toga]]); a leash or collar (also associated with [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]); infantile and other humiliating dress and attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rahman|first= Mohammed|work= SportsGrid|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/high-school-cheerleaders-hazing-ritual-includes-wearing-diapers-getting-hit-with-hot-dogs/|title=High School Cheerleaders' Hazing Ritual Includes Wearing Diapers, Getting Hit With Hot Dogs|date=27 May 2011|accessdate= 27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/july-dec12/hazing_09-21.html |title=For Perpetrators and Victims, Suppressing Temptation of College Hazing Rituals|newspaper=[[PBS]]|date= September 21, 2012|accessdate= 27 May 2013|first=Judy|last=Woodruff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markings may also be made on clothing or bare skin. They are painted, written, tattooed or shaved on, sometimes collectively forming a message (one letter, syllable or word on each pledge) or may receive [[tarring and feathering]] (or rather a mock version using some glue) or [[Human branding|branding]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Submission to senior members of the group is common. Abject "etiquette" required of pledges or subordinates may include prostration, kneeling, literal groveling, and kissing body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giménez|first1=Mar|title=Hidden harm|url=http://hazingprevention.org/home/hazing/hidden-harm/|website=Hazing Prevention|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other physical feats may be required, such as [[calisthenics]] and other physical tests, such as [[mud wrestling]], forming a [[human pyramid]], or climbing a greased pole. Exposure to the elements may be required, such as swimming or diving in cold water or snow.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Orientation tests may be held, such as abandoning pledges without transport. Dares include jumping from some height, stealing from police or rival teams and obedience.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  [[Blood wings|Blood pinning]] among military aviators (and many other elite groups) to celebrate becoming new pilots is done by piercing their chests with the sharp pins of aviator wings.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

On a pilot's [[first solo flight]], they are often drenched with water, as well as having the back of their shirt cut off to celebrate the achievement. Cutting off the back of the shirt originates from the days of tandem trainers, where the instructor sat behind the student and tugged on the back of their shirt in order to get their attention. Cutting off the back of the shirt symbolizes that the instructor has no need to do that anymore. &lt;ref&gt;Marchado, Rod, "First Solo Flight", Microsoft Flight Simulator X&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first ''[[crossing the equator]]'' in military and commercial navigation, each "pollywog" is subjected to a series of tests usually including running or crawling a gauntlet of abuse and various scenes supposedly situated at King Neptune's court. A ''pledge auction'' is a variation on the [[slave auction (BDSM)|slave auction]], where people bid on the paraded pledges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Hazing may also include subjecting the pledge to severe sleep deprivation until physical or mental impairment or hallucinations, including cardiac, digestive or excretory disturbances, are induced, and deliberate food poisonings unbeknownst to the pledge, sometimes through food outlets that are owned or franchised by members of the group, as well as public incidents, stunt accidents and vehicle collisions directed at the pledge by other persons using false identities who are unfamiliar to the pledge, and the practice of "The Silence", which is to [[gaslighting|gaslight]] the hazee, pretending not to know anything about the hazing or anything about the arguments being presented by the hazing, in order to force the pledge to doubt his or her sanity or self-worth. "The Silence" is exercised through covert means of infliction, at a distance, which makes it difficult for the victim to prove to law enforcement or to others. This method usually attempts to make everything that could go wrong, go wrong to the fault of the pledge, even when such errors are discreetly inflicted by the hazers. The hazers may deny the validity of the pledge's witness to events, discoveries, ideas and inventions, tangible reality, or falsify personal relationships.

When the hazers are associated with a larger organization, for instance, a major university that controls the local public hospitals, a pledge may encounter abusive behaviors or neglect when seeking needed medical help when the doctors or personnel are of the fraternity. This may also occur when the pledge seeks help from public employees who are also associated. This is done in order to isolate the pledge from their personal identity, their needs and others.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Hazings may occur in the home against nonconsenting, involuntary pledges when the family or cohabitants are already members of an organization or group that exercises hazing as a prerequisite for membership, even when "the pledge" has refused to join the group. The pledge may not have previously been informed of his or her cohabitant's association, particularly when such associations involve a covert organization. The hazers may attempt to inflict guilt on a sleep-deprived and beleaguered pledge "for providing a home", or they may fake "family emergencies or tragedies" against any prevailing medical needs of the pledge due to neglect and abuse.
In this instance, the subject may be branded as "pariah" or as an "outcast", in which case they are then subjected to neglect, abuse, violence, or methods such as "The Silence", and at risk of persecution if and when they speak of their hazing experiences to others outside of the group. This may be particularly true when the organization or group has violated civil rights, or the law. "The Silence" may include the hazers speaking in cryptic puns and double-entendre in order to either communicate their instructions to the pledge in a manner that they cannot be held accountable for, or to mislead the pledge. They may mislead the pledge due to a financial conflict of interest, for instance, a hazing by a family who is in charge of a guardian trust belonging to the pledge, or due to taking unlawful advantage of the pledge, their person or their property rights. This form of hazing may be unlawfully executed in order to force the pledge to release the hazers from their liabilities, as an act of extortion.

Hazing also occurs for apprentices in some trades. In printing, it consists of applying bronze blue to the apprentice's [[penis]] and [[testicles]], a color made by mixing black printers ink and dark blue printers ink, which takes a long time to wash off. Similarly, mechanics get their groins smeared with old dirty grease.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Hazing by women of their suitors, often assisted by the women's friends, can also play a role in budding romantic relationships, usually taking mental and psychological rather than physical forms, and apparently for the same basic purposes as other hazing.

== Psychology, sociology, purpose, and effects ==

Hazing supposedly serves a deliberate purpose of building [[solidarity]].  Psychologist [[Robert Cialdini]] uses the framework of consistency and commitment to explain the phenomenon of hazing and the vigor and zeal to which practitioners of hazing persist in and defend these activities even when they are made illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Cialdini|title=Influence: Science and Practice|edition= 4|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year= 2001|pages= 76–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRkxsDq8CgAC|isbn=9780321011473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cialdini cites a 1959 study in which the researchers observed that "persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Aronson.pdf |first=Elliott |last=Aronson |first2=Judson |last2=Mills |title=The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=177–181 |doi=10.1037/h0047195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1959 study shaped the development of [[cognitive dissonance]] theory by [[Leon Festinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Festinger |first=L. |year=1961 |title=The psychological effects of insufficient rewards |journal=American Psychologist |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1037/h0045112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists excel at understanding and explaining why certain group behaviors occur, especially when it comes to hazing; there are studies that better explain what actually happens psychologically and provide more insight into what happens within themselves. There are many different types of hazing. It can be seen in fraternities and sororities, sports teams, and other social clubs/organizations; within these organizations, there are psychological effects that both the hazer and hazee endure. In an article published by Raalte, Cornelius, Linder, and Brewer, they used team sports as a sample of their study. In the article, there seemed to be a more positive outlook of the idea of hazing. During the hazing process, there was a bond between the two parties (the hazer and the hazee) that grew and, in turn, created a more positive influence in the specific community&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c04784820dceba18dd09a1862c81c9d9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=30153|title=The Relationship Between Hazing and Team Cohesion - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;; naturally, people would do it more because it’s seen as positive People want to be accepted and sometimes, people will do anything to get it. Maybe someone is a social outcast and their only way to gain recognition is to join a certain club or organization. If they were to haze that person, it would show to himself and the others that his means to be accepted knows no bounds. If this person were not to join, they would probably be outed and/or ostracized from that community to many others which could lead to other psychological effects.Beyond a legal approach, eliminating or lessening the dangers of hazing requires an understanding and application of psychological and sociological factors. This is especially critical when many view hazing as an effective way to teach respect and develop discipline and loyalty within the group, and believe that hazing is a necessary component of initiation rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollmann|first= B. B. |year=2002|title=Hazing: Hidden campus crime|journal= New Directions for Student Services|pages= 11–24|doi= 10.1002/ss.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazing is a way of building conformity into a social group, something that can be seen in many sociological studies.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Moreover, initiation rituals when managed effectively can serve to build team cohesion and improve team performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt; while negative and detrimental forms of hazing alienate and disparage individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crow|first=Brian|last2=Macintosh|first2=Eric|date=2009|title=Conceptualizing a Meaningful Definition of Hazing in Sport|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16184740903331937|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|doi=10.1080/16184740903331937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissonance can produce feelings of group [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]] or [[social identity]] among initiates after the hazing experience because they want to justify the effort used. [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations or hazing rituals matter in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kamau |first=C. |year=2013 |title=What does being initiated severely into a group do?

In an article published by Linda Wilson, she and the National Pan-Hellenic Council Leaders at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University gave their perspectives and opinions on hazing at their institution, and she discussed why hazing is so hard to discontinue. The reason why is because the act of hazing is deeply rooted traditionally, so it becomes hard to break those traditional actions&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Richardon|date=2018|title=The National Pan-Hellenic Council Leaders' Perspectives on the Impact of Moral Thoughts and Actions on Hazing|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.xula.edu/docview/2050757832?accountid=40599|journal=DAI-A 79/10(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|pages=187|via=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, York College in Pennsylvania tried to solve this issue with suspending students who partake in the act. However, it's hard to dismantle not only because of tradition, but also because it's meant to be done in private spaces. It isn't meant to be public which makes getting rid of it even harder.

{{also|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}

According to one of the largest US National Surveys regarding hazing including over 60,000 student athletes from 2,400 colleges and universities:&lt;ref name=Alfred&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/sports_hazing/howmanystudents.cfm |publisher=Alfred University |title=National Survey of Sports Teams|accessdate= 27 May 2013|first=Nadine C.|last=Hoover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Over 325,000 athletes at more than 1,000 National Collegiate Athletic Association schools in the US participated in intercollegiate sports during 1998–99. Of these athletes:
*More than a quarter of a million experienced some form of hazing to join a college athletic team.
* One in five was subjected to unacceptable and potentially illegal hazing. They were kidnapped, beaten or tied up and abandoned. They were also forced to commit crimes&amp;nbsp;– destroying property, making prank phone calls or harassing others.
* Half were required to participate in drinking contests or alcohol-related hazing.
* Two in five consumed alcohol on recruitment visits even before enrolling.
* Two-thirds were subjected to humiliating hazing, such as being yelled or sworn at, forced to wear embarrassing clothing (if any clothing at all) or forced to deprive themselves of sleep, food or personal hygiene.
* One in five participated exclusively in positive initiations, such as team trips or ropes courses.}}

The survey found that 79% of college athletes experienced some form of hazing to join their team, yet 60% of the student-athletes respondents indicated that they would not report incidents of hazing.&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt;

A 2007 survey at American colleges found 55% of students in "clubs, teams, and organizations" experienced behavior the survey defined as hazing, including in varsity athletics and [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek-letter organizations]]. This survey found 47% of respondents experienced hazing before college, and in 25% of hazing cases, school staff were aware of the activity. 90% of students who experienced behavior the researchers defined as hazing did not consider themselves to have been hazed, and 95% of those who experienced what they themselves defined as hazing did not report it. The most common hazing-related activities reported in student groups included alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stophazing.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hazing_in_view_web1.pdf|title=Hazing in View: College Students at Risk Initial Findings from the National Study of Student Hazing|date=2008-03-11|accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chapters of fraternities and sororities have developed complex hazing rituals that range from demeaning tasks to embarrassing ceremonies. These practices are most common in, but not limited to, North American schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Other groups within university life that have hazing rituals include competition teams, fan clubs, social groups, secret societies and even certain [[service club]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} While hazing is less common in high schools, some secondary education institutions have developed hazing rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The armed forces have long had hazing rituals, which often involve violence and punishments. The United States military defines hazing as unnecessarily exposing a fellow soldier to an act which is cruel, abusive, oppressive, or harmful. In the modern western military, which combines discipline with welfare priorities, initiation practices can cause controversy. There is a tradition in many military&amp;nbsp;– especially elite&amp;nbsp;– corps of subjecting the newly trained ranks to a hell night-like "joining run", a macho preparation of men in the prime of their lives for the ordeals of warfare, going beyond what most civilians (and even many service personnel) would find acceptable; it usually combines humiliation (such as nudity) with physical endurance.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Police forces, especially those with a [[paramilitary]] tradition, or sub-units of police forces such as tactical teams, may also have hazing rituals. Rescue services, such as [[lifeguard]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/national/lifeguards-fired-for-hazing-new-squad-members/article_64593575-d16b-599b-80e6-f2caf8642c02.html|date=July 18, 1997|title=Lifeguards fired for hazing new squad members|publisher=The Journal Times|accessdate= 2013-06-03|location=Racine, WI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/-City-Probes-Nude-Lifeguard-Hazing-Incident-100481584.html|date=Aug 11, 2010|last=Page|first= Eric S.|title=City Probes Alleged Nude Lifeguard Hazing Incident|publisher=NBC San Diego|accessdate= 2013-06-03}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or air-sea rescue teams may have hazing rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the so-called 'traditional fraternities' have an introduction time which includes hazing rituals. The pledges go for a few days to a camp during which they undergo hazing rituals but are meanwhile introduced in the traditions of the fraternity. After camp, there are usually evenings or whole days in which the pledges have to be present at the fraternity, although slowly the pressure is released and the relations become somewhat more equal. Often, pledges collect or perform chores to raise funds for charity. At the end of the hazing period, the inauguration of the new members take place.

Incidents have occurred resulting in injuries and death. Often these incidents occur when members wish to join a house, (prestigious) sub-structure or commission for which they undergo a second (and usually heavier) hazing ritual. Incidents mostly occur during hazing rituals for these sub-structures, since there is less or no control from the fraternity board. Also, these sub-structure hazing rituals involve often excessive alcohol abuse, even when alcohol has become a taboo in hazing of the fraternity itself. Other situations causing additional risks for incidents are members (often joining the hazing camp but not designated with any responsibility) separating pledges and taking them away from the main group to 'amuse themselves' with them.

In 1965 a student at [[Utrecht University]] choked to death during a hazing ritual (''Roetkapaffaire''). There was public outrage when the perpetrators were convicted to light conditional sentences while left-wing [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] demonstrators were given unconditional prison sentences for order disturbances. The fact that the magistrates handling the case were all alumni of the same fraternity gave rise to accusions of nepotism and class justice. Two incidents in 1997, leading to one heavy injury and one death, lead to sharpened scrutiny over hazing. Hazing incidents have nevertheless occurred since, but justice is becoming keener in persecuting perpetrators.

The Netherlands has no anti-hazing legislation. Hazing incidents can be handled by internal resolution by the fraternity itself (the lightest cases), and via the criminal justice system as [[assault]] or in case of death [[negligent homicide]] or [[manslaughter]]. Universities as a rule support student unions (financially and by granting board members of such union a discount on the required number of ECTS credits) but can in the most extreme case suspend or withdraw recognition and support for such union.

===Philippines===
{{also|List of hazing deaths in the Philippines}}

According to R. Dayao, hazing, usually in initiation rites of fraternities, has a long history in the [[Philippines]], and has been a source of public controversy after many cases that resulted to death of the neophyte. The first recorded death due to hazing in the Philippines was recorded in 1954, with the death of Gonzalo Mariano Albert. Hazing was regulated under the [[Anti-Hazing Act of 1995]], after the death of Leonardo Villa in 1991, but many cases, usually causing severe injury or death, continued even after it was enacted, the latest involving [[Horacio Castillo III]], a College of Law student from the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

===Ragging in South Asia===
Ragging is a practice similar to hazing in educational institutions in South Asia. The word is mainly used in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Ragging involves existing students baiting or [[bullying]] new students. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to [[psychological torture|psychological]] or [[physical torture|physical]] torture.&lt;ref name=definition-ngo&gt;{{cite news

The practice of ritual abuse among social groups is not clearly understood. This is partly due to the secretive nature of the activities, especially within collegiate fraternities and sororities, and in part a result of long-term acceptance of hazing. Thus, it has been difficult for researchers to agree on the underlying social and psychological mechanisms that perpetuate hazing. In military circles hazing is sometimes assumed to test recruits under situations of stress and hostility. Although in no way a recreation of combat, hazing does put people into stressful situations that they are unable to control, which allegedly should weed out the weaker members prior to being put in situations where failure to perform will cost lives. A portion of the military training course known as [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) simulates as closely as is feasible the physical and psychological conditions of a [[POW]] camp.

The problem with this approach, according to opponents, is that the stress and hostility comes from ''inside'' the group, and not from ''outside'' as in actual combat situation, creating suspicion and distrust towards the superiors and comrades-in-arms. Willing participants may be motivated by a desire to prove to senior soldiers their stability in future combat situations, making the unit more secure, but blatantly brutal hazing can in fact produce negative results, making the units more prone to break, desert or mutiny than those without hazing traditions, as observed in the Russian army in [[Chechnya]], where units with the strongest traditions of [[dedovschina]] were the first to break and desert under enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Sean |last=Renaud| title=A View from Chechnya: An Assessment of Russian Counterinsurgency During the two Chechen Wars and Future Implications | page=78|url=http://muir.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1804/02_whole.pdf|year=2010|publisher= Massey University|location=Palmerston North, NZ|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; At worst, hazing may lead into [[fragging]] incidents. Colleges and universities sometimes avoid publicizing hazing incidents for fear of damaging institutional reputations or incurring financial liability to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sweet |first=Stephen|title= College and Society: An Introduction to Sociological Imagination|year= 2001|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|pages=19–37|isbn=978-0205305568|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/College_and_society.html?id=840lAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 study, a survey of 3,293 collegiate athletes, coaches, athletic directors and deans found a variety of approaches to prevent hazing, including strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases, implementation of athletic, behavioral, and academic standards guiding recruitment; provisions for alternative bonding and recognition events for teams to prevent hazing; and law enforcement involvement in monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting hazing incidents.&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt; Hoover's research suggested half of all college athletes are involved in alcohol-related hazing incidents, while one in five are involved in potentially illegal hazing incidents. Only another one in five was involved in what Hoover described as positive initiation events, such as taking team trips or running obstacle courses.

Hoover wrote: "Athletes most at risk for any kind of hazing for college sports were men; non-Greek members; and either swimmers, divers, soccer players, or lacrosse players. The campuses where hazing was most likely to occur were primarily in eastern or southern states with no anti-hazing laws. The campuses were rural, residential, and had Greek systems."&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt; (Hoover uses the term "Greek" to refer to U.S.-style fraternities and sororities.) Hoover found that non-fraternity members were most at risk of hazing, and that football players are most at risk of potentially dangerous or illegal hazing.&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt; In the May issue of the ''American Journal of Emergency Medicine'', Michelle Finkel reported that hazing injuries are often not recognized for their true cause in emergency medical centers. The doctor said hazing victims sometimes hide the real cause of injuries out of shame or to protect those who caused the harm. In protecting their abusers, hazing victims can be compared with victims of domestic violence, Finkel wrote.&lt;ref name=AJEM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finkel|first= Michelle A., MD|url=http://njbullying.org/documents/hazing-EDarticleFinkel2002.pdf|format=PDF|title=Traumatic Injuries Caused By Hazing Practices|journal=American Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume= 20|number= 3 |date=May 2002|accessdate= 27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkel cites hazing incidents including "beating or kicking to the point of [[Physical trauma|traumatic injury]] or death, burning or [[branding persons|branding]], excessive [[calisthenics]], being forced to eat unpleasant substances, and psychological or sexual abuse of both males and females". Reported coerced sexual activity is sometimes considered "horseplay" rather than rape, she wrote.&lt;ref name=AJEM/&gt; Finkel quoted from Hank Nuwer's book "Wrongs of Passage" which counted 56 hazing deaths between 1970 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHM9ltEQIU0C|title=Wrongs of Passage|first=Hank|last= Nuwer|publisher=Indiana University Press|year= 2001|isbn=9780253214980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, controversy arose over a video showing [[Royal Marines]] fighting naked and intoxicated as part of a hazing ritual. The fight culminated with one soldier receiving a kick to the face, rendering him unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504191/Police-investigate-video-of-beaten-marine.html|title=Police investigate video of beaten marine|accessdate=2009-01-30

Under further investigation, the Marines had just returned from a six-month tour of Iraq, and were in their "cooling down" period, in which they spend two weeks at a naval base before they are allowed back into society. The man who suffered the kick to the head did not press charges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2008, a national hazing study was conducted by Dr Elizabeth Allan and Dr Mary Madden from the University of Maine. This investigation is the most comprehensive study of hazing to date and includes survey responses from more than 11,000 undergraduate students at 53 colleges and universities in different regions of the U.S. and interviews with more than 300 students and staff at 18 of these campuses. Through the vision and efforts of many, this study fills a major gap in the research and extends the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding about hazing. Ten initial findings are described in the report, Hazing in View: College Students at Risk. These include:

{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States|Ragging in India|Ragging in Sri Lanka#Major incidents|List of hazing deaths in the Philippines}}With hazing, there have been countless instances where it has been taken too far and has resulted in death or near death experiences. Sometimes people who haze others are too indulged in the act of doing it that they’re not attentive to possible harm to the other person.

*'''1495''': [[Leipzig University]] banned the hazing of [[freshmen]] by other students: "Statute Forbidding Any One to Annoy or Unduly Injure the Freshmen. Each and every one attached to this university is forbidden to offend with insult, torment, harass, drench with water or urine, throw on or defile with dust or any filth, mock by whistling, cry at them with a terrifying voice, or dare to molest in any way whatsoever physically or severely, any, who are called freshmen, in the market, streets, courts, colleges and living houses, or any place whatsoever, and particularly in the present college, when they have entered in order to matriculate or are leaving after matriculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askthepast.blogspot.com/2013/08/how-to-treat-freshmen-1495.html|title=Ask the Past: How to Treat the Freshmen [sic], 1495|work=Ask the Past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1900''': Oscar Booz began at West Point in June 1898 in good physical health. Four months later, he resigned due to health problems. He died in December 1900 of [[tuberculosis]]. During his long struggle with the illness, he blamed the illness on hazing he received at West Point in 1898, claiming he had hot sauce poured down his throat on three occasions as well as a number of other grueling hazing practices, such as brutal beatings and having hot wax poured on him in the night. His family claimed that scarring from the hot sauce made him more susceptible to the infection, causing his death. Among other things, Booz claimed that his devotion to Christianity made him a target and that he was tormented for reading his Bible.&lt;ref name="San Francisco"&gt;{{cite news|title=Father of the victim testifies that his wrote it was hard to be a Christian at West Point|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19001218.2.12#|agency=San Francisco Call|date=December 18, 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of hazing at West Point entered the national spotlight following his death.

*'''1903''': Three young boys, aged 11, 10, and 7, read about hazing practices in college and decided to try it themselves. They built a fire in a pasture behind the schoolhouse and led 9-year-old Ralph Canning to the spot. They heated a number of stones until they were red hot. The boys forced Canning to both sit and stand on the hot stones and held him there despite his screams. The boys then either walked or jumped on him (depending on the source). He was finally allowed to leave and he crawled home, where he died two weeks later.

They are also symbolic systems, ways of ordering reality, thereby rendering experience of time and space meaningful".&lt;ref&gt;Friedland, Roger, and Robert R. Alford.  1991.  Bringing Society Back in: Symbols, Practices, and Institutional Contradictions.  Pp. 232-266 in The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis, edited by Walter W. Powell and Paul J. DiMaggio. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton and Ocasio (1999: 804) define institutional logics as "the socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which individuals produce and reproduce their material subsistence, organize time and space, and provide meaning to their social reality".&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Patricia, H. and William Ocasio (2008). “Institutional Logics,” in Royston Greenwood, Christine Oliver, Kerstin Sahlin and Roy Suddaby (eds.) Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Focusing on macro-[[societal]] phenomena, Friedland and Alford (1991: 232) identified several key Institutions: the [[Capitalist]] market, [[bureaucratic]] state, [[democracy]], [[nuclear family]], and [[Christianity]] that are each guided by a distinct institutional logic. Thornton (2004) revised Friedland and Alford’s (1991) inter-institutional scheme to six institutional orders, i.e., the market, the corporation, the professions, the state, the family, and religions. More recently, Thornton, Ocasio and Lounsbury (2012), in more fully fleshing out the institutional logic perspective, added community as another key institutional order. This revision to a theoretically abstract and analytically distinct set of ideal types makes it useful for studying multiple logics in conflict and consensus, the hybridization of logics, and institutions in other parts of society and the world. While building on Friedland and Alford’s scheme, the revision addresses the confusion created by conflating institutional sectors with ideology (democracy) and means of organization (bureaucracy), variables that can be characteristic several different institutional sectors. The institutional logic of Christianity leaves out other religions in the US and other religions that are dominant in other parts of the world. Thornton and Ocasio (2008) discuss the importance of not confusing the ideal types of the inter-institutional system with a description of the empirical observations in a study—that is to use the ideal types as meta theory and method of analysis.

== New institutionalism ==
[[Organizational theorist]]s operating within the [[new institutionalism]] (see also [[institutional theory]]) have begun to develop the institutional logics concept by empirically testing it. One variant emphasizes how logics can focus the attention of key decision-makers on a particular set of issues and solutions (Ocasio, 1997), leading to logic-consistent decisions (Thornton, 2002).  A fair amount of research on logics has focused on the importance of dominant logics and shifts from one logic to another (e.g., Lounsbury, 2002; Thornton, 2002; Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005).  Haveman and Rao (1997) showed how the rise of Progressive thought enabled a shift in savings and loan organizational forms in the U.S. in the early 20th century.  Scott et al. (2000) detailed how logic shifts in healthcare led to the valorization of different actors, behaviors and governance structures.  Thornton and Ocasio (1999) analyzed how a change from professional to market logics in U.S. higher education publishing led to corollary changes in how executive succession was carried out.

While much earlier work focused on ambiguity as a result of multiple and conflicting institutional logics, at the levels of analysis of society and individual roles,&lt;ref&gt;(Boltanski and Thevenot ([1986] 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Friedland and Alford (1991:248-255) discussed in theory multiple and competing logics at the macro level of analysis. Recent empirical research, inspired by the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], is developing a more pluralistic approach by focusing on multiple competing logics and contestation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;(Lounsbury, 2007; Marquis &amp; Lounsbury, 2007; Schneiberg, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  By focusing on how some fields are composed of multiple logics, and thus, multiple forms of institutionally-based rationality, institutional analysts can provide new insight into practice variation and the dynamics of practice.&lt;ref&gt;(see Lounsbury, 2001; Lounsbury &amp; Crumley, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple logics can create diversity in practice by enabling variety in cognitive orientation and contestation over which practices are appropriate.  As a result, such multiplicity can create enormous ambiguity, leading to logic blending, the creation of new logics, and the continued emergence of new practice variants.  Thornton, Jones, and Kury (2005) showed how competing logics may never resolve but share the market space as in the case of architectural services.

Recent research has also documented the co-existence or potential conflict of multiple logics within particular organizations. Zilber (2002), for example, described the organizational consequences of a shift from one logic to another within an Israeli rape crisis center, in which new organization members reshaped the center and its practices to reflect a new dominant logic that they have carried into the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, T. B. (2002). "Institutionalization as an Interplay between Actions, Meanings, and Actors: The Case of a Rape Crisis Center in Israel." Academy of Management Journal, 45(1), 234-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilcsik (2010) documented a logic shift in a post-Communist government agency, describing a conflict between the agency's old guard (carriers of the logic of Communist state bureaucracies) and its new guard (carriers of a market logic). This study shows that, paradoxically, an intra-organizational group's efforts to resist a particular logic might in fact open the organization's door to carriers of that very logic.&lt;ref&gt;Tilcsik, A. (2010). "From ritual to reality: Demography, ideology, and decoupling in a post-communist government agency." Academy of Management Journal, 53(6), 1474-1498. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1494035 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Almandoz (2012) examined the embeddedness of new local banks' founding teams in a community logic or a financial logic, linking institutional logics to new banking venture's establishment and entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;Almandoz, J. (2012). "Arriving at the Starting Line: The Impact of Community and Financial Logics on New Banking Ventures." Academy of Management Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; As these studies demonstrate, the institutional logics perspective offers valuable insights into important intra-organizational processes affecting organizational practices, change, and success. These studies represent an effort to understand institutional complexity due to conflicting or inconsistent logics within particular organizations, a situation that might results from the entry of new organization members or the layering (or "sedimentation") of new organizational imprints upon old ones over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2013-06-01|title=Imprinting: Toward a Multilevel Theory|url=http://annals.aom.org/content/7/1/195|journal=Academy of Management Annals|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=195–245|doi=10.1080/19416520.2013.766076|issn=1941-6520|citeseerx=10.1.1.728.6149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3215">In [[probability theory]], an '''interacting particle system''' ('''IPS''') is a [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt; (X(t))_{t \in \mathbb R^+} &lt;/math&gt; on some configuration space &lt;math&gt; \Omega= S^G &lt;/math&gt; given by a site space, a [[Countable infinite|countable-infinite]] [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; and a local state space, a [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;. More precisely IPS are continuous-time [[Markov process|Markov jump processes]] describing the collective behavior of stochastically interacting components. IPS are the continuous-time analogue of [[stochastic cellular automata]].
Among the main examples are the [[voter model]], the [[contact process (mathematics)|contact process]], the [[asymmetric simple exclusion process]] (ASEP), the [[Glauber dynamics]] and in particular the stochastic [[Ising model]].

IPS are usually defined via their [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|Markov generator]] giving rise to a unique [[Markov process]] using Markov [[semigroups]] and the [[Hille-Yosida theorem]]. The generator again is given via so-called transition rates &lt;math&gt;c_\Lambda(\eta,\xi)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of sites and &lt;math&gt;\eta,\xi\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\eta_i=\xi_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i\notin\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The rates describe exponential waiting times of the process to jump from configuration &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; into configuration &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. More generally the transition rates are given in form of a finite measure &lt;math&gt;c_\Lambda(\eta,d\xi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S^\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

The generator &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of an IPS has the following form. First, the domain of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the space of "observables", that is, the set of real valued [[continuous functions]] on the configuration space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any observable &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in the domain of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, one has

&lt;math&gt;Lf(\eta)=\sum_\Lambda\int_{\xi:\xi_{\Lambda^c}=\eta_{\Lambda^c}}c_\Lambda(\eta,d\xi)[f(\xi)-f(\eta)]&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, for the stochastic [[Ising model]] we have &lt;math&gt;G=\mathbb Z^d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S=\{-1,+1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\neq\{i\}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i\in G&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;c_i(\eta,\eta^i)=\exp[-\beta\sum_{j:|j-i|=1}\eta_i\eta_j]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta^i&lt;/math&gt; is the configuration equal to &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; except it is flipped at site &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a new parameter modeling the inverse temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12977">In mathematics, '''Kostant's convexity theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Bertram|last=Kostant|year=1973|authorlink=Bertram Kostant}},  states that the projection of every [[coadjoint orbit]] of a connected [[compact Lie group]] into the dual of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] is a [[convex set]]. It is a special case of a more general result for [[symmetric space]]s. Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of {{harvtxt|Schur|1923}}, {{harvtxt|Horn|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Thompson|1972}} for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all ''n'' by ''n'' complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ.

Kostant used this to generalize the [[Golden–Thompson inequality]] to all compact groups.

==Compact Lie groups==
Let ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with [[maximal torus]] ''T'' and [[Weyl group]] ''W'' = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/''T''. Let their Lie algebras be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''P'' be the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; for some Ad-invariant inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the Weyl group.

==Symmetric spaces==
Let ''G'' be a compact Lie group and σ an involution with ''K'' a compact subgroup fixed by σ and containing the [[identity component]] of the fixed point subgroup of σ. Thus ''G''/''K'' is a [[symmetric space]] of compact type. Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; be their Lie algebras and let σ also denote the corresponding involution of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; be the −1 eigenspace of σ and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal Abelian subspace. Let ''Q'' be the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; for some Ad(''K'')-invariant inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, ''Q''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices the ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the [[restricted Weyl group]] (the normalizer of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in ''K'' modulo its centralizer).

The case of a compact Lie group is the special case where ''G'' = ''K'' × ''K'', ''K'' is embedded diagonally and σ is the automorphism of ''G'' interchanging the two factors.

==Proof for a compact Lie group==
Kostant's proof for symmetric spaces is given in {{harvtxt|Helgason|1984}}. There is an elementary proof just for compact Lie groups using similar ideas, due to {{harvtxt|Wildberger|1993}}: it is based on a generalization of the [[Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm]] to compact Lie groups.

Let ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. For each positive root α there is a homomorphism of SU(2) into ''K''. A simple calculation with 2 by 2 matrices shows that if  ''Y'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''k'' varies in this image of SU(2), then ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') traces a straight line between ''P''(''Y'') and its reflection in the root α.  In particular the component in the α root space—its "α off-diagonal coordinate"—can be sent to 0. In performing this latter operation, the distance from ''P''(''Y'') to ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') is bounded above by size of the α off-diagonal coordinate of ''Y''. Let ''m'' be the number of positive roots, half the dimension of ''K''/''T''. Starting from an arbitrary ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; take the largest off-diagonal coordinate and send it to zero to get ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Continue in this way, to get a sequence (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P^\perp(Y_{n+1})\|^2\le \left({m-1\over m}\right)\|P^\perp(Y_n)\|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to 0 and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P(Y_{n+1}-Y_n)\|\le \|P^\perp(Y_n)\|.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence, so  tends to ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊕ ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''X''. On the other hand, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lies on the line segment joining ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and its reflection in the root α. Thus ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in the Weyl group polytope defined by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. These convex polytopes are thus increasing as ''n'' increases and hence ''P''(''Y'') lies in the polytope for ''X''. This can be repeated for each ''Z'' in the ''K''-orbit of ''X''. The limit is necessarily in the Weyl group orbit of ''X'' and hence ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is contained in the convex polytope defined by ''W''(''X'').

To prove the opposite inclusion, take ''X'' to be a point in the positive Weyl chamber. Then all the other points ''Y'' in the convex hull of ''W''(''X'') can be obtained by a series of paths in that intersection moving along the negative of a simple root. (This matches a familiar picture from representation theory: if by duality ''X'' corresponds to a dominant weight λ, the other weights in the Weyl group polytope defined by λ are those appearing in the irreducible representation of ''K'' with highest weight λ. An argument with lowering operators shows that each such weight is linked by a chain to λ obtained by successively subtracting simple roots from λ.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1997}}
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) Each part of the path from ''X'' to ''Y'' can be obtained by the process described above for the copies of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, so the whole convex polytope lies in ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'').

==Other proofs==
{{harvtxt|Heckman|1982}} gave another proof of the convexity theorem for compact Lie groups, also presented in {{harvtxt|Hilgert|Hofmann|Lawson|1989}}. For compact groups, {{harvtxt|Atiyah|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Guillemin|Sternberg|1982}} showed that if ''M'' is a [[symplectic manifold]] with a Hamiltonian action of a torus ''T'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, then the image of the [[moment map]]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{t}^*}&lt;/math&gt;

is a convex polytope with vertices in the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' (the image is a finite set). Taking for ''M'' a coadjoint orbit of ''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the moment map for ''T'' is the composition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{k}^*\rightarrow \mathfrak{t}^*.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Ad-invariant inner product to identify &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the map becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(K)\cdot X \rightarrow \mathfrak{t},}&lt;/math&gt;

the restriction of the orthogonal projection. Taking ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, the fixed points of ''T'' in the orbit Ad(''K'')⋅''X'' are just the orbit under the Weyl group, ''W''(''X''). So the convexity properties of the moment map imply that the image is the convex polytope with these vertices. {{harvtxt|Ziegler|1992}} gave a simplified direct version of the proof using moment maps.

{{harvtxt|Duistermaat|1983}} showed that a generalization of the convexity properties of the moment map could be used to treat the more general case of symmetric spaces. Let τ be a smooth involution of ''M'' which takes the symplectic form ω to −ω and such that ''t'' ∘ τ = τ ∘ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''M'' and the fixed point set of τ (assumed to be non-empty) have the same image under the moment map. To apply this, let ''T'' = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, a torus in ''G''. If ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; as before the moment map yields the projection map

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(G)\cdot X \rightarrow \mathfrak{a}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Let τ be the map τ(''Y'') =  − σ(''Y''). The map above has the same image as that of the fixed point set of τ, i.e. Ad(''K'')⋅''X''. Its image is the convex polytope with vertices the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' on Ad(''G'')⋅''X'', i.e. the points ''w''(''X'') for ''w'' in ''W'' = N&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/C&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'').

==Further directions==
In {{harvtxt|Kostant|1973}} the convexity theorem is deduced from a more general convexity theorem concerning the projection onto the  component ''A'' in the [[Iwasawa decomposition]] ''G'' = ''KAN'' of a real semisimple Lie group ''G''. The result discussed above for compact Lie groups  ''K'' corresponds to the special case when ''G'' is the [[complexification]] of ''K'': in this case the Lie algebra of ''A'' can be identified with &lt;math&gt; i \mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The more general version of Kostant's theorem has also been generalized to semisimple symmetric spaces by {{harvtxt|van den Ban|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Kac|Peterson|1984}} gave a generalization for infinite-dimensional groups.

'''Kowtow''', which is borrowed from ''kau tau'' in Cantonese (''koutou'' in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by [[prostration]], that is, [[kneeling]] and bowing so low as to have one's head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' (叩) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' (磕) has the general meaning of "touch upon (a surface)", ''tou'' (頭) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], or the [[Warring States Period]] of China's history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 206 BC).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In [[East Asia|East Asian]] culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has become reduced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Traditional usage==
In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the "three kneelings and nine kowtows", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the "full kowtow" as "three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]
As government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.

Since one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.

[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Theistic%20and%20Non-theistic%20Belief.pdf "Theistic and Non-theistic Belief in China"]. Joseph A. Adler Kenyon College Public Lecture at John Carroll University March 29, 2012. Retrieved 24 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;!-- A citation from the analects or another reliable source would be helpful--&gt; Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.

==Modern Chinese usage==

The kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.

The kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.

==Religion==
{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}
Prostration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either "worship with the crown (of the head)" (頂禮 ding li) or "casting the five limbs to the earth" (五體投地 wuti tou di)—referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows—stand up and kneel down again between each set—as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term ''three kneelings and nine head knockings'' ({{lang|zh-hant|三跪九叩}}). Also, some Buddhist [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the [[Triple Gem]] of Buddhism, the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.

==Diplomacy==
The word "kowtow" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from  the physical act and the East Asian context.

The kowtow was a significant issue for diplomats, since it was required to come into the presence of the [[Emperor of China]], but it meant submission before him. The British embassies of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney]] (1793) and [[William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst]] (1816) were allegedly unsuccessful, partly because kowtowing would mean acknowledging their King as a subject of the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]].

Dutch ambassador [[Isaac Titsingh]] did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794–1795 mission to the imperial court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus. (1798). [http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B2962471X/ ''An authentic account of the embassy of the Dutch East-India company, to the court of the emperor of China, in the years 1794 and 1795''], Vol. I (English edition). pp. 285 in original (p. 335 of pp. 339 in digitized format).&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Titsingh mission, including [[Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest]] and [[Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes]], made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.

On two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler – specifically the Russian Tsar. T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina [[Anna of Russia|Anna]], as per instructions by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg. &lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Immunel C.-Y. (1999), ''The Rise of Modern China'', New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 115–118 &lt;/ref&gt; Hsu notes that [[Kanghsi Emperor]], Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.  

The kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896 when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:仁祖 34卷, 15年 (1636) 正月30日 |publisher=[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]|language=Chinese|quote=龍胡入報, 出傳汗言曰: “前日之事, 欲言則長矣。 今能勇決而來, 深用喜幸。” 上答曰: “天恩罔極。” 龍胡等引入, 設席於壇下北面, 請上就席, 使淸人臚唱。 上行'''三拜九叩頭禮'''。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground ({{lang|zh|三拜九叩頭禮}}), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/personal/tsuruta/sei0005.htm|title=重点領域研究「沖縄の歴史情報研究 (History Study of Okinawa)|quote= – 「通航一覧・琉球国部 正編 巻之二十三　琉球国部二十三、唐国往来」"|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9047">A '''moral entrepreneur''' is an individual, group or formal organization that seeks to influence a group to adopt or maintain a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]. Moral entrepreneurs are those who take the lead in labeling a particular behaviour and spreading or popularizing this label throughout society. This can include attributing negative labels to behaviour as well as the removal of negative labels, positively labeling, or removing positive labels. The moral entrepreneur may press for the creation or enforcement of a norm for any number of reasons, altruistic or selfish. Such individuals or groups also hold the power to generate [[moral panic]]; similarly multiple moral entrepreneurs may have conflicting goals and work to counteract each other. Some examples of moral entrepreneurs are: [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving|MADD (mothers against drunk driving)]], the [[anti-tobacco]] lobby, the [[gun control]] lobby, anti-pornography groups, [[LGBT social movements]], and the [[Opposition to legalized abortion|pro-life]] and [[Support for the legalization of abortion|pro-choice]] movements (an example of two moral entrepreneurs working against each other on a single issue).

== Rule creator and rule enforcer==
The term "moral entrepreneur" was coined by [[Howard S. Becker]]. In his view, moral entrepreneurs fall into roughly two categories: ''rule creators'', and ''rule enforcers''. 

Rule creators generally express the conviction that some kind of threatening social evil exists that must be combated. They can be seen as moral crusaders, who are concerned chiefly with the successful persuasion of others, but are not concerned with the means by which this persuasion is achieved. Successful moral crusades are generally dominated by those in the upper social strata of society (Becker, 1963). They often include religious groups, lawmaking bodies, and stakeholders in a given field. There is political competition in which these moral crusaders originate crusades aimed at generating reform, based on what they think is moral, therefore defining deviance. Moral crusaders must have power, public support, generate public awareness of the issue, and be able to propose a clear and acceptable solution to the problem (Becker, 1963). The degree of a moral entrepreneur's power is highly dependent upon the social and cultural context (Reinarman, 1994). Social position determines one's ability to define and construct reality; therefore, the higher one's social position, the greater his or her moral value.

After a time, crusaders become dependent upon experts or professionals, who serve to legitimize a moral creed on technical or scientific grounds. Rule enforcers, such as policemen, are compelled by two drives: the need to justify their own role, and the need to win respect in interactions. They are in a bind; if they show too much effectiveness one might say they are not needed, and if they show too little effectiveness one might say they are failing. Rule enforcers just feel the need to enforce the rule because that is their job; they are not really concerned with the content of the rule. As rules are changed, something that was once acceptable may now be punished and vice versa. Such officials tend to take a pessimistic view of [[human nature]] because of constant exposure to willful deviance.

The sociology of [[social control]] seeks to predict and explain the behavior of both rule creators and rule enforcers. The creation and application of explicit rules are seen as characteristics of moralism, or the tendency to treat people as enemies. Among the social conditions that are identified as sources of moralism are status superiority and social remoteness between the agents of social control and the people whose behavior they regulate. Thus, the most likely targets of both rule creators and rule enforcers are those who are socially inferior, culturally different, and personally unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald. "Making Enemies." Pp. 144-57 in The Social Structure of Right and Wrong. San Diego, CA: Academic Press. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It is their behavior that is most likely to seem objectionable and to call forth the strenuous efforts of moral entrepreneurs. Once moral entrepreneurs or claimsmakers define the behaviors of these individuals or groups as deviant or a moral threat, then the entire group may be seen by society as a [[deviant subculture]]. Similarly, they or their behavior may be seen as the roots of the next moral panic. This is often the goal of the moral entrepreneurs; to rally the support of society behind their specific aims through the redefining of behaviors and groups as deviant or problematic. Alternately, those individuals with social power, wealth, high status, or large public support bases are the most likely to assert this power and to act as a moral entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggle, Justin and Holmes, Malcolm. "Blowing Smoke: Status Politics and the Smoking Ban". 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social problems ==
[[Social issue|Social problems]] are born largely from socially constructed campaigns by moral entrepreneurs. In the [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] approach to social problems (including [[labeling theory]]), social policy is not seen as the implementation of a shared consensus about what is best. Rather the society is viewed as consisting of a plurality of understandings of what is best. In order for social policy to arise, some individual or group has to initiate a social movement whose task is to articulate a definition of a social problem such that a desired social policy is consistent with this definition of the problem. These individuals or groups are referred to as moral entrepreneurs. 

Moral entrepreneurs are critical for moral emergence because they call attention to issues or even 'create' issues by using language that names, interprets, and dramatizes them.&lt;ref&gt;Finnemore and Sikkink. International Norm Dynamics and Political Change. in "International Organization." 52 (autumn): Pp. 887-917. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typifying]] is a prominent rhetorical tool employed by moral entrepreneurs when attempting to define social problems. Typification is when claimsmakers characterize a problem's nature which is most commonly done by suggesting that a problem is best understood from a particular perspective (i.e. medical, moral, criminal, political, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Best, Joel. "typification and Social Problems Construction." Pp. 3-10 in Images of Issues: Typifying Contemporary Social Problems. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, moral entrepreneurs often engage in typification by claiming that certain behaviors or groups are acting in morally dangerous ways. Moral entrepreneurs are more successful at defining deviance when they can identify an entire group with a particular behavior and create fear that the behavior represents a danger not only to the group but also to the rest of society. Through typification and the creation of a dangerous class, moral entrepreneurs aim to place the activities of a particular group on the public's agenda and label certain actions as social problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Anne L., and Helen M. Ingram. Deserving and Entitled: Social Constructions and Public Policy. Albany: State University of New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimsmakers in areas such as the problem of drinking and driving, child abuse, or date rape play an important role in the creation of the rhetoric that creates and determines what is deviant and what is a considered a problem in society.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Nathan. "How Social Problems are Born". 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Through creating and popularizing definitions for terms relevant to the issue (such as "rape", "abuse" and "drunk"), claimsmakers and moral entrepreneurs can not only further their interests, but also sway the social movement and understanding of the issues themselves.

== Lawmaking ==

Moral entrepreneurs are also central in the construction of social deviance, including the development of drug scares. The role of moral entrepreneurs in this instance, for example, is to assign responsibility to drugs for an array of preexisting public problems. (The Social Construction of Drug Scares, Reinarman). Over the course of the past century, drug laws have been passed with the intent of reducing drug problems; even if they have not done this, they have certainly expanded the power of the social control held by moral entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Reinarman, Craig. "The Social Construction of Drug Scares". 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of laws created by moral entrepreneurs are: [[Prohibition in the United States]] 1919, San Francisco's anti-opium den ordinance of 1875, and the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">A '''Morton's fork''' is a type of [[false dilemma]] in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion. It is said to have originated with the collecting of taxes by [[John Morton (bishop)|John Morton]].

The earliest known use of the term dates from the mid-19th century and the only known earlier mention is a claim by [[Francis Bacon]] of an extant tradition.&lt;ref name="ODPF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O214-MortonsFork.html |title=Morton's Fork |work=Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemma==
Under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] John Morton was made archbishop of Canterbury in 1486, then Lord Chancellor in 1487. He raised taxation funds for his king by holding that someone living modestly must be saving money and, therefore, could afford taxes, whereas someone living extravagantly obviously was rich and, therefore, could afford taxes.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Morton's-Fork | title=Morton's Fork | publisher=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODPF"/&gt;

In some instances, such as Morton's original use of the fallacy, it may be that one of the two observations is probably valid, but the other is pure [[Sophism | sophistry]]: evidence of possessing wealth may be genuinely irrelevant to having a source of taxable income.

In other cases, it may be that neither observation may be relied upon to support the conclusion properly. For example, asserting that a person suspected of a crime who is acting nervously must have something to feel guilty about, while a person who acts calmly and confidently must be practised or skilled at hiding guilt. Either observation therefore has little, if any, [[relevance (law)|probative]] value, as each could equally be evidence for the opposite conclusion.

==Examples==
"[[Morton's fork coup]]" is a maneuver in the game of [[Contract bridge|bridge]] that uses the principle of Morton's Fork.&lt;ref&gt;Frey et al. (1976). ''The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge'', p. 295. {{ISBN|0-517-52724-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Robert. [[The Bridge World]], March 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of the television series ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' is entitled "[[Morton's Fork (Fargo)|Morton's Fork]]", after the dilemma. It is also mentioned in NCIS Los Angeles season 5 episode 16, "Fish Out of Water."

'''Netocracy''' was a term invented by the editorial board of the American technology magazine [[Wired magazine|''Wired'']] in the early 1990s. A [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Internet]]'' and ''[[aristocracy]]'', ''netocracy'' refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a [[bourgeoisie]] of a gradually diminishing importance.

The concept was later picked up and redefined by the Swedish philosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] for their book ''Netocracy — The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism'' (originally published in Swedish in 2000 as ''Nätokraterna - boken om det elektroniska klassamhället'', published in English by Reuters/Pearsall UK in 2002).

The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and Söderqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the netocracy, which they refer to as the consumtariat.

==The consumtariat==
Alexander Bard describes a new [[underclass]] called the consumtariat, a [[portmanteau]] of [[consumer]] and [[proletariat]], whose main activity is consumption, regulated from above. It is kept occupied with private problems, its desires provoked with the use of adverts and its active participation is limited to things like [[Consumer choice|product choice]], product customization, engaging with interactive products and life-style choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bard|first1=Alexander|last2=Sšderqvist|first2=Jan|title=The Netocracts: Futurica Trilogy 1|publisher=Stockholm Text|isbn=9789187173004|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=TeWCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberdeutocracy==
Similar to Netocracy, is the concept of Cyberdeutocracy. Karl W. Deutsch in his book The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, K. (1966). The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized about “information elites, controlling means of mass communication and, accordingly, power institutions, the functioning of which is based on the use of information in their activities.” Thus Deutsch introduced the concept of deutocracy, combining the words ‘ Deutsch’ and ‘ autocracy’ to get the new term
Combining terms 'deutocracy' and ‘ autocracy’ one can get a new term cyberdeutocracy. It is defined as a political regime, based on the control of the political and corporate elites of the information and communication infrastructure of the Internet space. 
Cyberdeutocracy, thus as its fundamental basis has such a resource as the global and managed virtual communication space within which the destruction of the existing, transformation, generation, and introduction in the public consciousness of alternative meanings, symbols, values, and ideas takes place, that shape perception society of political reality take place.The term was first introduced by Phillip Freiberg&lt;ref&gt; What are CyberSimulacra and Cyberdeutocracy?https://www.academia.edu/37288676/What_are_CyberSimulacra_and_Cyberdeutocracy_&lt;/ref&gt;, in his article that analyzed alleged Russian cyber involvement in 2016 U.S. elections, as well as banning people from social networks based on their political views.


==Other usages==
Netocracy can also refer to "Internet-enabled democracy" where issue-based politics will supersede party-based politics.

The word ''netocracy'' is also used as a [[portmanteau]] of ''Internet'' and ''democracy'', not of ''Internet'' and ''aristocracy'':
*"In Seattle, organized labor ran interference for the ragtag groups assembled behind it, marshaling several thousand union members who feared that free trade might send their jobs abroad. In Washington, labor focused on lobbying Congress over the China-trade issue, leaving the IMF and the World Bank to the ad hoc Netocracy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996690-4,00.html The New Radicals]; [[Time (magazine)]]; April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*"From his bungalow in Berkeley, he's spreading the word of grassroots netocracy to the Beltway. He formed an Internet political consulting firm with Jerome ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[San Francisco Chronicle]]; January 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9638">[[Image:Logosnks.gif|thumb|This logo, created by [[Glenn D. Paige]], explains the concept of nonkilling combining the ancient Asian [[yin-yang]] symbol with the recent brain research finding that stimulation of the pathways between systems of the brain controlling emotions and movement can assist change from violent to nonviolent human behavior. Analogously Creative Transformational Initiatives (blue), drawing upon Nonkilling Human Capabilities (white), can bring an end to Human Killing (red).]]

'''Nonkilling''' refers to the absence of killing, threats to kill, and conditions conducive to killing in human society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18 Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the use of the term in the academic world refers mostly to the killing of human beings, it is sometimes extended to include the killing of animals and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Kool and Rita Agrawal, "The Psychology of Nonkilling", in ''Toward a Nonkilling Paradigm'', edited by Joám Evans Pim. Honolulu: Center for Global Nonkilling, 2009 .&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case for the traditional use of the term "nonkilling" (or "non-killing") as part of [[Buddhist ethics]], as expressed in the first precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]],&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 187. Buddhist Scriptures in Pali language have explicit reference to nonviolence and nonkilling: monks should not only themselves abstain from killing but should also refrain from encouraging other people to kill themselves (Vinayapitaka III: .71-74)&lt;/ref&gt; and in similar terms throughout world spiritual traditions. (See [[:en:wikiversity:School:Nonkilling studies#Program on Nonkilling Spiritual Traditions|Nonkilling studies]]). Significantly, "nonkilling" has also been used recently in the "Charter for a World without Violence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/CHARTER/charter.htm 8th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, ''Charter for a World without Violence.'' Rome, December 15, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510024109/http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/CHARTER/charter.htm |date=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the 8th World Summit of [[Nobel Peace Laureate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"To address all forms of violence we encourage scientific research in the fields of human interaction and dialogue and we invite participation from the academic, scientific and religious communities to aid us in the transition to nonviolent, and nonkilling societies".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
In analysis of its causes, nonkilling encompasses the concepts of [[peace]] (absence of war and conditions conducive to war), [[nonviolence]] (psychological, physical, and structural), and [[ahimsa]] (noninjury in thought, word and deed).&lt;ref name="eolss.net"&gt;"Nonkilling Global Society", in Peace Building, edited by [[Ada Aharoni]], in ''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)'', Developed under the auspices of the [[UNESCO]], 2005, [http://www.eolss.net Eolss Publishers, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt; Not excluding any of the latter, nonkilling provides a distinct approach characterized by the measurability of its goals and the open-ended nature of its realization. While the usage of terms such as "nonviolence" and "peace" often follow the classical form of argument through abstract ideas leading to passivity, killing (and its opposite, nonkilling),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Approach==
On the other hand, nonkilling does not set any predetermined path for the achievement of a killing-free society in the same way as some ideologies and spiritual traditions that foster the restraint from the taking of life do. As an open-ended approach it appeals to infinite human creativity and variability, encouraging continuous explorations in the fields of education, research, social action and policy making, by developing a broad range of scientific, institutional, educational, political, economic and spiritual alternatives to human killing. Also, in spite of its specific focus, nonkilling also tackles broader social issues.&lt;ref name="nonkilling.org"&gt;http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to psychological aggression, physical assault, and torture intended to terrorize by manifest or latent threat to life, nonkilling implies removal of their psychosocial causes. In relation to killing of humans by socioeconomic structural conditions that are the product of direct lethal reinforcement as well as the result of diversion of resources for purposes of killing, nonkilling implies removal of lethality-linked deprivations. In relation to threats to the viability of the biosphere, nonkilling implies absence of direct attacks upon life-sustaining resources as well as cessation of indirect degradation associated with lethality. In relation to forms of accidental killing, nonkilling implies creation of social and technological conditions conducive to their elimination.&lt;ref name="eolss.net"/&gt;

In a broad conception, nonkilling opposes [[aggression]], [[assassination]], [[autogenocide]], [[contract killing]], [[corporate manslaughter]], [[cultural genocide]], [[capital punishment]], [[democide]], [[Domestic violence|domestic killings]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[ethnocide]], [[femicide]], [[feticide]], [[gendercide]], [[genocide]], [[honor killing]], [[Human sacrifice|ritual killings]], [[infanticide]], [[language death|linguicide]], [[mass murder]], [[murder–suicide]], [[Human extinction#Omnicide|omnicide]], [[policide]], [[politicide]], [[regicide]], [[school shooting]]s, [[structural violence]], [[suicide]], [[terrorism]], [[thrill killing]], [[tyrannicide]], [[violence]], [[war]], and other forms of killing, direct, indirect or structural.

==Data==
In his book ''[[Nonkilling Global Political Science]]'', [[Glenn D. Paige]] estimated that less than 0.5 percent of all humans that ever existed actually killed other humans.&lt;ref name="nonkilling.org"/&gt; Also, anthropological evidence points out that in certain societies and cultures killing is down to statistically insignificant levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/ peacefulsocieties.org]&lt;/ref&gt; As humans lived exclusively as hunter-gatherers — a form of existence that epitomizes the attributes of a nonkilling society — for 99 percent of their existence, it is also apparent that levels of violence and killing have also been very low during most of the history of ''Homo sapiens sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], '''''objet petit a''''' stands for the unattainable object of [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]]. It is sometimes called the object cause of desire. Lacan always insisted that the term should remain untranslated, "thus acquiring the status of an algebraic sign" (''Écrits'').

'The "a" in question stands for "''autre''" (other), the concept having been developed out of the Freudian "object" and Lacan's own exploitation of "otherness." &lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis'' (London 1994) p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic origins==

[[Jacques-Alain Miller]] pointed to the origins of object (a) in [[Freud]]'s 'lost object...the function that Freud discovered in the ''Three Essays''...and that [[Karl Abraham]] made the crux of his theory of development from which he derived the first premises of the "partial object"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Microscopia", in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, according to Miller, [[Melanie Klein]] 'located the partial object at the centre of psychic economy...hence it was that [[Winnicott]] glimpsed the [[transitional object]].' &lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Microscopia" p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; That long prehistory of object relations 'is what Lacan sums up, condenses, justifies and constructs with object ''a''.' &lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Microscopia" p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacanian development==

'In Lacan's seminars of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the evolving concept of the ''objet (petit) a'' is viewed in the ''[[matheme]]'' of phantasy as the object of desire sought in the other...a deliberate departure from British Object Relations psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 26n&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, in his Seminar ''Les formations de l'inconscient'', Lacan introduces the concept of ''objet petit a'' as the (Kleinian) imaginary part-object, an element which is imagined as separable from the rest of the body. In the Seminar ''Le transfert'' (1960–1961) he articulates objet a with the term ''agalma'' (Greek, an ornament). Just as the ''agalma'' is a precious object hidden in a worthless box, so ''objet petit a'' is the object of desire which we seek in the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. The "box" can take many forms, all of which are unimportant, the importance lies in what is "inside" the box, the cause of desire.

In the Seminars ''L'angoisse'' (1962–1963) and [[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis]] (1964), ''objet petit a'' is defined as the leftover, the remnant left behind by the introduction of the Symbolic in the [[Jacques Lacan#The Real|Real]]. This is further elaborated in the Seminar ''The Other Side of Psychoanalysis'' (1969–1970), where Lacan elaborates his [[Four discourses]]. In the discourse of the Master, one signifier attempts to represent the subject for all other signifiers, but a surplus is always produced: this surplus is ''objet petit a'', a surplus meaning, a surplus of [[jouissance]].

[[Slavoj Žižek]] explains this ''objet petit a'' in relation to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[MacGuffin]]: "[The] MacGuffin is ''objet petit a'' pure and simple: the lack, the remainder of the [[Jacques Lacan#The Real|Real]] that sets in motion the symbolic movement of interpretation, a hole at the center of the [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]], the mere appearance of some secret to be explained, interpreted, etc." (''Love thy symptom as thyself'').

==Hierarchy of ''object (a)''==

Speaking of the "fall" of the ''a'', Lacan noted that 'the diversity of forms taken by that object of the fall ought to be related to the manner in which the desire of the Other is apprehended by the subject.' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest form is 'something that is called the breast...this breast in its function as object, ''object a'' cause of desire.' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis'' (London 1994) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Next there emerges 'the second form: the anal object. We know it by way of the phenomenology of the gift, the present offered in anxiety.' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, "Introduction to the Names-of-the-Father Seminar", in ''Television'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The third form appears 'at the level of the genital act...[where] Freudian teaching, and the tradition that has maintained it, situates for us the gaping chasm of castration.' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Introduction" p. 85-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan also identified 'the function of ''petit a'' at the level of the scopophilic drive. Its essence is realized in so far as, more than elsewhere, the subject is captive of the function of desire.' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Introduction" p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The final term relates to 'the ''petit a'' source of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|superego]]...the fifth term of the function of ''petit a'', through which will be revealed the gamut of the object in its - pregenital - relation to the demand of the - post-genital - Other.' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Introduction" p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analyst and the ''a''==

For [[transference]] to take place, the analyst must incorporate the ''a'' for the analysand: 'analysts who are such only insofar as they are object - the object of the analysand'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Television'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For Lacan, 'it is not enough that the analyst should support the function of [[Tiresias]]. He must also, as [[Apollinaire]] tells us, have breasts' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis'' (London 1994) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; - must represent or incorporate the (missing) object of desire.

Working through the transference thereafter entails moving 'beyond the function of the ''a''': the 'analyst has to...be the support of the separating ''a'',' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan ''Concepts'' p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; so as to allow the analysis eventually to be completed. 'If the analyst during the analysis will come to be this object, he will also at the end of analysis not be it. He will submit himself to the fate of any object that stands in for ''a'', and that is to be discarded.' &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Schneiderman, ''Returning to Freud'' (New York 1980) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7604">{{otheruses|Pneuma (disambiguation)}}
In [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]], '''pneuma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|πνεῦμα}}) is the concept of the "breath of life," a mixture of the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|elements]] air (in motion) and fire (as warmth).&lt;ref&gt;"Stoicism," ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Originating among Greek medical writers who locate human vitality in the breath, pneuma for the Stoics is the active, generative principle that organizes both the individual and the [[cosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "[[Stoicism#Stoic physics and cosmology|Stoic Physics]] and [[Metaphysics]]," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; In its highest form, the pneuma constitutes the human soul (''psychê''), which is a fragment of the pneuma that is the soul of God. As a force that structures [[matter]], it exists even in inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'' (University of California Press, 2006), pp. 98-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of pneuma==
In the Stoic universe, everything is constituted of matter and pneuma. There are three grades or kinds of pneuma, depending on their proportion of fire and air.

* '''The pneuma of state or tension (''tonos'').''' This unifying and shaping pneuma provides stability or cohesion (''[[hexis]]'') to things; it is a force that exists even in objects such as a stone, log, or cup. The 4th-century Christian philosopher [[Nemesius]] attributes the power of pneuma in Stoic thought to its "tensile motion" (''tonicê kinêsis''); that is, the pneuma moves both outwards, producing [[Quantity#Background|quantity]] and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]], and at the same time inwards, providing unity and substance. An individual is defined by the equilibrium of its inner pneuma, which holds it together and also separates it from the world around it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. White, "Stoic Natural Philosophy (Physics and Cosmology)," p. 134, and Dorothea Frede, "Stoic Determinism," p. 186, both in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The pneuma as life force.''' The vegetative pneuma enables growth (''[[physis]]'') and distinguishes a thing as alive.
* '''The pneuma as soul.''' The pneuma in its most rarefied and fiery form serves as the animal soul (''psychê''); it pervades the organism, governs its movements, and endows it with powers of perception and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of pneuma is related to [[Aristotle]]'s theory that the pneuma in sperm conveys the capacity for locomotion and for certain sensory perceptions to the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen]], "The Vital Heat, the Inborn Pneuma and the Aether," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 77 (1957) 119–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth grade of pneuma may also be distinguished. This is the '''rational soul''' (''logica psychê'') of the mature human being, which grants the power of judgment.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pneuma and cosmology==
In Stoic [[cosmology]], everything that exists depends on two first principles which can be neither created nor destroyed: matter, which is passive and inert, and the ''[[Logos#Use in ancient philosophy|logos]]'', or divine reason, which is active and organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Baltzly, "Stoicism," ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd-century B.C. Stoic [[Chrysippus]] regarded pneuma as the vehicle of ''logos'' in structuring matter, both in animals and in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "Stoic Physics and Metaphysics," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Pneuma in its purest form can thus be difficult to distinguish from ''logos'' or the "constructive fire" (''pur technikon'')&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. White, "Stoic Natural Philosophy (Physics and Cosmology)," ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 136. White suggests that a number of Stoic terms are used interchangeably, or with subtle contextual distinctions, for the principle that acts on and within the physical world: ''pur, to hêgemonikon, pneuma, theos, nous, sperma, hexis, tonikê kinêsis.''&lt;/ref&gt; that drives the cyclical generation and destruction of the Stoic cosmos. When a cycle reaches its end in conflagration (''[[ekpyrôsis]]''), the cosmos becomes pure pneuma from which it regenerates itself.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics conceived of the cosmos as a whole and single entity, a living thing with a soul of its own,&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "Stoic Physics and Metaphysics," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'',  p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; a spherical continuum of matter held together by the orderly power of Zeus through the causality of the pneuma that pervades it. This divine pneuma that is the soul of the cosmos supplies the pneuma in its varying grades for everything in the world.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Furley, ''From Aristotle to Augustine'' (Routledge, 1999) p. 238; John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Christianity==
In his Introduction to the 1964 book ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact of [[Stoicism]] on [[Christianity]]. In particular:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another Stoic concept which offered inspiration to the Church was that of 'divine Spirit'. [[Cleanthes]], wishing to give more explicit meaning to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno's]] 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated – in the Christian as in the Stoic mind – with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 &lt;!--|ISBN=978-0-140-44140-6 --&gt; |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Green economics sidebar}}

The '''pollution haven hypothesis''' posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this often comes at the cost of environmentally unsound practices. [[Developing country|Developing nations]] with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

==Three scales of the hypothesis==
#[[Pollution control]] costs have an impact at the margins, where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows.
#Pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment.
#Countries set their environmental standards below socially-efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millimet|first=Daniel|title=Four New Empirical Tests of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis When Environmental Regulation is Endogenous|url=http://econ.tulane.edu/seminars/Millimet.pdf|publisher=Tulane University|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales 1 and 2 have empirical support, but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial.  One study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country's [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment.  However, that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country's neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country's trade flows.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH" /&gt;

==Formula and variations==
:Yi = αRi + XiβI + εi

In the above formula, Y is economic activity, R is regulatory stringency, X is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect Y and ε is an [[error term]].&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y.

There is also an expanded formula, as shown below:

:Yit = vi + αRit + γTit + θRitTit + X’βit + εit

This expanded formula takes into account whether [[trade liberalization]] (i.e. the level of [[trade barrier]]s that exist in a country, labeled as T) increases the negative correlation between economic activity (Y) and regulatory stringency (R).  Some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment, and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency, and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt;

== Connection with the environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|A simple recreation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, made using Microsoft Excel.]]
{{see also|Kuznets curve}}

The '''environmental Kuznets curve''' (EKC) is a conceptual model that suggests that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibara|first=Brian|title=Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/econ_honproj/21|work=Honors projects|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the EKC is potentially a reflection of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, because one of the factors that may drive the increase in [[environmental degradation]] seen in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]] is an [[global waste trade|influx of waste from post-industrial economies]].  This same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the EKC, which models post-industrial (service) economies. This model holds true in cases of national development, but cannot necessarily be applied at a local scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley, Perramond, Hapke, Laris|first=William G., Eric, Holly M., Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-8932-3|location=Oxford, UK|pages=179-180|quote=|via=Open edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world example==
Spent batteries that [[United States|Americans]] turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to [[Mexico]], where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States.  This increased export flow is a result of strict new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax.  In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2011, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries were being exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries would cross the border that year.  A significant proportion of this flow was being smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap.&lt;ref name="NY Times Lead Export Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|title=Lead from Old US Batteries Sent to Mexico Raises Risks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/science/earth/recycled-battery-lead-puts-mexicans-in-danger.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=14 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-waste dump site GDP per capita.png|thumb|Map of GDP PPP per-capita with known e-waste dump sites added in 2013.]]
The world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites (or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices) along with the [[Purchasing power parity|GDP PPP per-capita]] of those countries.&lt;ref name="e-waste dump locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where does e-waste end up?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Used EEE &amp; E-Waste Import and E-Waste Generated in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex I Countries.png|thumb|Shows an estimated amount of Used EEE and E-Waste imported into [[Kyoto Protocol]] Non-Annex 1 countries, with the E-Waste generated by each country's own domestic supplies.]] While GDP PPP per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development, and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven, this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer, relatively pre-industrial nations, which provides some rudimentary support for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.

==Areas of controversy ==
The first area of controversy with respect to the Pollution Haven Theory has to do with the formulas above.  Finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency (R) is not simple, because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction's environmental regulations.  The compliance costs stemming from these regulations, however, could come in the form of environmental taxes, regulatory delays, the threat or execution of lawsuits, product redesign, or emissions limits.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; This proliferation of cost styles makes R hard to quantify.

Another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens.  Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards.  However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin.  This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities, costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise [[efficiency]] concerns in an economic sense.

A final area of controversy is whether the Pollution Haven Hypothesis has empirical support.  For example, studies have found [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal, but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Ryan|title=The Pollution Haven Hypothesis: Significance and Insignificance|year=2006|publisher=Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory, as he writes, "At this point it's hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon, to the extent that it occurs, leads to international negative externalities. This does not, however, say that such examples cannot arise in the future."&lt;ref name="International Economics Theory &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=International Economics Theory and Policy|year=2006|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=9780321451347}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it, especially in the last 20 years.  Some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country, larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms.  This effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution, meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies, rather than the larger MNCs as theorized by other proponents of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Where Are The Pollution Havens?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birdsall|first=Nancy|author2=Wheeler, David|title=Trade Policy and Industrial Pollution in Latin America: Where Are the Pollution Havens?|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|date=January 1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=137–149|doi=10.1177/107049659300200107|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/2/1/137.full.pdf+html|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}
The '''problem of induction''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] question of whether [[inductive reasoning]] leads to [[knowledge]] understood in the [[Justified true belief|classic philosophical sense]],&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#CanIndJus "Can induction be justified?"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the apparent lack of justification for:

# Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that "all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white", before the discovery of [[black swan]]s) or
# Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the [[laws of physics]] will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |title=''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9662/pg9662.txt |work=Gutenberg Press }}#9662: Most recently updated in 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem calls into question all [[empirical]] claims made in everyday life or through the [[scientific method]], and, for that reason, the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] said that "induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy." Although the problem arguably dates back to the [[Pyrrhonism]] of [[ancient philosophy]], as well as the [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], [[David Hume]] popularized it in the mid-18th century.

== Formulation of the problem ==
[[File:Buck Creek IN - sunrise.jpg|thumb|Usually inferred from repeated observations: ''"The sun always rises in the east"''.]]
[[File:Vainaja kannethaan.jpg|thumb|Usually not inferred from repeated observations: ''"If someone dies, it's never me"''.]]
In [[inductive reasoning]], one makes a series of observations and [[inference|infers]] a new claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, [[David Hume]] would even argue that we cannot claim it is "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.

Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. [[Bertrand Russell]] illustrated this point in ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'':

{{Cquote
| quote = Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.
| 2 = 
}}

In several publications it is presented as a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;This story is found in Alan Chalmers, ''What is this thing Called Science'', Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient and early modern origins===
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic [[Sextus Empiricus]] first questioned the validity of inductive reasoning, positing that a universal rule could not be established from an incomplete set of particular instances. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars.

The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume's focus upon the [[circular reasoning]] of induction. However, Weintraub claims in [[The Philosophical Quarterly]]&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, R. (1995). What was Hume's Contribution to the Problem of Induction? The Philosophical Quarterly 45(181):460-470&lt;/ref&gt; that although Sextus's approach to the problem appears different, Hume's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is truthworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''ad infinitum''.}}

Although the [[regress argument|criterion argument]] applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus's argument "is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular." She concludes that "Hume's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction." She ends with a discussion of Hume's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern [[foundationalism]].

The [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]], a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Vol I, pg 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dasgupta - A history of Indian philosophy, Vol III. pg 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th century Indian skeptic, [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa|Jayarasi Bhatta]], also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Balcerowicz, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jayaraasi/ "Jayarāśi"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, 1987, Perception, Knowledge and Disbelief: A Study of Jayarāśi's Scepticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval writers such as [[al-Ghazali]] and [[William of Ockham]] connected the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J. (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 232-3, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duns Scotus]] however argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by "a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings'', trans. A. Wolter (Edinburgh:, 1962), 109-10; Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 17th-century [[Jesuits]] argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 223-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume &lt;!--'Hume's scepticism about induction' and 'Hume's skepticism about induction' redirect here--&gt;===
Few philosophers are as associated with induction as [[David Hume]]. He described the problem in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'', §4, based on his [[epistemology|epistemological]] framework. Here, "reason" refers to [[deductive reasoning]] and "induction" refers to [[inductive reasoning]].

First, Hume ponders the discovery of [[causality|causal relations]], which form the basis for what he refers to as "matters of fact". He argues that causal relations are found not by reason, but by induction. This is because for any cause, multiple effects are conceivable, and the actual effect cannot be determined by reasoning about the cause; instead, one must observe occurrences of the causal relation to discover that it holds. For example, when one thinks of "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another",&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others. Only through previous observation can it be predicted, inductively, what will actually happen with the balls. In general, it is not necessary that causal relation in the future resemble causal relations in the past, as it is always conceivable otherwise; for Hume, this is because the negation of the claim does not lead to a contradiction.

Next, Hume ponders the justification of induction. If all matters of fact are based on causal relations, and all causal relations are found by induction, then induction must be shown to be valid somehow. He uses the fact that induction assumes a valid connection between the proposition "I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect" and the proposition "I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects".&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; One connects these two propositions not by reason, but by induction. This claim is supported by the same reasoning as that for causal relations above, and by the observation that even rationally inexperienced people can infer, for example, that touching fire causes pain. Hume challenges other philosophers to come up with a (deductive) reason for the connection. If a deductive justification for induction cannot be provided, then it appears that induction is based on an inductive assumption about the connection, which would be [[begging the question]]. Induction, itself, cannot validly explain the connection.

In this way, the problem of induction is not only concerned with the uncertainty of conclusions derived by induction, but doubts the very principle through which those uncertain conclusions are derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#JusInd The Problem of Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction===
{{main|New riddle of induction}}
[[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled "The New Riddle of Induction". Goodman proposed the new [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] "[[Grue and Bleen|grue]]". Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson. ''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast'' (Fourth Edition). Harvard University Press, 1983, p.74, "will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/grue.html Goodman’s original definition of grue]&lt;/ref&gt;) observed to be green before a certain time ''t'', or blue if observed after that time. The "new" problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time ''t'' we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words:

– Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time ''t'').

– Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate "grue" will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after ''t'', will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far.

Goodman, however, points out that the predicate "grue" only appears more complex than the predicate "green" because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of "grue" and "bleen" (where bleen is blue before time ''t'', or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider "green" to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are "entrenched" in our language.

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] offers a practical solution to this problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Nicholas Rescher]]|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: Quine (1969), ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'', Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; by making the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim that only predicates that identify a "[[natural kind]]" (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. [[Roy Bhaskar|R. Bhaskar]] also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the  possibility  of  a  reason for the predicate,  located  in  the  enduring  nature  of  something.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Realist Theory of Science|last=Bhaskar|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-45494-0|location=New York|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green [[beryl]], made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.

==Notable interpretations==

===Hume===
{{See also|David Hume#Induction_and_causation|l1=David Hume on the problem of induction}}
Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in §5 of the ''Enquiry'', titled "Skeptical solution of these doubts". It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and "without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses."&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Stove and Donald Williams===
[[David Stove]]'s argument for induction, based on the [[statistical syllogism]], was presented in the ''Rationality of Induction'' and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late [[Donald Cary Williams]] (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book ''The Ground of Induction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Donald Cary Williams | title=The Ground of Induction | location=New York | publisher=Russell and Russell | year=1947 }}, {{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ |title=Donald Cary Williams |date=2015 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset "matches" the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or "representative" ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stove, ''The Rationality of Induction'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biting the Bullett: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa===
An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inacessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taking into account by [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] by considering that to be built a concept must be reapplied, what demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction &lt;ref&gt;"One form of Skepticism about Induction", in Richard Swinburne (ed.) ''The Justification of the Induction''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently - ''contra'' Hume - some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, what would make some inductive procedure always possible.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa: ''Philosophical Semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical Philosophy'', Appendix to Ch. V, CSP, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Karl Popper===
[[Karl Popper]], a [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], sought to solve the problem of induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification "begs for an authoritarian answer". Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| quote = I propose to replace ... the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?'
| isbn = 0-06-131376-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}}''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', section 43&lt;/ref&gt; Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so  there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Foundations of Scientific Inference
| author = [[Wesley C. Salmon]]
| year = 1967
| pages = 26
| accessdate = 27 December 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=Critical rationalism: A restatement and defense |date=1994 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a [[justificationism|justification]] for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bullemore, [https://www.academia.edu/4154895/Some_Remarks_on_the_Pragmatic_Problem_of_Induction "Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction"], Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece had previously shown in a number of international art venues, including New York's Museum of Modern Art ([[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]]) and London's [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/projects/rain-room|title=projects - Sharjah Art Foundation|website=www.sharjahart.org|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbican&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Rain Room'' allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet.&lt;ref name="Barbican" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/leisure/rain-room-brings-fun-intrigue-to-sharjah-1.2215470|title=Rain Room brings fun, intrigue to Sharjah|last=Reporter|first=Faisal Masudi, Staff|date=2018-05-02|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming "performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/projects/rain-room|title=projects - Sharjah Art Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sharjahart.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This site-specific sound and light installation uses 2,500 litres of self-cleaning recycled water, controlled through a system of 3D tracking cameras placed around the ceiling. The cameras detect a visitor's movement and signal groups of the water nozzles in the ceiling, stopping the flow of water in a roughly six-foot radius around the person.&lt;ref name="Barbican" /&gt;

Founded in 2005, Random International is a London-based collaborative studio for experimental and digital practice within contemporary art. Their work, which includes sculpture, performance and large-scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between man and machine and centres on audience interaction.&lt;ref name="Barbican" /&gt; 

Sharjah’s ''Rain Room'' is the work's Middle Eastern debut and the first installation of the project in a purpose-built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the Barbican, London (2012);&lt;ref name="Barbican" /&gt; MoMA, New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015) and [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], Los Angeles (2015–2017).

==Sharjah==
[[Sharjah Art Foundation]] constructed a purpose-built visitor centre located in the city's residential area of Al Majarrah to house the permanent installation of ''Rain Room'', with up to six visitors at a time taking fifteen minutes to explore the experience. Tickets are sold online for scheduled visits and cost Dhs25 for adults.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Opened in May 2018 by Ruler of Sharjah Dr Sheikh [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi|Sultan Bin Mohammad Al Qasimi]] together with Shaikha Hoor Bint Sultan Al Qasimi, president of Sharjah Art Foundation, ''Rain Room'' is part of the Sharjah Art Foundation Collection and the first of a series of artist-designed permanent spaces planned for Sharjah.

At the Sharjah inauguration, Koch and Ortkrass commented, "That Rain Room has found a permanent home at Sharjah Art Foundation is a humbling thought. The organisation [Sharjah Art Foundation] is unparalleled in its approach to art, exhibition-making and relationships with a wider public audience."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Previous installations==
Kate Bush (curator), Head of Art Galleries, Barbican Centre, said: "The Curve has previously played host to guitar-playing finches, a World War II bunker and a digital bowling alley.

"At the cutting edge of digital technology, Rain Room is a carefully choreographed downpour – a monumental installation that encourages people to become performers on an unexpected stage, whilst creating an intimate atmosphere of contemplation.

A '''Santa Claus machine''', named after the folkloric [[Santa Claus]], is a hypothetical machine that is capable of creating any required object or structure out of any given material. It is most often referenced by [[Futures studies|futurist]]s and [[science fiction]] writers when discussing hypothetical projects of enormous scale, such as a [[Dyson sphere]]. These types of future constructions would be too large for many civilizations to build directly, so they would need a series of machines to intelligently build the machine with little or no direct control.

==Origin==
The term was coined by [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] in 1978:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's possible to imagine a machine that could scoop up material – rocks from the Moon or rocks from asteroids – process them inside and produce just about any product: washing machines or teacups or automobiles or starships. Once such a machine exists it could gather sunlight and materials that it's sitting on, and produce on call whatever product anybody wants to name, as long as somebody knows how to make it and those instructions can be given to the machine. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discussion==
A mature Santa Claus machine requires significant advances in technology to be possible, including the ability to take any collection of matter and reconfigure it into any other type of matter.

Scientifically, it requires two parts: a disassembler and an assembler.

One form of disassembler would consist of an ionizing chamber, which heats the input matter to 43,000&amp;nbsp;°F (24,000&amp;nbsp;°C).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Once all the molecular bonds are broken and the electrons ripped off, each atomic nucleus would be moved through a magnetic field, where its path would curve in proportion to its charge/mass ratio, as per [[mass spectrometry]]. The separated ions would be captured by a linear array of cold traps to provide reservoirs of each element.

The assembler would use these reservoirs as input to some kind of [[3D printing|additive layer manufacturing]] device (also known as 3D printers and rapid prototype machines).  Many of these printers are commercially available today—though currently few can print with more than one highly prepared material (much less an alphabet consisting of all the raw elements).

An autonomous Santa Claus machine would presumably require a high level of [[artificial intelligence]], though for small projects, autonomous behavior is probably not necessary.  However, the "matter compiler" (that figures out which atom goes where) must be programmed appropriately—not a trivial task. A gigantic project such as a [[Dyson sphere]] would undoubtedly require not only autonomy, but also self-replication.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} These capabilities would enable a single Santa Claus machine, given sufficient matter and energy, to construct a project of any size.

Many theorists{{Who|date=August 2012}} have seen the obvious nightmare scenarios that accompany such a device, including machines running out of control and destroying an entire planet, or a [[clanking replicator]] disaster, ''à la'' the brooms in ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''. At the other extreme, others{{Who|date=August 2012}} suppose the resultant [[post scarcity]] [[economy]] could lead to a near-[[utopia]]—''[[Star Trek]]'' being the most culturally prominent example of this possibility.

The human society seen as a whole can be thought of as a limited Santa Claus machine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}
The '''semantic gap''' characterizes the difference between two descriptions of an object by different linguistic representations, for instance languages or symbols. According to Hein, the semantic gap can be defined as "the difference in meaning between constructs formed within different representation systems".&lt;ref name="Hein"&gt;Hein, A.M., Identification and Bridging of Semantic Gaps in the Context of Multi-Domain Engineering, Abstracts of the 2010 Forum on Philosophy, Engineering &amp; Technology. Colorado. [http://philengtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fPET2010-abstracts-5-1-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[computer science]], the concept is relevant whenever ordinary human activities, observations, and tasks are transferred into a computational representation.&lt;ref name="IRdef"&gt;Smeulders AWM, Worring M, Santini S, Gupta A, Jain R. Content-Based Image Retrieval at the End of the Early Years. IEEE Trans  Pattern Anal Mach Intell 2000;22(12):1349-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Multimediadef"&gt;Dorai C, Venkatesh S. Bridging the Semantic Gap with Computational Media Aesthetics. IEEE MultiMedia 2003;10(2):15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein"/&gt;

More precisely the gap means the difference between ambiguous formulation of contextual knowledge in a powerful language (e.g. [[natural language]]) and its sound, reproducible and computational representation in a [[formal language]] (e.g. [[programming language]]). [[Semantics]] of an object depends on the context it is regarded within. For practical application this means any formal representation of real world tasks requires the translation of the contextual expert knowledge of an application (high-level) into the elementary and reproducible operations of a computing machine (low-level). Since natural language allows the expression of tasks which are impossible to compute in a formal language there are no means to automatize this translation in a general way. Moreover, the examination of languages within the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] indicates that there is no formal and consequently automated way of translating from one language into another above a certain level of expressional power.

==Theoretical background==
The yet unproven but commonly accepted [[Church-Turing thesis]] states that a [[Turing machine]] and all equivalent formal languages such as the [[lambda calculus]] perform and represent all formal operations respectively as applied by a computing human. However the selection of adequate operations for the correct computation itself is not formally deducible, moreover it depends on the computability of the underlying problem. Tasks, such as the [[halting problem]], may be formulated comprehensively in natural language, but the computational representation will not terminate or does not provide a usable result, which is proven by [[Rice's theorem]]. The general expression of limitations for rule based deduction by Gödel's [[incompleteness theorem]] indicates that the semantic gap is never to be fully closed. These are general statements, considering the generalized limits of computation on the highest level of abstraction where the '''semantic gap''' manifests itself. There are however lots of subsets of problems which may be translated automatically, especially in the higher numbered levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.

==Formal languages==
Real world tasks are formalized by programming languages, which are executed on computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]]. Since programming languages are only comfortable representations of the Turing machine any program on a von Neumann computer has the same properties and limitations as the Turing machine or its equivalent representation. Consequently, every programming language such as CPU level machine code, assembler, or any high level programming language has the same expressional power as the underlying Turing machine is able to compute. There is no '''semantic gap''' between them since a program is transferred from the high level language to the machine code by a program, e.g. a [[compiler]] which itself runs on a Turing machine without any user interaction. The semantic gap actually opens between the selection of the rules and the representation of the task.

==Practical consequences==
Selection of rules for formal representations of real world applications, corresponds to writing a program. Writing programs is independent from the actual programming language and basically requires the translation of the domain specific knowledge of the user into the formal rules operating a turing machine. It is this transfer from contextual knowledge into formal representation which cannot be automatized with respect to the theoretical limitations of computation. Consequently, any mapping from real world applications into computer applications requires a certain amount of technical background knowledge by the user, where the '''semantic gap''' manifests itself.

It is a fundamental task of [[software engineering]] to close the gap between application specific knowledge and technically doable formalization. For this purpose domain specific (high-level) knowledge must be transferred into an algorithm and its parameters (low-level). This requires the dialogue between user and developer. Aim is always a software which allows the user to represent his knowledge as parameters of an algorithm without knowing the details of the implementation, and to interpret the outcome of the algorithm without the aid of the developer. For this purpose [[user interface]]s play the key role in software design, while developers are supported by [[Software framework|frameworks]] which help organizing the integration of contextual information.

==Examples==

===Document retrieval===
A simple example can be formulated as a series of increasingly difficult [[Natural language processing|natural language]] queries to locate a ''target document'' that may or may not exist locally on a known computer system.

'''Example queries''':
* 1) Locate any file in the known directory "/usr/local/funny".
* 2) Locate any file where the word "funny" appears in the filename.
* 3) Locate any [[text file]] where the word "funny" or the substring "humor" appears in the text.
* 4) Locate any [[mp3]] file where either "funny", "comic" or "humor" appears in the metadata.
* 5) Locate any file of any type related to humor.
* 6) Locate any image that is likely to make my grandmother laugh.

The progressive difficulty of these queries is represented by the increasing degree of abstraction from the types and semantics defined the system architecture (directories and files on a known computer) to the types and semantics that occupy the realm of ordinary human discourse (subjects such as "humor" and entities such as "my grandmother"). Moreover, this disparity of realms is further complicated by [[leaky abstraction]]s, such as is common in the case of query 4), where the ''target document'' may exist, but may not encapsulate the "metadata" in a manner expected by the user, nor the designer of the query processing system.

===Image analysis===
Image analysis is a typical domain for which a high degree of abstraction from low-level methods is required, and where the '''semantic gap''' immediately affects the user. If image content is to be identified to understand the meaning of an image, the only available independent information is the low-level pixel data. Textual annotations always depend on the knowledge, capability of expression and specific language of the annotator and therefore is unreliable. To recognize the displayed scenes from the raw data of an image the algorithms for selection and manipulation of pixels must be combined and parameterized in an adequate manner and finally linked with the natural description. Even the simple linguistic representation of shape or color such as round or yellow requires entirely different mathematical formalization methods, which are neither intuitive nor unique and sound.
[[File:Semantic Gap.svg|thumb|Semantic gap in the context of image analysis|400x400px]]

===Layered systems===
In many [[layered system]]s, some conflicts arise when concepts at a high level of abstraction need to be translated into lower, more concrete [[Artifact (information theory)|artifact]]s. This mismatch is often called '''semantic gap'''.

===Databases===
[[OODBMS]]s (object-oriented database management system) advocates sometimes claim that these databases help to reduce the semantic gap between the application domain ([[miniworld]]) and the traditional RDBMS systems. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISJ/is_n2_v33/ai_15519487/pg_4]. However Relational proponents would posit the exact opposite, because by definition object databases fix the data being recorded into a single binding abstraction.

'''Shahnaz Bukhari''' (or '''Bokhari''') is a [[Pakistan]]i clinical psychologist and women's rights activist. She is founder and director of the [[non-governmental organization]], [[Progressive Women's Association]] (PWA), which documents and opposes [[violence against women]].

==Education and work==
She holds a Master's of Science from [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], [[Lahore]]. After graduation, she worked as a family counselor in Saudi Arabia for seven years. On returning to Pakistan in 1984, Bukhari observed that there were no services for victims of violence and resolved to fill the void. She founded the Progressive Women's Association (PWA) the following year, an organization to help female victims of social and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/21-leaders-the-21st-century/031223/seven-who-stretch-their-reach-across-cultures |title=21 Leaders for the 21st Century |author=Carline Bennett |date=23 December 2003 |work=We News |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the PWA also began taking on cases of acid and burn victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2009/text/local8.htm |title=Maria Shah — another acid attack file closed? |author=Zofeen T. Ebrahim |date=16 February 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also edits and publishes the magazine ''Women's World''.&lt;ref name=WRMEA/&gt;

The same year, the PWA successfully lobbied Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] to have all-female police stations established. In 1999, Bukhari converted her family home in [[Rawalpindi]] into AASSRA, Pakistan's first shelter home for battered women with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=838&amp;year=2008 |title=

Kristof |date=30 October 2008 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Bukhari was arrested for "abetting an attempt to commit adultery" after sheltering a woman from an abusive husband at AASSRA. She was cleared of the charges two years later.&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio"/&gt; According to Bukhari, she and her family have also received numerous threats as well as subject to frequent police raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilcourageprize.org/bukhari-remarks.htm |title=Shahnaz Bukhari Civil Courage Prize Address |author=Shahnaz Bukhari |date=15 October 2003 |publisher=Civil Courage Prize |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She is the single parent of two sons and two daughters, the eldest of which serves as her chief assistant. Her former husband lives in the United States.&lt;ref name=WRMEA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0896/9608080.htm |title=Shahnaz Bukhari—A Single-Minded Activist for Women's Rights |author=Richard H.

==Awards and recognitions==
Bukhari won the [[Civil Courage Prize]] of the US-based [[Train Foundation]] in 2003, awarded for "steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk — rather than military valor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilcourageprize.org/honorees.htm |title=Civil Courage Prize |year=2010|publisher=civilcourageprize.org |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/partypictures/2003/10.29.03/partypictures10.29.03.php |title=David Patrick Columbia's New York Social Diary |date=29 October 2003 |publisher=newyorksocialdiary.com |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, [[Women's eNews]] named her one of "21 Leaders for the 21st Century".&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio" /&gt;

[[File:Nepali Woman Smiles.jpg|thumb|A [[People of Nepal|Nepali]] Newar woman smiling]]

A '''smile''' is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the [[muscle]]s at the sides of the [[Human mouth|mouth]]. It is believed it takes about 42 muscles to smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freitas-Magalhães |first=A. |last2= Castro|first2= E.=|title=Facial Expression: The Brain and The Face |pages=1–18 |location=Porto |publisher=University Fernando Pessoa Press |isbn=978-989-643-034-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the [[human eye|eyes]], an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.

Among [[human]]s, smiling is an expression denoting [[pleasure]], [[socializing|sociability]], [[happiness]], [[joy]] or [[amusement]]. It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of [[anxiety]] known as a [[wikt:Special:Search/grimace|grimace]]. Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carroll E. |last=Izard |year=1971 |title=The Face of Emotion |location=New York |publisher=Appleton-Century-Croft |isbn=0-390-47831-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are large differences among different cultures, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Girl Portrait Kid Cute Hair Sunlight Arab Young.jpg|thumb|left|220xp|An [[Arabs|Arab]] girl smiling]]
Primatologist Signe Preuschoft traces the smile back over 30 million years of evolution to a "fear grin" stemming from monkeys and apes who often used barely clenched teeth to portray to predators that they were harmless, or to signal submission to more dominant group members. The smile may have evolved differently among species and especially among humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-do-we-smile-and-laugh-when-were-terrified-1441046376|title=Why do we smile and laugh when we're terrified?|last=Inglis-Arkell|first=Esther|date=7 October 2013|website=io9.com|publisher=io9.com|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Biology as an academic discipline that interprets the smile, those who study [[kinesics]] and [[psychology]] such as [[Freitas-Magalhaes]] view the smile as an [[affect display]] that can communicate feelings such as love, happiness, glee, pride, contempt, and embarrassment. Also, other types of primates can express this gesture as a symbol of happiness and fun.

== Social effects ==
A smile seems to have a favorable [[Social influence|influence]] upon others and makes one likable and more approachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gladstone |first=G. |title=When you’re smiling, does the whole world smile for you? |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |year=2002 |volume=10 |issue= |pages=144–146 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1665.2002.00423.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social context, smiling and [[laughter]] have different functions in the order of sequence in social situations:
* Smiling is sometimes a pre-laughing device and is a common pattern for paving the way to laughter;
* Smiling can be used as a response to laughter in the previous turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haakana |first=M. |title=Laughter and smiling:  Notes on co-occurrences |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |year=2010 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1499–1512 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information of many different forms. One of these is advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing [[sex appeal]]. However, recent research indicates a man's smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective.  The researchers ignored the role of smiles in other sexual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jessica L. |last=Tracy |first2=Alec T. |last2=Beall |title=Happy Guys Finish Last: The Impact of Emotion Expressions on Sexual Attraction |journal=[[Emotion (journal)|Emotion]] |volume=11 |issue=6 |year=2011 |pages=1379–1387 |url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Guys...in-pres-Emotion.pdf |doi=10.1037/a0022902 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626032707/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Guys...in-pres-Emotion.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of smiling on others is not necessarily benign. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[superficial smile]].

== Cultural differences ==
[[File:Eating rice, China - collected by Berthold Laufer.jpg|thumb|In the 19th century and early 20th century, photographs didn't often depict smiling people in accordance to cultural conventions of Victorian and Edwardian culture. In contrast, the photograph ''Eating Rice, China'' reflects differing cultural attitudes of the time, depicting a smiling Chinese man. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Phil|title=Why people never smiled in old photographs|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs|website=Vox|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While smiling is perceived as a positive emotion most of the time, there are many [[cultures]] that perceive smiling as a negative expression and consider it unwelcoming. Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or [[dishonesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Tidwell |url=http://www.andrews.edu/~tidwell/bsad560/NonVerbal.html |title=Non Verbal Communication |publisher=Andrews.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of [[Asia]], people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the [[former Soviet Union]] area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/advising/american_culture/social_skills/nonverbal_communication/reading_exercise.htm |title=Nonverbal Communication |publisher=Rpi.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dimples ==
[[File:VirgilGriffithFace.jpg|thumb|A man with cheek [[dimples]] smiling.]]
[[Dimple|Cheek dimples]] are visible indentations of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], caused by underlying flesh, which form on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait. A rarer form is the single dimple, which occurs on one side of the face only. Anatomically, dimples may be caused by variations in the structure of the facial muscle known as [[zygomaticus major muscle|zygomaticus major]]. Specifically, the presence of a double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle may explain the formation of cheek dimples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pessa |first=Joel E. |title=Double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle: Anatomy, incidence, and clinical correlation |year=1998 |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=310–313 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2353(1998)11:5&lt;310::AID-CA3&gt;3.0.CO;2-T |pmid=9725574|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the [[zygomatic bone]]. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth.

== Duchenne smile ==
[[File:Smiling girl.jpg|thumb|A Duchenne smile engages the muscles around the mouth and eyes.]]

While conducting research on the [[physiology]] of facial expressions in the mid-19th century, French neurologist  [[Guillaume Duchenne]] identified two distinct types of smiles. A Duchenne smile involves contraction of both the [[zygomaticus major muscle|zygomatic major muscle]] (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]] (which raises the cheeks and forms [[wrinkle (skin)|crow's feet]] around the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnicky|first=Alex|title=Body Language - Common Myths and How to use it effectively|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/303r1clvpjwghja/Body-Language.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchenne smile has been described as "smizing", as in "smiling with the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Darryl|title=How to Design a Life Worth Smiling About: Developing Success in Business and in Life|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071819879|page=8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DHbhAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An exaggerated Duchenne smile is associated with lying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.co.uk/93854/how-facial-software-can-identify-liars How facial software can identify liars May 25, 2018]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Duchenne, Guillaume (1990). ''The Mechanism of Human Facial Expression''. New York: Cambridge University Press. Translated by R. Andrew . Originally published as ''Mecanisme de la Physionomie Humaine'' in 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; "Research with adults initially indicated that joy was indexed by generic smiling, any smiling involving the raising of the lip corners by the zygomatic major [...]. More recent research suggests that smiling in which the muscle around the eye contracts, raising the cheeks high (Duchenne smiling), is uniquely associated with positive emotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Messinger |first=D. S. |last2=Fogel |first2=A. |last3=Dickson |first3=K. |year=2001 |title=All smiles are positive, but some smiles are more positive than others |journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=642–653 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan Am smile, also known as the "[[Botox]] smile", is the name given to a fake smile, in which only the [[zygomatic major muscle]] is voluntarily contracted to show politeness. It is named after the now defunct airline [[Pan American World Airways]], whose flight attendants would always flash every passenger the same perfunctory smile.&lt;ref name="panam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harlow|first=John|title=The smile that says where you’re from|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article516707.ece|accessdate=18 January 2011|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=February 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Botox was introduced for cosmetic use in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Andrea|title=FDA approves Botox Cosmetic to improve the appearance of crow’s feet lines|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm367662.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic use of Botox injections to deal with eye wrinkle can result in the paralysis of the small muscles around the eyes, preventing the appearance of a Duchenne smile.

== In animals ==

In animals, the baring of teeth is often used as a [[threat display|threat or warning display]]—known as a [[snarl]]—or a sign of [[submission]]. For [[chimpanzees]], it can also be a sign of [[fear]]. However, not all animal displays of teeth convey negative acts or emotions. For example, [[Barbary macaque]]s demonstrate an open mouth display as a sign of playfulness, which likely has similar roots and purposes as the human smile.&lt;ref name="smile"&gt;Preuschoft, Signe. "'Laughter' and 'Smile' in Barbary Macaques (''Macaca Sylvanus'')". Ethology 91.3 (1992): 220-36. {{doi|10.1111/j.1439-0310.1992.tb00864.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==

The object of a stimulus–response model is to establish a mathematical function that describes the relation ''f'' between the stimulus ''x'' and the [[expected value]] (or other measure of location) of the response ''Y'':{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

: &lt;math&gt;E(Y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

A common simplification assumed for such functions is linear, thus we expect to see a relationship like

: &lt;math&gt;E(Y) = \alpha + \beta x.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Statistical theory]] for [[linear model]]s has been well developed for more than fifty years, and a standard form of analysis called [[linear regression]] has been developed.

'''Stuart H. Harris''' is an English author of books and articles about the internet, and internet consultant, now living in California, United States. He is a computer professional, an expert on [[IRC]] and has written a book on the subject, ''IRC Survival Guide: Talk to the World with Internet Relay Chat'', published in 1995 by [[Addison-Wesley]], {{ISBN|978-0-201-41000-6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Harris:, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=527027 Manual on Internet Relay Chat].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/irc-survival-guide-talk-to-the-world-with-internet-relay-chat/oclc/624419378?referer=br&amp;ht=edition WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a performer with three years experience as a semi-professional actor on the festival circuit, two years as a professional in London and in provincial repertory theatre, and further experience as a director in television. The aforementioned extensive cross-disciplinary experience motivated Harris to explore the potential of creating a [[Shakespeare]] performance online; namely, a contemporary production of Shakespeare's Hamlet known as ''Hamnet''.

== Internet relay chat==
Harris has written several works on the use of IRC (internet relay chat) and other internet mediums. His best-known book is ''The irc Survival Guide; talk to the world with Internet Relay Chat''  &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Harris "The IRC Survival Guide"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 when the book was published, irc was the latest in a fast-growing line of communication technologies. The downside of irc was the complicated language required to create commands (actions). However, Harris' book was written with the intention of using five simple commands to make the most of an otherwise complicated client, for those who have no background in computer or internet programming.

== The Hamnet Players ==

[[The Hamnet Players]] introduced Harris' idea of Internet-based theatre on 12 December 1993 in their performance of the 80-line script adaption, "Hamnet"; on 6 February 1994, featuring the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s Ian Taylor as the principal character. A follow-up performance entitled "PCbeth: an IBM clone of Macbeth" was created, with a  world premier  on the date of stimulus playwright Shakespeare's 430th birthday, 23 April 1994. ''PCbeth'' consisted of a 160-line pastiche, which instigated theuse in virtual performances of  images via JPEG files offered to participants with the capability to receive and exhibit them. The production was restaged on 10 July 1994, accommodating VIP guest stars and several audio effects. {{citation needed |date=November 2011}}

Following this, the company adapted American playwright Tennessee William's ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' into the IRC-revised version ''An IRC Channel Named Desire''. The production was staged twice: on 30 October 1994, and on 12 February 1995.

Use of the name The Hamnet Players &lt;ref name="hambule.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hambule.co.uk/hamnet/about.htm |title=About the Hamnet Players |publisher=Hambule.co.uk |date=23 April 1994 |accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests Stuart Harris' intention was to create a virtual repertory theatre company, which would become steadily more established over the course of time, and several productions. However, although Harris found it beneficial to cast several ''regular'' virtual actors, who formed the foundations of the players, and supported its intentions, the collaboration better resembled an ever-expanding and interchanging assemblage of enthusiasts than one perpetually definite troupe. As such, The Hamlet Players generally experience frequent cast turnovers.

Founded in 1993, the online company's name resonates culturally in several ways; relating not simply to the clear play on the original script's title of ''[[Hamlet]]'', but, additionally, to the colloquial English term for an overzealous actor – a "ham". Stuart Harris in addition considered the potential "mixed reality" performance's wide possible levels of audience accessibility, regardless of financial or locational constraints; because the name "Hamnet Players" can also be linked to the term "pirate" or "ham" radio: unregulated channels of radio communication(made popular in the western world in the 1950s and 60s), operated by amateur broadcasters outside of the legal broadcast network; consequently enabling Hamnet's staging to also be linked to contemporary "hacker culture".  The basis of IRC has all the foundations for any performance- users can choose the name by which they want to be known, and there are many hundreds of thousands of users who choose not to chat but to simply watch and read what goes on. Therefore, using character names such as "Ophelia" and "Hamlet", as well as using [[HTML]] actions, gives the potential to introduce a very considerable alternative to traditional live performance platforms.

Harris' intention for development of The Hamnet Players' work was to ultimately create web-based formats of every stage of theatrical production, in addition to performance; including casting calls, auditions and callbacks; the entire rehearsal process; marketing and production critique.

In her paper "Curtain Time 20:00 GMT; Experiments with Virtual Theater on Internet Relay Chat", Brenda Danet says this of Stuart Harris' version of ''Hamlet'', Hamnet:
"...gross reduction of the length of the text and caricaturization of plot and action, along with transformation of hallowed Renaissance poetry into late 20th century colloquial prose and even lowly slang ... transform the play into a kind of typed Punch and Judy show" &lt;ref&gt;Brenda Danet Curtain Time 20:00 GMT; Experiments with Virtual Theater on Internet Relay Chat  http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol1/issue2/intro.html#Comptheater&lt;/ref&gt;

== Live or mediated performance==

"Since all participants in an IRC conversation may choose whatever nickname they wish to be known by... and since an IRC channel may contain many people who watch, but contribute nothing... some of the elements of traditional theatre are [still] there."
(Harris, 1995, 500)

Live or mediated performance is based on the idea that Mediated performance is one that is recorded or broadcast. The technique used by the Hamnet Players, initiated by Stuart Harris, is that each of the cast's script lines are numbered and no one has the full script apart from the production team. In this way, not even the players fully know what will unfold until the live chat performance.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Danet, Cyberpl@y:communicating online&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Harris drew on his experience of IRC to create a virtual theatre company focused on creating "mixed reality" cyberperformance. One of the advantages of performing entirely online was the ability for company members to be in cross-country or even internationally varied locations simultaneously—members could rehearse at any time, from anywhere. Following around a year of online experimentation, and directed by Harris, the cybertheatre company performed a contemporary script-based version of Shakespeare's Hamlet specifically adapted for IRC in December 1993. Broadcast from an IRC channel based in San Diego, the production appeared on computer screens across the world; and was performed for a second time in February with RSC member Ian Taylor as the principal character. The usual script-based format of IRC, and its use of dialogue as the primary communication method, present the facility as an ideal platform for performing text-based drama experimentally. The online potential for spontaneity and improvisation was both realised and cursed, however, when a bot unintentionally killed Hamlet halfway through the production.
Mary L. Anglin&lt;ref&gt;Mary L Anglin, Her Thesis on Internet Performance http://marylanglin.com/Wholethesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantageously, despite Stuart Harris' focus on spontaneity, the director's choice of IRC as performance format allowed copies of the production to be documented via online performance logs; granting preservation of improvised lines, character depictions and described actions offered by actors, and textual cues(such as emoticons) regularly used in net communications as a replacement for facial and vocal cues relied on in face-to-face conversation.

== Superseding developments==

'''Verbal language in dreams''' is the speech—most commonly in the form of a dialogue between the dreamer him/herself and other dream characters—which forms part of the overall (mostly imagistic) dream scenario. Historically, there have been abundant references to verbal language in dreams going back millennia.  Early in the twentieth century German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] presented a large corpus of dream speech, almost all from his own dreams and virtually all deviant, without any pretense that this was representative of dream speech in general. The first systematic elicitation of verbal language in dreams from a large subject pool under methodological protocols was presented beginning in the early 1980s, along with detailed analyses as well as theoretical consideration of the implications for various dream models, from the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] approach to more recent theories.

==Dream language in history==
Traditionally, dreams have been defined predominantly in imagistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the German psychologist K.A. Scherner in his book ''Das Leben des  Traumes'' (1861, cited by Freud 1900/1953 ''The Interpretation of Dreams,'' in James Strachey ed. and trans. ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud,'' vols 4-5, Hogarth Press, p. 84) states that the dreaming imagination is "without the power of conceptual speech [and therefore] obliged to paint what it says pictorially"; Funk and Wagnall's Standard Dictionary of the English Language of 1895 defined "to dream" as "to have a train of images or fantasies pass through the mind in sleep"; a recent edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' defines dream as a "vision, series of pictures or events presented to the sleeping person."&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent dream theories of the modern era from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic model (1900) to the present have similarly placed emphasis of the visual aspects of dreams. Yet, even the earliest of written sources, such as the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 28: 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Odyssey]]&lt;ref&gt;Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; make clear that dreams need not be "[[silent movies]]"; they may be "[[talking pictures|talkies]]" incorporating a "sound track" abounding in verbal dialogues or monologues.&lt;ref&gt;Verbal language in dreams is distinct from the phenomenon of [[sleeptalking]], that is, actual articulation out loud during sleep. As reported from a series of experiments by Alan Arkin (''Sleeptalking: Psychology and Psychophysiology''; Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc., 1981), most sleeptalking occurs not during [[REM-sleep]] (the neurological periods of sleep most associated with vivid dreaming) but during non-REM sleep. Even of those sleeptalking episodes which do occur during REM sleep, only about half show any obviously discernible relation with the dream reports elicited from the subject when awakened immediately following the sleeptalking.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by Heynick of several books containing over 300 dreams, both genuine reports and dreams incorporated into works of fiction, showed that some three-quarters contained verbal dialogue or explicit reference to speech in the dream.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; As a specimen of a dream with dialogue as part of a famous work of fiction, Heynick cites the dream of Charles Swann, the main character in [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'s ''[[Swann's Way]]'' (1913; italics added):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The painter remarked to Swann [the dreamer] ''that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. "They had obviously arranged it between them,"'' he added; ''"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together, it might have looked odd. She is his mistress."'' The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavored to console him. ''"After all, she is quite right,"'' he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off his fez to make him feel more at ease. ''"I've advised her to do that myself a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her."''&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1906 Kraepelin, a pioneer of the somatic approach to psychiatry and of the methodical classification of psychiatric disorders, published a 105-page monograph ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume'' (On Speech Disorders in Dreams).&lt;ref&gt;Emil Kraepelin 1906 ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume''; Engelmann Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests, Kraepelin's declared aim was to analyze only deviant specimens of speech from dreams. Specimens reflecting correct speech processes were excluded from his study. To this end, Kraepelin assembled in the course of twenty years 286 specimens, the vast majority drawn from his own dreams, with no pretense to nonselectivity. He apparently drew in large measure from [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] and occasionally [[hypnopompic]] dreamlets (experienced when falling asleep and waking up), which differ [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomologically]] from full-fledged dreams and are characterized by different neurological indices as well.

Kraepelin meticulously classified his collection of dreams according to the nature of the deviances from correct normal speech in wakefulness.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; Three-fifths of his specimens were grouped as disorders of word selection, including large numbers of neologisms (non-existing words, typically formed by combinations of existing words or their components); just over one-fifth as disorders of discourse (actaphasia, usually involving the incorrect choice of language dependency relations; and agrammatism, the faulty construction of complex sentences); and just under one fifth as disorders of thought. Although it was well known at the time that the speech of normal people in wakefulness is often fraught with errors,&lt;ref&gt;In 1895 Rudolf Meringer and [[Karl Mayer]] published ''Versprechen und Verlesen, eine psychologische-linguistische Studie'' (Slips of Speech and Reading, a Psychological-Linguistic Study) containing and analyzing over 8000 specimens of linguistic errors from normal people in waking life; this study is mentioned in Kraepelin's monograph.&lt;/ref&gt; Kraepelin prized his corpus of deviant dream speech for the profound nature of many of the errors they contained, different from the common slips of the tongue made by mentally healthy people in everyday life. He likened various specimens of his dream speech corpus to the speech in waking life of patients with dementia praecox (schizophrenia), speech confusion, and aphasia. Kraeplin saw his dream experiences as affording him (a normal person) first-hand insight into these pathological processes. He further speculated on neurological concomitants involving the activities and interaction of areas of the brain—the [[cerebral cortex]], [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's coil]], [[Broca's area|Broca's coil]]—which are different from in normal wakefulness. Although several of Kraepelin's dream speech specimens are amenable to interpretation for their latent sexual significance,&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;  he had no interest in the psychoanalytic approach and made no reference to his contemporary Freud in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Kraepelin's full 1906 monograph is published in English translation in Heynick (1993), which also includes English translations of three relevant shorter pieces by Kraepelin's contemporaries Ernst Meumann, Friederich Hacker, and [[Alfred Hoche]]. In the mid-1980s a cache of Kraepelin's notations was discovered in Munich which showed that for two decades after the publication of his 1906 monograph he had continued to record specimens of his dream speech, an additional 391 in toto. These, too, were included in Heynick (1993), presented for the first time in their original German as well as in English translation along with Kraepelin's notes and an analysis and categorization by the author. Verbal material presented in print in dreams and read by the dreamer, a phenomen treated by Meumann and mentioned by Freud (1900) and Kraepelin (1906), is considered in Heynick (1993), pp. 52-62 and in Frank Heynick 1985 "Verbal behavior in dreams; neurobiological implications for LSP reading?," in A.K. Pugh &amp; J.M. Ulijn (eds.) ''Reading for Professional Purposes: Studies and Practices in Native and Foreign Languages''. Heinemann, pp.321-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, therefore, no indices or standards existed that were representative of the verbal language component of the dreams of a large general population. But beginning in 1983, Heynick reported in a series of publications the results of two experiments designed to evaluate, first, the linguistic competence and, subsequently, the pragmatic competence of the dreamer in the dreaming state, using large subject pools drawn from the general population (in this case in the [[Netherlands]]) and following careful protocols designed to avoid selectivity and maximize accuracy of recall.

==Linguistic performance==
The term "linguistic performance," central to this experiment, derives from the transformational-generative (TG) revolution in linguistics in the second half of the twentieth century and the concomitant emergence of the field of formal psycholinguistics. The TG model of language generation assumes an ideal "linguistic competence" on the part of the speaker, theoretically enabling him or her to generate all the infinite number of well-formed sentences in the native language while generating none of the ill-formed sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 212-14&lt;/ref&gt; That in actual use, i.e., linguistic performance, the speaker is limited in, among other things, the complexity or elaboration of the sentences he or she can generate, and often produces utterances which are ill-formed, is due to the limitations of the various auxiliary psychological mechanisms at the speaker's disposal, such as limited short-term memory, perceptual limitations, and defective feedback, as well as to factors such as deliberate changes in structure in mid-sentence, and unconscious interference of the Freudian type.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Victoria A. Fromkin, ed., 1980 ''Errors in Linguistic Performance: Slips of the Tongue, Ear, Pen, and Hand'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the above has traditionally applied to the native speaker in the waking state. The experiment explored the linguistic performance of the native speaker in the dreaming state.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.223-45; Frank Heynick 1991 "Linguistic and literary creativity in dreams: a psychoanalytic and experimental approach," in J. Gackenbach (ed.) ''Dream Images'', pp.79-86, Baywood.&lt;/ref&gt;

78 Dutch subjects sleeping at home recorded on special forms following precise protocol instructions a total of 566 Dutch utterances directly recalled and transcribed from 566 dreams which had been in progress prior to alarm clock awakening in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 223-28&lt;/ref&gt; (For just over 80 percent of all awakenings, there was either no dream in progress at the time of awakening or no verbal material to be reported from the dream.) The subjects reported (as part of the questionnaire form) that 60 percent of the utterances were said by him or herself in the dream scenario; 40 percent by someone else, usually addressed to the dreamer.
 
Word-count analysis showed the utterances in the corpus to have a wide range of length, with a  mean utterance length of 7.5 words and a mean sentence length of 6.5 words. The declarative sentences in the corpus were analyzed for complexity (sentential elaboration) using in particular the number of subordinate clauses per unit as an index. The corpus when classed into three groups according to the education level of the subject-dreamers showed that those with most education had the highest sentential elaboration; those with the least, the lowest; with those with intermediate education scoring in between. (There were no standards available for absolute comparison with the sentential elaboration in spoken Dutch in waking life by the three education-level groups in the general population; however, the relative degree of sentential elaboration of the dream corpus of the three education-level groups accorded with the relative indices for written Dutch by the three educational-level groups, which were available for comparison.)&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.239-241&lt;/ref&gt;

72 of the 566 utterances were marked by their respective subjects (in response to one of the questions on the form) as deviating from wakeful usage, although analysis of the same specimens by two academic linguists deemed the large majority of those marked utterances to be fully acceptable Dutch. Fewer than 5 percent of all utterances clearly deviated from correct wakeful speech. These included semantic anomalies, faulty lexical substitutions, neologisms (word-blends), non-existent proper names, language mixing, and (in two instances) syntactic errors.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.225-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatic competence==
The subjects in the above experiment were not asked to report the full dream scenario during which the utterances were made. Excluded, therefore, from the analysis was any consideration of "pragmatic competence," the "knowledge of condition and manner or appropriate use [of his or her linguistic ability] in conformity with various purposes,"&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky 1980 ''Rules and Representations''; Basil Blackwell p.224; Chomsky, the founder of TG linguistics viewed pragmatic competence as outside the scope of TG&lt;/ref&gt; which forms part of the broader field of language psychology (rather than formal psycholinguistics).
 
Dream utterances ''plus'' their dream scenario contexts were gathered in a second experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.254-259; Frank Heynick 1986 "The dream-scripter and the Freudian ego: pragmatic competence and superordinate and subordinate cognitive systems in sleep," ''Journal of Mind and Behavior'', 7 (2/3), pp.169-201&lt;/ref&gt; again following carefully defined protocols, this time using the telephone elicitation technique. (Volunteer subjects were awakened on random nights at random hours, on average no more than once a week.) 77 dream reports from 33 subjects were tape-recorded and transcribed. These contained 92 dream speech utterances elicited verbatim from the subjects immediately after provoked awakening (to minimize deterioration in memory recall) plus an additional 113 utterances (81 in direct verbatim form, 32 in indirect form) contained in the subsequent telling of the entire dream. 40 percent of the utterances were said by the dreamer; 60 percent by someone else in the dream scenario, usually addressed to the dreamer (a reversal of the proportions in the linguistic performance experiment).

Five scorers, working independently but achieving a high degree of interscorer reliability, rated the appropriateness of each of the 205 dreams utterances to their situational context in the dream. Averaged out (and rounded off), 67% of the utterances were deemed to be "entirely suitable to the narrative"; 20% "not entirely suitable"; 7% "largely unsuitable"; and 4% "entirely unsuitable."&lt;ref&gt;There can be no access by an outside observer to the utterances said or heard by the dreamer in the dream. As with all aspects of the dream, including the visual, the experimenter can base his or her findings only on the report given by the dreamer in the waking state. While discussing the obvious problem that subjects may inadvertently be correcting deviances when reporting their dream utterances even immediately after awakening, Heynick (1993), pp.232-234, points out that, unlike the visual and other aspects of dreams, verbal language in dreams has the advantage of easily being reported in the same modality (words) in which it was experienced and of being especially quantifiable.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, in the following dream all lines of dialogue were deemed by all scorers (in the first instance, by four or the five scorers) to be fully suitable to the narrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was sitting in the garden and reading old magazines. [...] My son [...] took a little girlfriend along, also about five, and she started looking through the magazines. And they were getting wet, since she had such a cold that her nose ran. And I said ''that she, your little girlfriend, should rinse her nose with the lotah'', that's a jug used in yoga [instead of a handkerchief]. I use it myself, too. So I let her do it, but because she was so small, it didn't go right, and she started to cry. And then she walked home. So I said to my little boy, ''"I'll go to her mother and tell her what happened, otherwise she'll think 'what a strange lady.'"'' [...] Then that girl came out again, and my son had already told her mother that I had tried to help her get rid of her cold with the lotah. I simply knew that he had said that, but I didn't hear him say that literally. Then I said to that girl ''"In the future, when you catch a cold, you should go to the doctor and have him write out a prescription for medicine."&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.258; as per the protocol, the last utterance ("In the future ... [etc.].") was elicited immediately after awakening; subsequently, the rest of the dream, including the other utterances, was elicited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general, the dreamer as (to continue the film metaphor) "script-writer" appears to have at his or her command not just a "story grammar" capable of generating a reasonably, though not always, coherent  overall scenario, but also the linguistic pragmatic competence to generate verbal dialogue which is usually, though again not always, appropriate to that scenario.

==Theoretical implications for dream models==
The abundance of verbal language in dreams—typically in the form of dialogue between the dreamer and other characters in the dream scenario—which generally shows a syntactic and lexical well-formedness comparable to speech in the waking state, and which in addition is, far more often than not, appropriate to the dream context, has, in Heynick's theoretical analysis, profound consequences for overall dream theories, past and present.

===Psychoanalytic model===
Freud's psychoanalytic model of the mind and, in particular, his theory of dream generation and its function posit the existence of two global modes of mental functioning. The primary process, characterized by such mechanisms as condensations, displacements, and reversals (and the absence of any sense of negation) is theoretically characteristic of the infantile mode of thinking. It is superseded in the course of ontogeny by the development of the conscious part of the mind, which in the older child and adult is governed by the secondary process, adhering to the rules of grammar and logic. The verbal language which the developing child acquires is for Freud by definition a secondary process. The primary process in psychoanalytic theory is however not banished from the mind, but is contained in the unconscious, where  it continues to characterize the mode of functioning of that part of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 12-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The unconscious with its primary process mode—along with its repressed ideational content from early childhood, such as the Oedipus complex—provides, in Freud's theory, the driving force and initial input to dreams. Freud attributed the generation of a more or less coherent dream narrative to the process of "secondary revision," which might (he vacillated on this issue) be "a contribution on the part of waking thought to the construction of dreams" rather than part of the "dream work" proper. The dream-like features which one experiences in dreams, such as condensations, displacements (symbolism), and reversals, are the manifestations of the primary-process input to the dream generation process.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heynick 1981 "Linguistic aspects of  Freud's dream model," ''International Review of Psycho-Analysis'', 8 (3), pp.299-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the dreams of Freud's own and those of his patients, which he provides in ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' and elsewhere, typically abound in verbal dialogue, which is always syntactically well-formed, often complex (containing subordinate clauses) and usually, though not always, semantically well-formed and appropriate to the context of the dream.

As an example, Heynick cites, among others, the "dream of Irma's injection, which Freud himself considered to be of central importance to the development of his dream theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I said to Irma: ''"If you still get pains, it's really your own fault."'' She replied: ''"If you only knew what pains I've got in my throat and stomach and abdomen—it's choking me."'' [...] I at once ''called in'' Dr. M. [who] looked quite different from usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean shaven. [...] My friend Leopold was [...] saying, ''"She has a dull area down on the left."'' He also indicated that a portion of the skin of the left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.) [...] M. said: ''"There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter, dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud 1900/1953 op cit., p.107)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Virtually all the deep personal significance which Freud in his analysis attributed to his Irma dream would be lost without the verbal dialogue. Yet the utterances are fully grammatical; they contain properly embedded and conjoined clauses, two conditional phrases, a future tense, and two instances of negation. All words are proper German (in the original). Semantically most of the dialogue appears appropriate to the overall scenario, except the last which is medically absurd.&lt;ref&gt;While the dialogue in all the dreams Freud presents are syntactically well formed and show a range of syntactic complexity, there are occasional instance of "primary process" interference on the lexical level, as in the case of the neologism (word blend) in the utterance ''"That's the breakfast-ship!"'' in his dream of the castle by the sea. These Freud analyzed, in the same manner as he did slips of the tongue in wakefulness in his ''Psychopathology of Everyday Life'' (1901) for their latent unconscious meanings. Heynick (1993), pp. 19-21, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replay hypothesis====
Freud was apparently confronted with the enigma of how the generation of speech, a secondary process par excellence, could be functioning at such a apparently high level of adequacy during dreaming, the input and motive power of which involves a theoretically primary process. Freud attempted to resolve this problem by introducing his "replay hypothesis" (as Heynick terms it), according to which the dialogue in dreams is merely a repeating, in the same or similar words, of speech actually said or heard by the dreamer recently in waking life, usually on the day before the dream, only slightly modified (if at all) by the above-mentioned process of "secondary revision." This theoretical regression to an infantile mimicking of speech thus denied to the dreaming process proper any substantial language functioning or (in modern terms) linguistic competence.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 28-31; Frank Heynick 1985 "Dream dialogue and retrogression: neurobiological origins of Freud's 'replay hypothesis,'" ''Journal of the History of  the Behavioral Sciences'', 21 (4), pp.321-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a view to testing the validity of Freud's replay hypothesis, the subject-dreamers in the above-mentioned experiment on linguistic competence were asked with regard to each of their dream speech specimens whether they could recall having said the utterance prior to the dream in waking life in the same or similar words. The subjects deemed that to have been the case on the day before the dream for 8% of the utterances and for the week before the dream (including the day before the dream) for 14% of the utterances. Such low figures appear to invalidate Freud's replay hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 235-36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-Freudian revisionism====
Although no neo-Freudians treat the phenomenon of dream speech per se, proposed revisions to the psychoanalytic model of the mind by theorists such as Gill, Holt and Noy,{{who|date=October 2012}} beginning in the late 1960s, variously included the redefining of the place of speech generation (in wakefulness, but this would also apply to speech during dreaming) whereby it would no longer necessarily be classified as a strictly secondary process.&lt;ref&gt;Merton M. Gill 1967 "The primary process," in Robert R, Holt, ed., ''Motives and Thoughts: Psychoanalytic Essays in Honor of David Rapaport''; International Universities Press, pp.260-298; Robert R. Holt 1967 "The development of the primary process: a structural view," ''Psychological Issues'', 5, p.345; Pinchas Noy  1969 "A revision of the psychoanalytic theory of the primary process," ''International Journal of Psycho-Analysis'' 50, pp. 155-178; Pinchas Noy 1979 "The psychoanalytic theory of cognitive development," ''Psychoanalytic Study of the Child'' 34, pp. 169-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such revisions would, Heynick points out, potentially make the phenomenon of verbal language in dreams less anomalous in the psychoanalytic scheme, and without the need to resort, as Freud did, to the replay hypothesis as an "ad hoc" expedient.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.259-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern models of dream generation===

====Activation-synthesis hypothesis====
The [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] of dream generation first proposed by [[Harvard University]] [[psychiatrist]]s [[Allan Hobson|John Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]] in the late 1970s drew upon the discovery earlier in the decade of the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) impulses which during the nightly REM periods (the physiological stage of sleep which is most associated with the phenomenological experience of vivid dreaming) are fired off from the brain stem and travel to the visual areas of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;J. Allan Hobson &amp; Robert McCarley  1977 "The brain as dream-state generator: an activation-synthesis hypothesis," ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 134, pp. 1335-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual area of the cortex, according to the model, the impulses call up largely at random a series of images (=activation). The dreamer's sleeping consciousness automatically tries to integrate these images into a more or less coherent story, while, for example, linking them with fragments of memory from the past (=synthesis). (Similar mechanisms involving the PGO impulses have been incorporated into other dream models, namely [[Francis Crick]] and Graeme Mitchison's [[reverse learning]] theory and Michael Jouvet's endogenous learning hypothesis.)&lt;ref&gt;Francis Crick &amp; Graeme Mitchison 1983 "The function of sleep," ''Nature'' 304, pp.111-114; Michel Jouvet 1999 ''The Paradox of Sleep: The Story of Dreaming'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The activation-synthesis hypothesis, although based on neurological data more advanced than was ever available to Freud, is reminiscent of Freud's psychoanalytic model in that the initial input to the process is primitive and chaotic, onto which some order in imposed by a cognitively more advanced process. But as for the psychological interpretation of dreams the authors of the activation-synthesis hypothesis are outspokenly anti-Freudian, in that in their model the initial input to the dreaming process (the PGO-impulses) are devoid of any depth-psychology significance, Oedipal or whatever. (If the dream acquires any significance relating to the dreamer's personality. history, and present circumstances, this occurs in the manner in which the more or less randomly evoked images are integrated into a story during the synthesis stage, analogous to what a subject may "see" in the random ink-blots of a Rorschach test.)&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 265-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Be this as it may, the activation-synthesis hypothesis with its overwhelming emphasis on visual areas of the cortex is silent as to how the extensive verbal language may be generated and integrated into the dream scenario. Heynick cites as ironic a specimen dream which Hobson presents as exemplary of production by the activation-synthesis model:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am in Willianstown, Massachusetts, talking to a colleague, Van, who is wearing a white shirt (he usually wears blue) open at the neck (he is normally necktied, and even collar-clipped) and khakis (he usually sports flannels). Casual. Van says, as if by the way, ''that he attended the committee meeting that has yesterday considered my candidacy for an invited lecture series.'' (I know from his tone that he is going to deliver bad news.) The committee has decided against it because ''"They don't feel that psychoanalysis should be confronted with laboratory data."
I allowed at how bad this idea was. ''"It's the wrong reason,"'' I said. ''"And their timing is off, because Adolf Grünbaum is just about to publish his important new book in which he insists that that is precisely what psychoanalysis must do."'' Van ignores this statement, appearing never to have heard of A.G.
[...]
We go out a door (which is on the corner of the building) to behold the beautiful Williams campus. A red-brick wall extends down a green lawn to the classic white Puritan buildings.
Van says, ''"They chose Mary"'' (or seems to say that) ''"reflecting their priorities to attract a speaker who might help them with their fund-raising efforts."'' ''"That's why you have such beautiful buildings," I note, "and why there is nothing in them."''&lt;ref&gt;J. Allan Hobson 1988 ''The Dreaming Brain'', Basic Books, pp.232-33; in Heynick (1993), pp. 266-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobson presents this specimen as an example of how dreams can sometimes reflect personal concerns—in this case relating to his academic squabbles with his colleagues due to his anti-psychoanalytic stance within the psychiatric profession. As Heynick points out, the personal significance in this dream is in fact derived almost exclusively from the verbal dialogue, without which the dream would lose all its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoneirics model====
The psychoneirics (from Greek; psycho = mind + oneiros = dream) model of dream generation, formulated by Foulkes from the late 1970s onwards, is cited&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 275-77&lt;/ref&gt;  as an exemplary model (though not necessarily the only possible type of model) of how the generation of verbal language can be incorporated into the generation of the overall dream scenario. Patterned on the psycholinguistic model of speech production (in wakefulness), the psychoneirics model is basically non-neurological. It views dream generation in humans as, like speech in humans, a skillful cognitive act, in fact possibly drawing upon the selfsame cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;David Foulkes  1982 "A cognitive-psychological model of REM dream production," ''Sleep'' 5, pp. 169-187; David Foulkes 1985 ''Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Approach'', Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The input to the dreaming process involves (not unlike the activation-synthesis hypothesis of dreaming) the diffuse activation of memory elements. Psychoneirics focuses on the midrange dream generation processes (regardless of whether or not the dream happens to include verbal dialogue) as involving "schematic selection" and "element activation," analogous to the syntactic frame (sentence structure) selection and word selection of psycholinguistic models. (The dream-like features of dreams, such as condensations (composite images) and anomalous narrative shifts, are seen as residual flux of the dream production mechanism, which is otherwise doing a reasonably good job of developing the initial input into a coherent narrative.) Under this theoretical assumption that the human dream-generation ability and speech-generation ability (in wakefulness) derive from similar cognitive capacities, the psychoneirics model can claim to seamlessly account for the generation of verbal dialogue within dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Foulkes is highly sceptical of the concept that dreams may contain useful information or serve as an adjunct in psychotherapy. Heynick points out that the components and mechanisms of the psychoneiric model, although quite different from the psychoanalytic, are nevertheless not necessarily incompatible with Freudian views on the value of dreams. Frank Heynick 1987, "Review of David Foulkes' ''Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Approach''," ''International Review of Psycho-Analysis'', 14 (2), pp.279-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for psycholinguistics and language psychology==
The data presented in the above experiments is considered as having implications not just for the evaluation of the various existing models of dream generation, but also for models of speech generation in general, that is in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 280-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreaming is a state of consciousness different from the normal wakeful state. With regard to actions within the dream, dreaming consciousness is presumably characterized by a diminished capacity for deliberate intention on the part of the dreamer (including intention of what to say or, as scriptwriter, what to have other characters say) and a diminished attention to, or diminished ability to receive and monitor feedback from, the actions (including speech acts) as they are being carried out in the dream.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of dialogue in dreams indicate that despite the presumed diminished intention, attention and feedback on the part of the dreamer as speaker-listener and scriptwriter, the utterances generated, far more often than not, are semantically and syntactically well-formed and appropriate to the overall scenario. The implication is that the human capacity for language in general (that is, in everyday wakefulness) can largely rely on processes which, once they are triggered when the conditions match those required for their operation, can generate verbal utterances automatically, outside of awareness and without the need for intervention by the speaker except at points where some critical choice is made.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick's analysis of dream speech makes little reference to the neurological concomitants of the psycholinguistic processes operating in the dream state and how their functioning may differ neurologically from wakefulness. Mention is made of the reports by some researchers of a shift of dominant cortical activity in REM sleep to the minor ("right") hemisphere, involved in imagistic and creative thought, and away from the major ("left") hemisphere, known to be responsible for verbal and logical thinking—a shift which, if it indeed occurs, would predict a diminished linguistic capacity in dreaming. Heynick points sooner to the concepts in the Unified Model of sentence generation (Gary Dell &amp; Peter Reich 1980 "Towards a unified model of slips of the tongue," in V.A. Fromkin, ed., ''Errors In Linguistic Performance: Slips of the Tongue, Ear, Pen, and Hand'', Academic Press) and posits that the quasi-neurological "spreading activation" which in wakefulness allows for largely automated sentence generation, with occasional errors due to "leakage," is functioning on a more or less comparable level during dreaming in REM sleep; but that under the peculiar neurological circumstances of the hypnagogic state (when falling asleep) an excessive leakage in the system may tend to produce highly deviant verbal language of the kind Kraepelin reported in his 1906 monograph (Heynick 1993, pp. 228-231)&lt;/ref&gt;
