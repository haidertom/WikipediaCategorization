'''Proposition 227'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |archivedate=2010-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[California ballot proposition]] passed on the June 2, 1998, ballot. Proposition 227 was repealed by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] on November 8, 2016.

According to [[Ballotpedia]], "Proposition 227 changed the way that "Limited English Proficient" (LEP) students are taught in [[California]]. Specifically, it
*Required [[California public schools]] to teach LEP students in special classes that are taught nearly all in English. This provision had the effect of eliminating "bilingual" classes in most cases.
*Shortened the time that most LEP students stayed in special classes.
*Eliminated most programs in the state that provided multi-year special classes to LEP students by requiring that (1) LEP students move from special classes to regular classes when they had acquired a good working knowledge of English and (2) these special classes not normally last longer than one year.
*Required the state government to provide $50 million every year for ten years for English classes for adults who promised to tutor LEP students.&lt;ref&gt;http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_227,_the_%22English_in_Public_Schools%22_Initiative_%281998%29#cite_note-city-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill's intention was to educate [[Limited English proficiency]] students in a rapid, one-year program. It was sponsored by [[Ron Unz]], the runner-up candidate in the 1994 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial primary. The proposition was controversial because of its close proximity to heated political issues including [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], and [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]]. The methods of education enacted by the proposition reflected the electorate's support of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] over [[multiculturalism]]. It passed with a margin of 61% to 39%.

On September 28, 2014, the state legislature passed, and Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed, Senate Bill 1174, which added [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] to the November 2016 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1174 | title=Senate Bill No. 1174, Chapter 753 | work = [[California Legislature]] | accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 58, which repealed most of Proposition 227, passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ulloa |first=Jazmine |title=California will bring back bilingual education as Proposition 58 cruises to victory |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 2016 |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-58-bilingual-1478220414-htmlstory.html |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of bilingual credentials fell after Proposition 227's passage. A [[California Department of Education]] spokesperson anticipated a shortage of bilingual teachers after the passage of Proposition 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Renee |first=Alexa |title=Prop 58: Higher demand for bilingual teachers not helping teacher shortage |work=ABC 10 |location=Sacramento |date=November 9, 2016 |url=http://www.abc10.com/news/local/california/prop-58-higher-demand-for-bilingual-teachers-not-helping-teacher-shortage/350584412 |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=July 2013}}

'''Agency''' is the capacity of an [[Free will|actor]] to act in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503–509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synofzik, M., Vosgerau, G. and Newen, A., 2008. Beyond the comparator model: a multifactorial two-step account of agency. Consciousness and Cognition, 17(1), pp. 219–239.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and [[moral agency]] is therefore a distinct concept. In [[sociology]], an agent is an individual engaging with the [[social structure]]. Notably, though, the primacy of [[structure and agency|social structure vs. individual capacity]] with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] an agent may possess.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/ |title=Action |last1=Wilson |first1=George |last2=Shpall |first2=Samuel |date=4 April 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human agency==
{{See also|Action (philosophy)}}
Agency is contrasted to objects reacting to [[Natural phenomenon|natural forces]] involving only unthinking [[determinism|deterministic]] processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of [[free will]], the [[philosophical]] [[doctrine]] that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. ''How'' humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue.

The capacity of a human to act as an agent is [[person]]al to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular acts of human agency for us and others can then be thought to invest a [[moral]] component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask ''should this have occurred?'' in a way that would be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet [[Shoemaker–Levy]] on [[Jupiter]].

===In philosophy===
The philosophical discipline in charge of studying agency is [[action theory (philosophy)|action theory]]. In certain philosophical traditions (particularly those established by [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]), human agency is a collective, historical dynamic, rather than a function arising out of individual behavior. Hegel's [[Geist]] and Marx's [[universal class]] are [[idealist]] and [[materialist]] expressions of this idea of humans treated as social beings, organized to act in concert. Also look at the debate, philosophically derived in part from the works of [[David Hume|Hume]], between [[determinism]] and [[indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]].

Structure and agency forms an enduring core debate in sociology. Essentially the same as in the [[Marxist]] conception, "agency" refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, based on their will, whereas "structure" refers to those factors (such as social class, but also religion, gender, ethnicity, subculture, etc.) that seem to limit or influence the opportunities that individuals have.

===In other sciences===
Other notions of agency have arisen in the field of economics/management, psychology and social cybernetics:

'''In economics ([[contract theory]])''':

''Economic agency'' is an internal instrumentality through which external influences operate mechanistically on action. Internal agency events are a reflection of the impact of external environments from which causal attributes are ignored, and the self-system is simply a repository and conduit for environmental forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=S. A.|title=The Economic Theory of Agency: The Principal's Problem|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=134–139|jstor=1817064|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In psychology''':

The term of [[Agency (psychology)|agency]] used in different fields of [[psychology]] with different meaning. It can refer to the ability of recognizing agents or attributing agency to objects based on simple perceptual cues or principles, for instance the principle of rationality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Nádasdy|first2=Zoltán|last3=Csibra|first3=Gergely|last4=Bíró|first4=Szilvia|date=1995|title=Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/001002779500661H|journal=Cognition|volume=56|issue=2|pages=165–193|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(95)00661-h|issn=0010-0277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|date=2003|title=Teleological reasoning in infancy: the naı̈ve theory of rational action|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303001281|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=287–292|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00128-1|issn=1364-6613|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that context-sensitive, goal-directed efficient actions are the crucial characteristics of [[Agency (psychology)|agents]]. This topic is thoroughly investigated by [[Developmental psychology|developmental]] and [[Comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]] to understand how an observer is able to differentiate agentive entities from inanimate objects, but it can be also related to the term of autonomous [[Intelligent agent|intelligent agency]] used in [[cybernetics]]. Agency can also imply the [[sense of agency]], that is the feeling of being in control.

''Emergent interactive agency'' defines Bandura's view of agencies, where human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=A.|title=Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=1999|volume=2|pages=21–41|url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1999AJSP.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2016|doi=10.1111/1467-839X.00024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura formulates his view of agency as a [[socio-cognitive]] one, where people are [[self-organizing]], proactive, [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulating]], and engage in [[self-reflection]], and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People have the power to influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one’s thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‘[[Causality|reciprocal causation]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1986). Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ Bormann, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In social cybernetics''':

''Autonomous agency'' is able to embrace the concepts of both the economic agency and the emergent interactive agency. An autonomous system is self-directed, operating in, and being influenced by, interactive environments. It usually has its own immanent dynamics that impact on the way it interacts. It is also adaptable and (hence viable thus having a durable existence), proactive, self-organizing, self-regulating and so forth, participates in creating its own behaviour, and contributes to its life circumstances through cognitive and cultural functionality. Autonomous agency may also be concerned with the relationship between two or more agencies in a mutual relationship with each other and their environments, with imperatives for an agency's behaviour within an interactive context due to immanent emergent attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, K.J., Yolles, M., Fink, G., Iles, P., 2016, The Changing Organisation: Agency Theory in a Cross-cultural Context, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali Ahusan Ihusan''' (born 3 June 1986, [[Male']], [[Maldives]]) is a controversial [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[Journalist]],  a self-employed web designer and the owner of [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] publications; ''Dhiislam Magazine'' and ''Dhiislam Online'' news.

Ali Ahusan Ihusan is considered by many as one of the many Islamic extremist elements who facilitated the coup of 7 February 2011 in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhivehisitee.com/parliament/islamic-extremism-maldives-alive-killing/|title = Islamic extremism in the Maldives: alive and killing - Dhivehi Sitee|date = 2012-10-19|website = Dhivehi Sitee|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for creating one of the promotional websites supporting the mass protest held on 23 December 2011 in Maldives which was supported by many Islamists of the Maldives. This mass protest played an important role in overthrowing President [[Mohamed Nasheed]]'s Government on 7 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC]]|date=7 February 2011|title= Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed resigns amid unrest|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16922570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Minivan News]]|year=2011|title=Protests proceed peacefully as a majority defends Islam]|url=http://minivannews.com/politics/protests-proceed-peacefully-as-a-majority-defends-islam-29826|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128090357/http://minivannews.com/politics/protests-proceed-peacefully-as-a-majority-defends-islam-29826|archive-date=28 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|last=Ahmed|first=F.|date=14 December 2011|title=Police summon protest website developer|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39233|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022211026/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39233|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|date= 23 December 2011|title= LIVE: Maldivians gather in Male for 'religious' protests (archived copy)|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352  |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111204729/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested for 24 hours by [[Maldives Police Service]] after the publication of the website which openly issued death threats to anyone who is against the doctrine of Islam ([[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic Fundamentalism]]) he followed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://english.sun.mv/675|title = Criminal Court orders release of Ahsan and custody of Hilath|website = Sun Online|access-date = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his lawyer, Mohamed Shaheem Ali Saeed, a Maldivian Islamic scholar infamous for his illicit relations with women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/raajje-tv-runs-footage-of-sheikh-shaheem-and-alleges-sex-scandal-30504|title=Raajje TV runs footage of Sheikh Shaheem and alleges sex scandal {{!}} Minivan News – Archive|website=minivannewsarchive.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitated his release.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Maldives Police Service later stated that they wanted to clarify as to who instructed him to develop the website and as to who published the information on it.

'''Altruistic suicide''' is sacrifice of one's life to save or benefit others, for the good of the group, or to preserve the traditions and honor of a society. It is always intentional. '''Benevolent suicide''' refers to the [[self sacrifice]] of one's own life for the sake of the greater good.&lt;ref name="Smedes1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis B. Smedes|title=Mere Morality: What God Expects from Ordinary People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDC-50N-VDwC&amp;pg=PA114|date=9 March 1989|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-0257-6|pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sacrifice may be for the sake of executing a particular action, or for the sake of keeping a natural balance in the society. It is a theme or concept of a custom of [[sacrifice]] typically found within certain types of [[science fiction]] stories. However, real examples of these customs have been recorded to exist among some indigenous people, such as certain [[Inuit]] tribes.  This was seen by [[Émile Durkheim]] in his study ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' as the product of over-integration with society.&lt;ref name="Barry1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert L. Barry|title=Breaking the Thread of Life: On Rational Suicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU4XAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-923-8|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jensen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven J.

In contrast a "sacrifice" committed by force of a [[State (polity)|state]] is instead referred to as [[eugenics]] or [[mass murder]], but may be otherwise referred to as "enforced population limits" or "population control". In literature, examples may promote the concept as a means for ending enduring types of social [[Group conflict|conflict]], or else deride the concept as an example of a [[dystopian]] future society.&lt;ref name="Ket"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rysa Ket|title=ReadOn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mlw8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT223|publisher=Rysa|pages=1–|id=GGKEY:PJG0JH7UBZD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==
If a person ends their life willingly it is not seen as a tragic death. [[Émile Durkheim]] notes that in some cultures there is a duty to intentionally commit ritual suicide.  A Japanese [[Samurai]] intentionally ends life (Seppuku) to preserve [[honor]] and to avoid disgrace. [[India]]n, Japanese, and other [[widows]] sometimes participate in an end of life ritual after the death of a husband, although Westernized populations have abandoned this practice. The elderly members of certain cultures intentionally ended their lives, in what is termed as [[senicide]]. In [[hunter-gatherer]] societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Geronticide: Killing the Elderly
|author=Brogden, Michael |location=London and Philadelphia |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers Ltd.|year=2001|page=57|isbn=1-85302-709-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; death "was determined for the elderly ... normally characterised by a liminal period and ceremonies in which the old person was transferred from the present world to the next." Durkheim also observes that altruistic suicide is unlikely to occur much in contemporary Western society where "individual personality is increasingly freed from the collective personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lecture on Emile Durkheim|url=http://home.ku.edu.tr/~dyukseker/lecture-durkheim2-05.doc|author=Deniz Yükseker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic suicide has been described as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Suicide as an evolutionarily stable strategy|first=Steven |last=Mascaro |author2=Kevin B.

==Emergencies==
In contemporary Western society, this is seldom referred to as [[suicide]], and most often referred to as [[heroism]]. This only exists in times of emergency, and is always lauded, and is perceived as tragic death. Self-sacrificial acts of heroism, such as [[falling on a grenade]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Death by hand grenade: altruistic suicide in combat |first=JA |last=Blake |journal=Suicide &amp; life-threatening behavior |date=Spring 1978 |volume=8 |pages=46–59 |pmid=675772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intentionally remaining on deck of a sinking ship to leave room in the life rafts (for women and children), intentionally ending one's life to preserve the resources (fuel and food) of a group in the face of deprivation and the like are suicidal acts of heroism. [[Firefighters]], law-enforcement individuals, [[undercover agents]], sailors, and [[soldiers]] more often are at risk of opportunities for this form of unplanned self-sacrifice. These are all as a result of tragic, life-threatening, emergencies. It is only an emergency measure, a willing, yet unintentional end to the person's life. It is never as a result of a planned action, yet may involve some planning.

==In popular culture==
* In [[Dan Brown]]'s book ''[[Inferno (Brown novel)|Inferno]]'', Professor [[Robert Langdon]] stumbles upon an article entitled "W.H.O. needs Agathusia" (see above), dealing with the sacrifice that is required of a part of the world's population, in order to ensure the human race's survival in the face of imminent [[resource depletion]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref name="Brown2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Brown|title=Inferno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MV4uCAAAQBAJ|date=14 May 2013|publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In real life the group ''[[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]'' ("VHEMT") does not promote direct suicide but not having any descendant among its affiliates, as an altruistic way to avoid suffering and more damages to thousands of other sentient species and also to millions of unborn human beings. It is a kind of "genetic suicide" (placing an end to the "selfish gene" stigma) in order that persons and animals already living may enjoy better conditions and more natural space.
* "[[Children of the Corn]]", a Stephen King short story in which all the children must offer themselves up to sacrifice when they are 18 years of age.
* ''[[Logan's Run]]'' (1967 novel and 1976 film), in which all are mandated to be terminated upon reaching the age of 21 years (30 in the film). The [[dystopian]] theme is a [[Cold War]] allegory, asserting the nature of the "[[East-West dichotomy|East and West]]" contrast as one of [[totalitarianism]] versus [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], as these manifest as artificial and natural drives, respectively.
* The "LifeDeath" story arc in the [[X-Men]] comic book, describing the practice of a fictional African [[tribe]], in which the village [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]], upon the birth of a new child, allows himself to die for sake of keeping the natural balance found by experience to be necessary for the tribe's survival.
* The [[Isaac Asimov]] novel ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''&amp;mdash;In a distant future, [[Earth]] is [[radioactive]] and all inhabitants are [[euthanasia|euthanized]] at the age of sixty to keep the population under control. A similar idea is present in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Half a Life (TNG episode)|Half a Life]]", where the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] aids a planet where a person must commit ritual [[suicide]] on reaching the age of sixty.
* In [[Sonic Adventure 2]], Shadow the Hedgehog uses up all of his power to prevent the Space Colony ARK from crashing into the Earth, which would destroy all life on the planet, which ultimately makes him fall to the Earth below, (presumably) killing him.
* The ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Childhood's End (Stargate Atlantis)|Childhood's End]]"&amp;mdash;An expedition encounters a colony of humans who perform ritual suicide at the age of 25 in an effort to keep the [[Wraith (Stargate Atlantis)|Wraith]] away. The team learns that, unknown to the colonists, the tradition was created to stabilize the population size so that it could remain within the range of an ancient defense field. Eventually, the team reveals the truth, and improves the field so that the population can age and increase normally.
* In [[Lois Lowry]]'s novel ''[[The Giver]]'', the protagonist is a young boy living in a seemingly utopian future society which suppresses strong emotions. He has been taught that the elderly (and other "unfit" people) are "released" at a certain age to live outside the community, but eventually learns that they actually are being euthanized. This is meant to eradicate grief by making death normal and monotonous, but ends up making people numb to the horror.
* "[[The Lottery]]", a classic American short story by Shirley Jackson, describes the annual forced sacrifice of one resident of a small New England town in order to ensure a good harvest.
* In Japanese anime ''[[Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion]]'', Lelouch Lamperouge sacrifices himself and his life for the greater good by creating himself as the enemy, then being assassinated in front of the world, turning the world's hate for him into wisdom and knowledge. 
* In ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973 film), agathusia is an available and acceptable service provided by government facilities in an overcrowded world. A character in the film takes advantage of this service, which does not appear in [[Make Room! Make Room!|the novel]] on which the film is based.
* In ''[[The Last Olympian]]'' by Rick Riordan, Luke Castellan commits suicide to stop Kronos, the antagonist of the series, from possessing his body. 
*In [[Children of Men]] it is mentioned that that the government provides [[antidepressants]] and a poison calle 'Quietus' to whoever requests it: this is because the whole human poppulation become sterile overnight for no clear reason and so when the current people livinng in the world are the last humans there will ever be and when they die the human specieces would become extincted, causing the collapse of most goverments, with an exception being the [[United Kingdom]] which becpmes a brutal military dictatorship and one of the last nations still standing in Earth; the discovery of a heavily pregnant woman sets in motion the story which has been adapted [[Children of Men|to a critically acclaimed film]] from [[The Children of Men|an critically successful novel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45545">The '''ancient Egyptian units of measurement''' are those used by the [[Egyptian dynasties|dynasties]] of [[ancient Egypt]] prior to its incorporation in the [[Roman Empire]] and general adoption of [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman]], [[Ancient Greek units of measurement|Greek]], and [[Byzantine units of measurement]]. The units of length seem to have originally been [[anthropic units|anthropic]], based on various parts of the [[human body]], although these were standardized using cubit rods, strands of rope, and official measures maintained at some temples.

Following [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia|conquest]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and subsequent death, his [[somatophylakes|bodyguard]] and [[diadochi|successor]] [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] assumed control in [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]], partially reforming its measurements, introducing some new units and hellenized names for others. 

==Length==
[[File:Egyptian circle.png|thumb|Egyptian Circle]]
Egyptian units of length are attested from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]]. Although it dates to the 5th dynasty, the [[Palermo stone]] recorded the level of the [[Nile River]] during the reign of the Early Dynastic [[pharaoh]] [[Djer]], when the height of the Nile was recorded as 6 cubits and 1 palm (about {{convert|3.217|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; A [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd-dynasty]] diagram shows how to construct an elliptical vault using simple measures along an arc. The [[Saqqara ostracon|ostracon depicting this diagram]] was found near the [[Step Pyramid]] of [[Saqqara]]. A curve is divided into five sections and the height of the curve is given in cubits, palms, and digits in each of the sections.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="EG"&gt;{{cite book|last=Englebach|first=Clarke|title=Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture|year=1990|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486264858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, lengths were standardized by [[cubit]] rods. Examples have been found in the tombs of officials, noting lengths up to remen. Royal cubits were used for land measures such as roads and fields. Fourteen rods, including one double-cubit rod, were described and compared by [[Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]].{{sfnp|Lepsius|1865|pp=57 ff}} Two examples are known from the [[Saqqara]] tomb of [[Maya (Egyptian)|Maya]], the treasurer of [[Tutankhamun]]. Another was found in the tomb of Kha ([[TT8]]) in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. These cubits are about {{convert|52.5|cm|sp=us|abbr=on}} long and are divided into palms and hands: each palm is divided into four fingers from left to right and the fingers are further subdivided into ro from right to left. The rules are also divided into hands&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt; so that for example one foot is given as three hands and fifteen fingers and also as four palms and sixteen fingers.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{harvp|Clagett|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardiner|first=Allen|title=Egyptian Grammar 3rd Edition|year=1994|publisher=Griffith Institute|location=Oxford|isbn=0900416351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ME"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faulkner|first=Raymond|title=A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian|publisher=Griffith Institute Asmolean Museum, Oxford|year=1991|isbn=0900416327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MTP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillings|first=Richard|title=Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs|year=1972|publisher=MIT|isbn=0262070456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loprieno|first=Antonio|title=Ancient Egyptian|publisher=CUP|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0521448492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coudée-turin.jpg|thumb|550px|center|Cubit rod from the Turin Museum.]]

Surveying and itinerant measurement were undertaken using rods, poles, and knotted cords of rope. A scene in the tomb of [[Menna]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] shows surveyors measuring a plot of land using rope with knots tied at regular intervals. Similar scenes can be found in the tombs of Amenhotep-Sesi, Khaemhat and Djeserkareseneb. The balls of rope are also shown in [[New Kingdom]] statues of officials such as [[Senenmut]], Amenemhet-Surer, and Penanhor.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;Corinna Rossi, Architecture and Mathematics in Ancient Egypt, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
Records of land area also date to the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]]. The [[Palermo stone]] records grants of land expressed in terms of ''kha'' and ''setat''. Mathematical papyri also include units of land area in their problems. For example, several problems in the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] give the area of rectangular plots of land in terms of ''setat'' and the ratio of the sides and then require the scribe to solve for their exact lengths.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

The ''setat'' was the basic unit of land measure and may originally have varied in size across Egypt's [[Egyptian nome|nome]]s.&lt;ref name=cnm/&gt; Later, it was equal to one square ''khet'', where a ''khet'' measured 100 ''cubits''. The ''setat'' could be divided into strips one ''khet'' long and ten ''cubit'' wide (a ''kha'').&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/weights/area.html Digital Egypt: Measuring area in Ancient Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RMP-80.jpg|thumb|350px|center|Problem 80 on the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]: As for vessels (''debeh'') used in measuring grain by the functionaries of the granary: done into henu, 1 hekat makes 10; 1/2 makes 5; 1/4 makes 2½; etc.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTP"/&gt;]]

Weights were measured in terms of [[Deben (unit)|deben]]. This unit would have been equivalent to 13.6&amp;nbsp;grams in the [[Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]. During the [[New Kingdom]] however it was equivalent to 91&amp;nbsp;grams. For smaller amounts the qedet (1/10 of a deben) and the shematy (1/12 of a deben) were used.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTP"/&gt;

The qedet or kedet is also often known as the ''kite'', from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] form of the same name ({{lang|cop|ⲕⲓⲧⲉ}} or {{lang|cop|ⲕⲓϯ}}).{{sfnp|Weigall|1908|p=ix}} In 19th-century sources, the deben and qedet are often mistakenly transliterated as the ''uten'' and ''kat'' respectively, although this was corrected by the 20th century.{{sfnp|Weigall|1908|pp=iii &amp; ix}}

{{main|Egyptian calendar|Alexandrian calendar}}
The [[flooding of the Nile|former annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] organized [[prehistoric Egypt|prehistoric]] and [[ancient Egypt]] into three [[season]]s: [[Akhet (season)|Akhet]] ("Flood"), [[Peret (season)|Peret]] ("Growth"), and [[Shemu (season)|Shemu]] or Shomu ("Low Water" or "Harvest").&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 39]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Winlock|1940|p=453}}{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA4 4–5]}}

The [[Egyptian civil calendar]] in place by [[Dynasty V]]{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA28 28]}} followed [[regnal era]]s resetting with the ascension of each new [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref name=poormountaineer&gt;{{harvp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the [[solar year]] and apparently initiated during a [[heliacal rising]] of [[Sirius]] following a recognition of its rough correlation with the onset of the Nile flood.{{sfnp|Parker|1950|p=23}} It followed none of these consistently, however. Its year was divided into 3 seasons, [[Egyptian calendar#months|12 months]], 36 [[decans]], or 360 [[day]]s with another 5 [[Egyptian intercalary month|epagomenal days]]{{sfnp|Parker|1950|p=7}}—celebrated as the birthdays of five major gods{{sfnp|Spalinger|1995|p=33}} but feared for their ill luck{{sfnp|Spalinger|1995|p=35}}—added "upon the year". The [[Egyptian months]] were originally simply numbered within each season{{sfnp|Parker|1950|pp=43–5}} but, in later sources, they acquired names from the year's major festivals{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=14–15}} and the three decans of each one were distinguished as "first", "middle", and "last".{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA4 4]}} It has been suggested that during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] and the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] the last two days of each decan were usually treated as a kind of weekend for the royal craftsmen, with royal artisans free from work.{{sfnp|Jauhiainen|2009|p=39}} This scheme lacked any provision for [[leap year]] [[intercalation (calendar)|intercalation]] until the introduction of the [[Alexandrian calendar]] by [[Augustus]] in the 20s{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, causing it to slowly move through the [[Sothic cycle]] against the [[solar year|solar]], [[Sothic year|Sothic]], and [[Julian calendar|Julian years]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Clagett, Ancient Egyptian Science: Calendars, clocks, and astronomy, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Dates were typically given in a [[YMD format]].&lt;ref name=poormountaineer/&gt;

The civil calendar was apparently preceded by an observational [[lunar calendar]] which was eventually made [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]]{{efn|[[Richard Anthony Parker|Parker]] extensively developed the thesis that the predynastic lunar calendar was already [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], using [[intercalary month]]s every 2 or 3 years to maintain [[Sirius (star)|Sirius]]'s [[heliacal rising|return to the night sky]] in its twelfth month,{{sfnp|Parker|1950|pp=30–2}} but no evidence of such intercalation exists predating the schematic lunisolar calendar developed in {{nowrap|4th century {{sc|bc}}.{{sfnp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_10_resolving_the_eponymous_month_conflict.pdf 153]}}}}}} and fixed to the civil calendar, probably in 357{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA26 26]}} The months of these calendars were known as "temple months"{{sfnp|Parker|1950|p=17}} and used for liturgical purposes until the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I#Persecution|closing of Egypt's pagan temples]] under [[Theodosius I]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.12&lt;/ref&gt; in the {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}390s and the [[anti-paganism policies of the early Byzantine Empire|subsequent suppression of individual worship]] by [[list of Byzantine emperors|his successors]].{{sfn|Høyrup|p=13}}

Smaller units of time were vague approximations for most of Egyptian history. Hours—known by a variant of the word for "stars"{{sfnp|Vygus|2015|p=409}}—were initially only demarcated at night and varied in length. They were measured using [[Decans|decan]] stars and by [[water clock]]s. Equal 24-part divisions of the day were only introduced in 127{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Division of these hours into 60 equal [[minute]]s is attested in [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">'''Apparent infection rate''' is an estimate of the rate of progress of a disease, based on proportional measures of the extent of infection at different times.

Firstly, a proportional measure of the extent of infection is chosen as the disease extent metric. For example, the metric might be the proportion of leaf area affected by mildew, or the proportion of plants in a population showing dieback lesions. Measures of disease extent are then taken over time, and a [[mathematical model]] is fit. The model is based upon two assumptions:
* the progress of the infection is constrained by the amount of tissue that remains to be infected; and
* if it were not so constrained, the extent of infection would exhibit [[exponential growth]].

There is a single model parameter&amp;nbsp;''r'', which is the apparent infection rate. It can be calculated analytically using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{t_2-t_1} \log_e \left [ \frac{x_2 (1-x_1)}{x_1 (1-x_2)} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''r'' is the apparent infection rate
:''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the time of the first measurement
:''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the time of the second measurement
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of infection measured at time ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of infection measured at time ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

'''''Archon''''' ({{lang-el|ἄρχων}}, ''árchon'', &lt;small&gt;plural:&lt;/small&gt; ἄρχοντες, ''árchontes'') is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that means "ruler", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning "to rule", derived from the same root as ''[[monarch]]'' and ''[[hierarchy]]''.

==Ancient Greece==
In the early literary period of [[ancient Greece]] the chief [[magistrates]] of various Greek city states were called ''Archon''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging  from "club leader" to "master of the tables" at ''[[syssitia]]'' to "Roman governor".{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In Roman terms, ''archontes'' ruled by ''[[imperium]]'', whereas ''[[Basileus|basileis]]'' ("[[king]]s") had ''[[auctoritas]]''.

In [[Athens]] a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the ''[[Archon Eponymos]]'', the ''[[Polemarch]]'', and the ''Archon [[Basileus]]''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} According to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient [[calendar]] systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as ''[[strategoi]]''. The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by "junior Archons", called ''Thesmothetes''. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

Under the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed [[choregos|choregai]] (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays.  Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus.  The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the ''protagonist''), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the ''archon eponymos''. The ''archon eponymos'' remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

==Byzantine Empire==
[[Byzantine]] historians usually described foreign rulers as ''archontes''.&lt;ref&gt;Aksum: an African civilisation of late antiquity By Stuart C. Munro-Hay  Page 145 {{ISBN|0-7486-0209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of the [[Bulgars]] themselves, along with their [[kanasubigi|own titles]], often bear the title ''archon placed by God'' in inscriptions in Greek.

Inside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]ta'': [[Dalmatia]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. ''Archontes'' were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous [[Slavs|Slavic]]-inhabited areas (''[[sclaviniae]]'') under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, ''archontes'' are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an '''''archontia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχοντία}}).&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{ODB | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the [[mint (facility)|mint]] ({{lang|grc|ἄρχων τῆς χαραγῆς}}), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB | pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of '''''[[megas archon]]''''' ("grand archon") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as "grand prince". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the [[Palaiologan period]], but did not have any specific functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mark C. | last = Bartusis | title = The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204-1453 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-8122-1620-2 | page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople==
From time to time, [[laity]] of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] in communion with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] have been granted the title of ''Archon'' to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]. This ''Archon'' status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .

An Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] (at large).

It is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with [[human rights]] and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.

As it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.

==Other uses==
"Archon" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as ''άρχοντας'' (''archontas)'' to someone that holds a form of status, or power &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slang.gr/lemma/9091-arxontas|title=Άρχοντας - SLANG.gr|author=|date=|website=www.slang.gr|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used within the [[Arabic|Arab]]-speaking [[Copt]]s in church parlance as a [[title]] for a leading member of the [[laity]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Various [[fraternities and sororities]] use the title of archon or variations on it.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Some [[Gnosticism|Gnostic sects]] used this term for [[Archon (Gnosticism)|demons]] associated with the planetspheres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10526">'''Asset-based community development''' ('''ABCD''') is a methodology for the [[sustainable development]] of communities based on their strengths and potentials. It involves assessing the resources, skills, and experience available in a community; organizing the community around issues that move its members into action; and then determining and taking appropriate action.&lt;ref name=NUIPR&gt;{{cite report|last1=McKnight|first1=John|first2=John|last2=Kretzmann|title=Mapping Community Capacity|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/docs/MappingCapacity.pdf|publisher=Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research |location=Evanston, IL |format=PDF |edition=Revised |date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} This method uses the community's own assets and resources as the basis for development; it empowers the people of the community by encouraging them to utilize what they already possess. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathie|first=Alison|last2=Cameron|first2=Jenny|last3=Gibson|first3=Katherine|title=Asset-based and citizen-led development: Using a diffracted power lens to analyze the possibilities and challenges|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464993416674302|journal=Progress in Development Studies|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=54–66|doi=10.1177/1464993416674302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABCD approach was developed by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois.  They co-authored a book in 1993, ''Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing A Community’s Assets'',&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out"/&gt; which outlined their asset-based approach to [[community development]].&lt;ref name="ABCD Institute Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-Based Community Development Institute|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/|publisher=Northwestern University Center for Civic Engagement |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Community Development Program at Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy Research  established the Asset-Based Community Development Institute based on three decades of research and community work by John P. Kretzmann and John L. McKnight.

==Principles==
Whereas needs-based community development emphasizes local deficits and looks to outside agencies for resources, asset-based community development focuses on honing and leveraging existing strengths within the community.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood Transformation"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Stan |last1=Rowland |date=26 April 2008 |title=What is Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) |url=http://www.neighborhoodtransformation.net/pdfs/What_%20is_Asset_Based_Community_Development.pdf |format=PDF |website=Collaborative of Neighborhood Transformation |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Related to tenets of [[empowerment]], it postulates that solutions to community problems already exist within a community’s assets. Principles that guide ABCD include:
* ''Everyone has gifts'': Each person in a community has something to contribute.
* ''Relationships build a community'': People must be connected in order for sustainable community development to take place.
* ''Citizens at the center'': Citizens should be viewed as actors—not recipients—in development.
* ''Leaders involve others'': Community development is strongest when it involves a broad base of community action.
* ''People care'': Challenge notions of "apathy" by listening to people's interests.
* ''Listen'': Decisions should come from conversations where people are heard.
* ''Ask'': Asking for ideas is more sustainable than giving solutions.
* ''Inside-out organization'': Local community members are in control.
* ''Institutions serve the community'': Institutional leaders should create opportunities for community-member involvement, then "step back."&lt;ref name="Neighborhood Transformation"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

== Tools ==
The ABCD approach utilizes several tools to assess and mobilize communities.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kretzmann|first1=John|last2=McKnight|first2=John|title=Building Communities From the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets|date=1993|publisher=ACTA Publications|location=Chicago, IL|page=14|edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-87946-108-9 |oclc=36708153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity inventory===

# ''Skills Information'': lists the many skills that a person has gained at home, work, in the community, or elsewhere.  Examples of these skills can include internet knowledge, hair'''-'''cutting, listening, wallpapering, carpentry, sewing, babysitting, etc.&lt;ref name="The Abundant Community"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKnight|first1=John|last2=Block|first2=Peter|author2-link=Peter Block|title=The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods|date=2010|publisher=Berrett-Koehler|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=1st |isbn=978-1-60509-584-4 |oclc=876604904}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Community Skills'': lists the community work in which a person has participated to determine future work they may be interested in.
# ''Enterprising Interests and Experience'': lists past experience in business and determines interest in starting a business.
# ''Personal Information'': lists minimum information for follow-up.

===Asset mapping===
There are five key assets in any given community: individuals, associations, institutions, physical assets, and connections.&lt;ref name="What is ABCD Toolkit"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Asset-based community development (ABCD)|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/docs/What%20isAssetBasedCommunityDevelopment(1)(3).pdf|website=ABCD Institute|publisher=Collaborative for Neighborhood Transformation|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These assets are broken down into three categories: Gifts of individuals, Citizens’ Associations, and Local Institutions.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt;   Asset maps are used in lieu of needs maps which focus solely on negative aspects of communities.  Asset maps, on the other hand, focus on community assets, abilities, skills, and strengths in order to build its future.

[[File:Asset map.svg|Example asset map]]

===Time banks===
[[Time banks]] are an example of using community assets to connect individuals' assets to one another.&lt;ref name=TimeBanks&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Timebanking? |url=http://timebanks.org/what-is-timebanking/ |website=TimeBanks |publisher=TimeBanks USA |accessdate=22 February 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221100136/http://timebanks.org/what-is-timebanking/ |archive-date=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors and local organizations share skills with one another and earn and spend ‘TimeBank Hours’ or ‘credits’ in the process, allowing an hour of child care to equal an hour of home repair or tax preparation.&lt;ref name=TimeBanks/&gt;

Since ABCD relies on existing community assets to create change, it has been criticized for implying that disadvantaged communities have all the resources they need to solve community problems.&lt;ref name="Australian Social Work"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ennis|first1=G.|last2=West|first2=Deborah|title=Exploring the potential of social network analysis in asset-based community development practice and research|journal=Australian Social Work|date=2010|volume=64|issue=4|pages=404–417|doi=10.1080/0312407X.2010.508167}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ABCD Institute, however, ABCD methodology recognizes that systemic injustice may require disadvantaged communities to seek assistance from outside the community. ABCD maintains that interventions from exterior sources will be most effective when a community’s assets are leveraged at full capacity.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt;
ABCD is described as a more sustainable model of community development than needs-based community development, because needs-based approaches may perpetuate community problems by emphasizing deficiencies and the necessity for reliance on outside assistance. By contrast, ABCD aims to build capacity within communities by expanding their [[social capital]].&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt; By working with outside resources and simultaneously building trust within the community, more members can make use of a wider array of strengths.&lt;ref name="Development in Practice"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathie|first1=Alison|last2=Cunningham|first2=Gord|title=From clients to citizens: Asset-based Community Development as a strategy for community-driven development|journal=Development in Practice|date=2003|volume=13|issue=5|pages=474-486|doi=10.1080/0961452032000125857}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|480}}

The '''''Assisted Human Reproduction Act''''' (the ''Act'') is law enacted by the Parliament of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'', S.C. 2004, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to regulate assisted human reproduction (AHR) and related research.  It is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation in the world concerning reproductive technologies and related research. It was introduced and passed in 2004 and was fully in force by 2007.

The ''Act'' was meant to provide Canadians with a system of [[licensing]], [[surveillance|monitoring]], [[inspection]] and [[enforcement]] of activities relating to AHR in order to protect and promote Canadians' health, safety and values. It identifies prohibited activities, as well as controlled activities, which are AHR activities that can be performed in Canada but require a licence and adherence to the regulations.&lt;ref name="Paterson2014"&gt;Stephanie Paterson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LZHdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 Fertile Ground: Exploring Reproduction in Canada]''. MQUP; June 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-9212-4}}. p. 164–.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2010 Supreme Court case that ruled that certain sections of the Act exceeded the federal government's legislative power means that the scope of the Act's regulatory framework was significantly reduced (see below).

==Constitutional validity==

{{main|Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act}}

On December 22, 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared some sections of the ''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'' unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.org/en/2010/2010scc61/2010scc61.html Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2010 SCC 61] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104204506/http://scc.lexum.org/en/2010/2010scc61/2010scc61.html |date=2011-11-04 }}, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 457&lt;/ref&gt; It was ruled that the sections listed below exceeded the [[Canadian federalism|legislative jurisdiction]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'':

* 10,11,13: Certain provisions regarding controlled activities
* 14-18: Certain provisions regarding privacy and access to information
* 40(2), 40(3), 40(3.1), 40(4), 40(5), 44(2), 44(3): Certain provisions regarding administration

===Prohibited activities===
Prohibited activities, defined in sections 5 to 9 of the ''Act'', are AHR activities that Parliament has determined to be ethically unacceptable or incompatible with Canadian values, or to pose significant risks to the health, safety and values of Canadians. These activities are not allowed in Canada. Prohibitions include:
*Creating an ''in vitro'' embryo for any purpose other than creating a human being or improving or providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures
*Human cloning.
*Pre-selecting or increasing the probability that an embryo will be a particular sex (except to prevent a sex-linked genetic condition).
*Transplanting a sperm, egg, embryo or foetus of a non-human life form into a human being, or using a sperm, egg, or ''in vitro'' embryo that was transplanted into a non-human life form to create a human being
*Creating a hybrid for the purpose of reproduction, or transplanting a hybrid into a human being or non-human life form
*Creating a chimera for any purpose, or transplanting a chimera into a human being or non-human life form
*Using gametes or ''in vitro'' embryos without the consent of the donor of the gametes or embryo
*Obtaining gametes from a person under 18 years of age (except for own use preservation purposes)
*Paying, offering to pay, or advertising payment for sperm, eggs or ''in vitro'' embryos from donors or for the services of surrogate mothers (including payment to a third party for arranging for the services of a surrogate mother)

This last prohibition prevents the "commercialization" of human reproduction in Canada. While the ''Act'' currently allows donors and surrogate mothers to be reimbursed for legitimate expenses, [[Health Canada]] is developing specific regulations about what constitutes a legitimate expenditure.

===Controlled activities===
Controlled activities, set out in sections 10 to 12 of the ''Act'', are AHR activities permitted if performed in accordance with regulations and by a licensed clinic or individual in licensed premises. However, section 10, which addressed the "use of human reproductive material," and section 11, which addressed "transgenics," were ruled ''ultra vires''. Section 12, which addresses the "reimbursement of expenditures" for providing gametes and surrogacy services, is ''intra vires'' but is not yet in force.

=== Starch-based plastics ===
[[Thermoplastic]] starch currently represents the most widely used bioplastic, constituting about 50 percent of the bioplastics market{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. Simple starch bioplastic can be made at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Potato-Plastic!/ Make Potato Plastic!]. Instructables.com (2007-07-26). Retrieved on 2011-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pure starch is able to absorb [[humidity]], and is thus a suitable material for the production of drug capsules by the pharmaceutical sector. Flexibiliser and [[plasticiser]] such as [[sorbitol]] and [[glycerine]] can also be added so the starch can also be processed thermo-plastically. The characteristics of the resulting bioplastic (also called "thermo-plastical starch") can be tailored to specific needs by adjusting the amounts of these additives.

Starch-based bioplastics are often blended with biodegradable polyesters to produce starch/polylactic acid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khalid|first1=Saud|last2=Yu|first2=Long|last3=Meng|first3=Linghan|last4=Liu|first4=Hongsheng|last5=Ali|first5=Amjad|last6=Chen|first6=Ling|title=Poly(lactic acid)/starch composites: Effect of microstructure and morphology of starch granules on performance|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.45504/abstract|website=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|accessdate=25 July 2017|pages=n/a–n/a|language=en|doi=10.1002/app.45504|volume=134|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; starch/[[polycaprolactone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bioplasticsonline.net/2010/06/starch-based-bioplastic-manufacturers-and-suppliers/ | title=Starch based Bioplastic Manufacturers and Suppliers | work=bioplasticsonline.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814061041/http://bioplasticsonline.net/2010/06/starch-based-bioplastic-manufacturers-and-suppliers/ | archivedate=August 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or starch/Ecoflex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archive-date=2012-07-13 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713125533/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8106328/Enhancing-biopolymers-additives-are-needed.html | url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8106328/Enhancing-biopolymers-additives-are-needed.html | title=Enhancing biopolymers: additives are needed for toughness, heat resistance &amp; processability.(biopolymers)(Cover story) | work=goliath.ecnext.com | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate produced by BASF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BASF announces major bioplastics production expansion|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2008/04/22/basf-announces-major-bioplastics-production-expansion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  blends. These blends are used for industrial applications and are also compostable. Other producers, such as Roquette, have
developed other starch/[[polyolefin]] blends. These blends are not biodegradable, but have a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-based plastics used for the same applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roquette, nouvel acteur sur le marché des plastiques, lance GAÏALENE® : une gamme innovante de plastique végétal|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2010/10/16/roquette-nouvel-acteur-sur-le-marche-des-plastiques-lance-gaialene%C2%AE-une-gamme-innovante-de-plastique-vegetal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the origin of its raw material, starch is cheap, abundant, and renewable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation|last=Avérous|first=Luc|title=Nanobiocomposites Based on Plasticized Starch|date=2014|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53730-0.00028-2|work=Starch Polymers|pages=211–239|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444537300|access-date=2018-09-26|last2=Pollet|first2=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch based plastics are complex blends of starch with compostable plastics such as Polylactic acid, Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate, Polybutylene Succinate, Polycaprolactone, and Polyhydroxyalkanoates. These complex blends improve water resistance as well as processing and mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Starch-based films (mostly used for packaging purposes) are made mainly from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters to form biodegradable and compostable products. These films are seen specifically in consumer goods packaging of magazine wrappings and bubble films. In food packaging, these films are seen as bakery or fruit and vegetable bags. Composting bags with this films are used in selective collecting of organic waste.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Further, a new starch-based film was developed by Agricultural Research Service scientists can even be used as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repl.2016.09.002 | title=Collaboration delivers better results | date=January 2017 | last=Cate | first=Peter | journal=Reinforced Plastics | volume=61 | issue=1 | pages=51–54 | issn=0034-3617 | doi=10.1016/j.repl.2016.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellulose-based plastics ===
[[File:Bio-K Blister CG.jpg|thumb|A packaging blister made from [[cellulose acetate]], a bioplastic]]

[[Cellulose]] bioplastics are mainly the [[cellulose ester]]s, (including [[cellulose acetate]] and [[nitrocellulose]]) and their derivatives, including [[celluloid]].

Cellulose can become thermoplastic when extensively modified. An example of this is cellulose acetate, which is expensive and therefore rarely used for packaging. However, cellulosic fibers added to starches can improve mechanical properties, permeability to gas, and water resistance due to being less hydrophilic than starch.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A group at Shanghai University was able to construct a novel green plastic based on cellulose through a method called hot pressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Na|last2=Hou|first2=Xingshuang|last3=Chen|first3=Li|last4=Cui|first4=Siqi|last5=Shi|first5=Liyi|last6=Ding|first6=Peng|date=2017-05-16|title=A Green Plastic Constructed from Cellulose and Functionalized Graphene with High Thermal Conductivity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b02675|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=9|issue=21|pages=17914–17922|doi=10.1021/acsami.7b02675|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protein-based plastics ===
Bioplastics can be made from proteins from different sources. For example, wheat gluten and casein show promising properties as a raw material for different biodegradable polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=J. H.|last2=Murphy|first2=R. J.|last3=Narayan|first3=R.|last4=Davies|first4=G. B. H.|date=2009-07-27|title=Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1526/2127|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=364|issue=1526|pages=2127–2139|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0289|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2873018|pmid=19528060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, soy protein is being considered as another source of bioplastic. Soy proteins have been used in plastic production for over one hundred years. For example, body panels of an original Ford automobile were made of soy-based plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1941-9635.2008.tb00292.x | title=The History of Tomorrow's Materials: Protein-Based Biopolymers | date=February 2008 | last=Ralston | first=Brian E. | last2=Osswald | first2=Tim A. | journal=Plastics Engineering | volume=64 | issue=2 | pages=36–40 | issn=0091-9578 | doi=10.1002/j.1941-9635.2008.tb00292.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are difficulties with using soy protein-based plastics due to their water sensitivity and relatively high cost. Therefore, producing blends of soy protein with some already-available biodegradable polyesters improves the water sensitivity and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bm050888p | title=Morphology and Properties of Soy Protein and Polylactide Blends | date=May 2006 | last=Zhang | first=Jinwen | last2=Jiang | first2=Long | last3=Zhu | first3=Linyong | last4=Jane | first4=Jay-lin | last5=Mungara | first5=Perminus | journal=Biomacromolecules | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=1551–1561 | issn=1525-7797 | doi=10.1021/bm050888p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some aliphatic polyesters ===
The aliphatic bio[[polyester]]s are mainly [[polyhydroxyalkanoate]]s (PHAs) like the [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]] (PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) and polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH).

==== Polylactic acid (PLA) ====
[[File:Mulch Film made of PLA-Blend Bio-Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Mulch film made of [[polylactic acid]] (PLA)-blend bio-flex]]

[[Polylactic acid]] (PLA) is a [[transparent plastic]] produced from [[corn]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/plastic.html|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[dextrose]]. Superficially, it is similar to conventional petrochemical-based mass plastics like [[Polystyrene|PS]].  It has the distinct advantage of degrading to nontoxic products.   Unfortunately it exhibits inferior impact strength, thermal robustness, and barrier properties (blocking air transport across the membrane).&lt;ref name=Ullmanns/&gt;  PLA and PLA blends generally come in the form of granulates with various properties, and are used in the plastic processing industry for the production of films, fibers, plastic containers, cups and bottles.
PLA is also the most common type of plastic [[Fiber|filament]] used for home [[fused deposition modeling]].

==== Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate ====
The [[biopolymer]] poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a [[polyester]] produced by certain bacteria processing glucose, corn starch&lt;ref name="bioplastic-innovation.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirel: PHAs grades for Rigid Sheet and Thermoforming|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/06/08/mirel-phas-grades-for-rigid-sheet-and-thermoforming/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or wastewater.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Micromidas is using carefully constructed populations of bacteria to convert organic waste into bio-degradable plastics. |url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/07/29/micromidas-is-using-carefully-constructed-populations-of-bacteria-to-convert-organic-waste-into-bio-degradable-plastics/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023230713/http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/07/29/micromidas-is-using-carefully-constructed-populations-of-bacteria-to-convert-organic-waste-into-bio-degradable-plastics/ |archivedate=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its characteristics are similar to those of the petroplastic [[polypropylene]]. PHB production is increasing. The [[South America]]n [[sugar]] industry, for example, has decided to expand PHB production to an industrial scale. PHB is distinguished primarily by its physical characteristics. It can be processed into a transparent film with a melting point higher than 130 degrees Celsius, and is biodegradable without residue.

=== Polyhydroxyalkanoates  ===
[[Polyhydroxyalkanoates]] are linear [[polyester]]s produced in nature by [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] or [[lipid]]s. They are produced by the bacteria to store carbon and energy. In industrial production, the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions for the fermentation of sugar. More than 150 different [[monomer]]s can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties. PHA is more ductile and less elastic than other plastics, and it is also biodegradable. These plastics are being widely used in the medical industry.

=== Polyamide 11 ===
[[Polyamide 11|PA 11]] is a [[biopolymer]] derived from natural oil. It is also known under the tradename Rilsan B, commercialized by [[Arkema]]. PA 11 belongs to the technical polymers family and is not biodegradable. Its properties are similar to those of [[Polyamide 12|PA 12]], although emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption of nonrenewable resources are reduced during its production. Its thermal resistance is also superior to that of PA 12. It is used in high-performance applications like automotive fuel lines, pneumatic airbrake tubing, electrical cable antitermite sheathing, flexible oil and gas pipes, control fluid umbilicals, sports shoes, electronic device components, and catheters.

A similar plastic is Polyamide 410 (PA 410), derived 70% from castor oil, under the trade name EcoPaXX, commercialized by DSM.&lt;ref name="EcoPaXX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/cworld/public/media/pages/press-releases/19_10_dsm_launches_bio_based_performance_materials_for_automotive_industry.jsp|title=Home|work=dsm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PA 410 is a high-performance polyamide that combines the benefits of a high melting point (approx. 250&amp;nbsp;°C), low moisture absorption and excellent resistance to various chemical substances.

=== Bio-derived polyethylene ===
{{Main|Renewable Polyethylene}}

The basic building block ([[monomer]]) of [[polyethylene]] is ethylene. Ethylene is chemically similar to, and can be derived from ethanol, which can be produced by fermentation of agricultural feedstocks such as sugar cane or corn. Bio-derived polyethylene is chemically and physically identical to traditional polyethylene&amp;nbsp;– it does not biodegrade but can be recycled. The Brazilian chemicals group [[Braskem]] claims that using its method of producing polyethylene from sugar cane ethanol captures (removes from the environment) 2.15 tonnes of {{CO2}} per tonne of Green Polyethylene produced.

=== Genetically modified bioplastics ===
[[Genetic modification]] (GM) is also a challenge for the bioplastics industry. None of the currently available bioplastics&amp;nbsp;– which can be considered first generation products&amp;nbsp;– require the use of GM crops, although GM corn is the standard feedstock.

Looking further ahead, some of the second generation bioplastics manufacturing technologies under development employ the "plant factory" model, using [[genetically modified crops]] or [[genetically modified bacterium|genetically modified bacteria]] to optimise efficiency.

===Polyhydroxyurethanes ===

Recently, there have been a large emphasis on producing biobased and isocyanate-free polyurethanes. One such example utilizes a spontaneous reaction between polyamines and cyclic carbonates to produce polyhydroxurethanes.&lt;ref name="From Petrochemical Polyurethanes to Biobased Polyhydroxyurethanes"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Nohra  | first = Bassam  |author2=Laure Candy |author3=Jean-Francois Blanco |author4=Celine Guerin |author5=Yann Raoul |author6=Zephirin Mouloungui  | year = 2013 | title = From Petrochemical Polyurethanes to Biobased Polyhydroxyurethanes | journal = Macromolecules | volume =  46| issue =  | doi =10.1021/ma400197c | pages=3771–3792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional cross-linked polyurethanes, cross-linked polyhydroxyurethanes have been shown to be capable of recycling and reprocessing through dynamic transcarbamoylation reactions.&lt;ref name="Mechanically Activated, Catalyst-Free Polyhydroxyurethane Vitrimers"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Fortman  | first = David J.  |author2=Jacob P.

Materials such as starch, cellulose, wood, sugar and biomass are used as a substitute for fossil fuel resources to produce bioplastics; this makes the production of bioplastics a more sustainable activity compared to conventional plastic production.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"&gt;Gironi, F., and Vincenzo Piemonte. “Bioplastics and Petroleum-Based Plastics: Strengths and Weaknesses.” Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, vol. 33, no. 21, 2011, pp. 1949–59, doi:10.1080/15567030903436830.&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental impact of bioplastics is often debated, as there are many different metrics for "greenness" (e.g., water use, energy use, deforestation, biodegradation, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Madeleine R., and Claire Y. Barlow. “Life Cycle Assessments of Biodegradable, Commercial Biopolymers - A Critical Review.” Resources, Conservation and Recycling, vol. 78, Elsevier B.V., 2013, pp. 54–66, doi:10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.06.010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence bioplastic environmental impacts are categorized into nonrenewable energy use, climate change, eutrophication and acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"&gt;Weiss, Martin, et al. “A Review of the Environmental Impacts of Biobased Materials.” Journal of Industrial Ecology, vol. 16, no. SUPPL.1, 2012, doi:10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00468.x.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioplastic production significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and decreases non-renewable energy consumption.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Firms worldwide would also be able to increase the environmental sustainability of their products by using bioplastics &lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus, Sebastian, et al. “A Crossroads for Bioplastics: Exploring Product Developers’ Challenges to Move beyond Petroleum-Based Plastics.” Journal of Cleaner Production, vol. 127, Elsevier Ltd, 2016, pp. 84–95, doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.003.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although bioplastics save more nonrenewable energy than conventional plastics and emit less GHG compared to conventional plastics, bioplastics also have negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication and acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Bioplastics induce higher eutrophication potentials than conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Biomass production during industrial farming practices causes nitrate and phosphate to filtrate into water bodies; this causes eutrophication which is the richness of the nutrients in body waters.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Eutrophication is a threat to water resources around the world since it kills aquatic organisms, creates dead zones and causes harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, E., et al. “Eutrophication Will Increase during the 21st Century as a Result of Precipitation Changes.” Science, vol. 357, no. July, 2017, pp. 405–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioplastics also increase acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; The high increase in eutrophication and acidification caused by bioplastics is also caused by the using chemical fertilizer in the cultivation of renewable raw materials to produce bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt;

Other environmental impacts of bioplastics include exerting lower human and terrestrial ecotoxicity and carcinogenic potentials compared to conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; However, bioplastics exert higher aquatic ecotoxicity than conventional materials.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Bioplastics and other bio-based materials increase stratospheric ozone depletion compared to conventional plastics; this is a result of nitrous oxide emissions during fertilizer application during industrial farming for biomass production.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Artificial fertilizer increase nitrous oxide emissions especially when the crop does not need all the nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas, Francisco, et al. “Nitrous Oxide Emission Reductions from Cutting Excessive Nitrogen Fertilizer Applications.” Climatic Change, vol. 132, no. 2, 2015, pp. 353–67, doi:10.1007/s10584-015-1426-y.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor environmental impacts of bioplastics include toxicity through using pesticides on the crops used to make bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Bioplastics also cause carbon dioxide emissions from harvesting vehicles.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Other minor environmental impacts include high water consumption for biomass cultivation, soil erosion, soil carbon losses and loss of biodiversity, and they are mainly are a result of land use associated with bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Land use for bioplastics production leads to lost carbon sequestration and increases the carbon costs while diverting land from its existing uses &lt;ref&gt;Gironi, F., and Vincenzo Piemonte. “Land-Use Change Emissions: How Green Are the Bioplastics?” Environmental Progress &amp; Sustainable Energy, vol. 30, no. 4, 2010, pp. 685–691, doi:10.1002/ep.10518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bioplastics are extremely advantageous because they reduce non-renewable consumption and GHG emissions, they also negatively affect the environment through land and water consumption, using pesticide and fertilizer, eutrophication and acidification; hence one’s preference for either bioplastics or conventional plastics depends on what one considers the most important environmental impact.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt;

=== Biodegradation of Bioplastics ===
{{further|Biodegradable plastic}}
[[File:Air Pillow made of PLA-Blend Bio-Flex.jpg|thumb|upright|Packaging air pillow made of PLA-blend bio-flex]]

[[File:Teebeutel Polylactid 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Tea bag]]s made of polylactide (PLA), (peppermint tea)]]While plastics based on organic materials were manufactured by chemical companies throughout the 20th century, the first company solely focused on bioplastics- Marlborough Biopolymers- was founded in 1983. However, Marlborough and other ventures that followed failed to find commercial success, with the first such company to secure long-term financial success being the Italian company Novamont, founded in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bioplasticsnews.com/2018/07/05/history-of-bioplastics/|title=The History and Most Important Innovations of Bioplastics|last=Barrett|first=Axel|date=5 September 2018|website=Bioplastics News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expense and time requirements of researching and testing new bio-based and biodegradable polymers have placed bioplastics at a commercial disadvantage compared to petrochemical-based plastics. Bioplastics remain less than one percent of all plastics manufactured worldwide,&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1941-9635.2016.tb01489.x | title=Ready to Grow: The Biodegradable Polymers Market | date=March 2016 | journal=Plastics Engineering | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=1–4 | issn=0091-9578 | doi=10.1002/j.1941-9635.2016.tb01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until very recently have been an average of 2-4 times more expensive to manufacture than petrochemical plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darby|first=Debra|date=August 2012|title=Bioplastics Industry Report|url=|journal=BioCycle|volume=53|issue=8|pages=40–44|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bioplastics do not yet save more carbon emissions than are required to manufacture them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rujnić-Sokele|first=Maja|last2=Pilipović|first2=Ana|date=September 2017|title=Challenges and Opportunities of Biodegradable Plastics: A Mini Review|url=|journal=Waste Management and Research|volume=35|issue=2|pages=132–140|doi=10.1177/0734242x16683272|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the cost of research, bioplastics lack the versatility of application that petrochemical plastics possess, with many conventional plastics having no bio-based equivalent that can match their quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pathak|first=Swathi|date=December 2014|title=Bioplastic: Its Timeline Based Scenario &amp; Challenges|url=|journal=Journal of Polymer and Biopolymer Physics Chemistry|publisher=SciEP|volume=2|issue=4|pages=84–90|doi=10.12691/jpbpc-2-4-5|via=SciePub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the industry faces logistical problems around both material sources and waste disposal infrastructure. As most bioplastics are produced from plant sugars, starches, or oils, it is estimated that replacing 250 million tons of the plastic manufactured each year with bio-based plastics would require 100 million hectares of land, or 7 percent of the arable land on Earth. And when bioplastics reach the end of their life cycle, those designed to be compostable and marketed as biodegradable are often sent to landfills due to the lack of proper composting facilities or waste sorting, where they then release methane as they break down anaerobically.&lt;ref&gt;Dolfen, Julia. “Bioplastics- Opportunities and Challenges.” US Composting Council. 2012 Compostable Plastics Symposium, Jan. 2012, Austin, Texas, https://compostingcouncil.org/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Dolfen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the bioplastics industry has grown by 20-30% a year. BCC Research forecast that the global market for biodegradable polymers would grow at a compound average growth rate of more than 17 percent through 2012, and this rate of growth has actually been exceeded. Bio-based plastics are predicted to make up 5% of all manufactured plastics in 2020, and 40% of all manufactured plastics in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/bioplastics-industry|title=Bioplastics Market Analysis, Market Size, Application Analysis, Regional Outlook, Competitive Strategies And Forecasts, 2016 To 2024|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Market Research Results &amp; Consulting|publisher=Grand View Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceresana predicts that when bioplastics reach 5% of the plastics market in 2020, the market for bio-based plastics will be worth 5.8 billion dollars, three times the size of the bioplastics market in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/bioplastics/ Market Study Bioplastics, 3rd edition].

Retrieved on 2014-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest demand for bioplastics has been in packaging, driven by widespread concern over the use of petrochemical plastics in disposable, one-use products that are then sequestered in landfills or the natural environment. Packaging continues to provide 60% of the market for bioplastic, and to account for the largest share of growth in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plasticstoday.com/packaging/global-market-bioplastics-grow-20/203039009457893|title=Global Market for Bioplastics to Grow by 20%|last=|first=|date=29 November 2017|website=PlasticsToday|publisher=UBM Americas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a shift in the market for an increased demand of bioplastics, especially for sustainable packaging.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; This has been seen specifically in Western Europe, which accounted for more than 45% of the global biodegradable plastics demand in 2014. This demand from consumers for more sustainable options was also seen in recent policies; Italy has banned the use of petroleum-based plastic bags, and there is a tax on use of petroleum based plastic bags in Germany &lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

However, the industry in biobased polymers has not grown as rapidly as some have predicted. The NNFCC predicted that the industry would exceed 2.1 million tonnes produced each year by 2013,&lt;ref name="NNFCC" /&gt; but by in 2017, only 2.05 million tonnes of bioplastic were produced in that year.

This includes a lack of any regulation on the amount of sustainably sourced material in a product required for it to be marketed as a bioplastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lampinen|first=Johanna|date=2010|title=Trends in Bioplastics and Biocomposites|url=|journal=VTT Research Notes|publisher=VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland|volume=2558|pages=12–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that, according to Market and Market, the global biodegradable plastics market is just beginning and only accounts for less than 1% of the overall plastics market &lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;[[File:Sharpener made from Cellulose Acetate Biograde.JPG|thumb|175px|Prism [[pencil sharpener]] made from cellulose acetate biograde]]

=== Industrial compostability – EN 13432, ASTM D6400 ===
The [[European Norm|EN]] 13432 industrial standard is arguably the most international in scope. This standard must be met in order to claim that a plastic product is compostable in the European marketplace. In summary, it requires biodegradation of 90% of the materials in a lab within 90 days. The [[ASTM]] 6400 standard is the regulatory framework for the United States and sets a less stringent threshold of 60% biodegradation within 180 days for non-homopolymers, and 90% biodegradation of homopolymers within industrial composting conditions (temperatures at or above 140F). Municipal compost facilities do not see above 130F.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Many [[starch]]-based plastics, PLA-based plastics and certain [[aliphatic]]-[[aromatic]] co-[[polyester]] compounds, such as [[succinates]] and [[adipates]], have obtained these certificates. Additive-based bioplastics sold as photodegradable or [[Oxo Biodegradable]] do not comply with these standards in their current form.

=== Compostability – ASTM D6002 ===
The ASTM D 6002 method for determining the compostability of a plastic defined the word ''[[compost]]able'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm|title=Compostable.info|work=compostable.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Original research|section|date=September 2015}}
This definition drew much criticism because, contrary to the way the word is traditionally defined, it completely divorces the process of "composting" from the necessity of it leading to [[humus]]/compost as the end product. The only criterion this standard ''does'' describe is that a compostable plastic must '''look''' to be going away as fast as something else one has already established to be compostable under the ''traditional'' definition.

==== Withdrawal of ASTM D 6002 ====
In January 2011, the ASTM withdrew standard ASTM D 6002, which had provided plastic manufacturers with the legal credibility to label a plastic as [[compostable]]. Its description is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This guide covered suggested criteria, procedures, and a general approach to establish the compostability of environmentally degradable plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6002.htm|title=ASTM D6002 - 96(2002)e1 Standard Guide for Assessing the Compostability of Environmentally Degradable Plastics (Withdrawn 2011)|work=astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ASTM has yet to replace this standard.

=== Biobased – ASTM D6866 ===
The ASTM D6866 method has been developed to certify the biologically derived content of bioplastics. Cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere mean that some of the carbon is the radioactive isotope [[carbon-14]]. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere is used by plants in [[photosynthesis]], so new plant material will contain both carbon-14 and [[carbon-12]]. Under the right conditions, and over geological timescales, the remains of living organisms can be transformed into [[fossil fuels]]. After ~100,000 years all the carbon-14 present in the original organic material will have undergone radioactive decay leaving only carbon-12. A product made from [[biomass]] will have a relatively high level of carbon-14, while a product made from petrochemicals will have no carbon-14. The percentage of renewable carbon in a material (solid or liquid) can be measured with an accelerator [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6866.htm |title=ASTM D6866 - 11 Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis |publisher=Astm.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-16-understanding-bio-based-content |title=NNFCC Newsletter&amp;nbsp;– Issue 16. Understanding Bio-based Content&amp;nbsp;— NNFCC |publisher=Nnfcc.co.uk |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an important difference between biodegradability and biobased content. A bioplastic such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braskem.com.br/site/portal_braskem/en/sala_de_imprensa/sala_de_imprensa_detalhes_6062.aspx |title=Braskem |publisher=Braskem |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be 100% biobased (i.e. contain 100% renewable carbon), yet be non-biodegradable. These bioplastics such as HDPE nonetheless play an important role in greenhouse gas abatement, particularly when they are combusted for energy production. The biobased component of these bioplastics is considered carbon-neutral since their origin is from biomass.

=== Anaerobic biodegradability – ASTM D5511-02 and ASTM D5526 ===
The ASTM D5511-12 and ASTM D5526-12 are testing methods that comply with international standards such as the ISO DIS 15985 for the biodegradability of plastic.

{{Economics sidebar}}

'''Blue economy''' is a term in [[economics]] relating to the exploitation and preservation of the marine environment. Its scope of interpretation varies among organizations.

==Definitions==
According to the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Blue Economy?|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/infographic/2017/06/06/blue-economy|website=THE WORLD BANK|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the blue economy is the "sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem."

[[European Commission]] defines it as "All economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. It covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=The 2018 Annual Economic Report on EU Blue Economy|url=https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-annual-economic-report-on-blue-economy_en.pdf|journal=European Union|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] considers it "an emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or 'blue' resources."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/blue-economy|title=Blue economy {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation International]] adds that "blue economy also includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values and biodiversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.conservation.org/2018/03/what-on-earth-is-the-blue-economy/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwl9zdBRDgARIsAL5Nyn3xGXHsApcgFjjO6CvN0Zg602NYYuJw2LPvqa_nDpKKxPtNDJWQxLYaAvSLEALw_wcB|title=What on Earth is the ‘blue economy’? – Human Nature - Conservation...|last=Bertazzo|first=Sophie|date=2018-03-07|work=Human Nature – Conservation International Blog|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for the Blue Economy]] says "it is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/center-blue-economy/about/history|title=Our History and Methodology|website=Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World Wildlife Fund]] begins its report&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/15_1471_blue_economy_6_pages_final.pdf|title=Principles for a Sustainable BLUE ECONOMY|last=|first=|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|year=|isbn=|location=|page=2|pages=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Principles for a Sustainable BLUE ECONOMY'' with two senses given to this term: "For some, blue economy means the use of the sea and its resources for sustainable economic development. For others, it simply refers to any economic activity in the maritime sector, whether sustainable or not."

As the WWF reveals in its purpose of the report, there is still no widely accepted definition of the term blue economy despite increasing high-level adoption of it as a concept and as a goal of policy-making and investment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Related terms ==

=== Ocean economy ===
A related term of blue economy is ocean economy and we see some organizations using the two terms interchangeably. However, these two terms represent different concepts. Ocean economy simply deals with the use of ocean resources and is strictly aimed at empowering the economic system of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.examrace.com/Current-Affairs/NEWS-Blue-Economy-Versus-Ocean-Economy.htm|title=Blue Economy versus Ocean Economy- Translation in Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Sindhi, Sindhi, Tamil, Telgu - Examrace|last=Examrace|website=www.examrace.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue economy goes beyond viewing the ocean economy solely as a mechanism for economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It focuses on the sustainability of ocean for economic growth. Therefore, blue economy encompasses ecological aspects of the ocean along with economic aspects.

=== Green economy ===
The [[green economy]] is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with [[ecological economics]]. Therefore, blue economy is a part of green economy.  During Rio+20 Summit in June 2012, Pacific small island developing states stated that, for them, "a green economy was in fact a blue economy".&lt;ref name="Really"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/homepage.cfm?249111/What-a-blue-economy-really-is|title=What a 'blue economy' really is – WWF’s perspective|date=10 July 2015|website=WWF|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue growth ===
A related term is blue growth, which means "support to the growth of the maritime sector in a sustainable way."&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=BLUE GROWTH|url=http://ec.europa.eu/assets/mare/infographics/|website=Mare|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is adopted by the European Union as an integrated maritime policy to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/blue_growth_en|title=Blue growth - Maritime Affairs - European Commission|last=Anonymous|date=2016-09-28|website=Maritime Affairs - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential==
On top of the traditional ocean activities such as fisheries, tourism and maritime transport, blue economy entails emerging industries including renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed extractive activities and marine biotechnology and bioprospecting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Potential of the Blue Economy : Increasing Long-term Benefits of the Sustainable Use of Marine Resources for Small Island Developing States and Coastal Least Developed Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26843/115545.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=World Bank|volume=|pages=ix|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue economy also attempts to embrace ocean ecosystem services that are not captured by the market but provide significant contribution to economic and human activity. They include carbon sequestration, coastal protection, waste disposal, and the existence of biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The 2015 WWF briefing puts the value of key ocean assets over US$24 trillion.&lt;ref name="Really" /&gt; Fisheries are now overexploited, but there is still plenty of room for aquaculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fujita|first1=Rod|title=FAO Reports 87% of the World’s Fisheries are Overexploited or Fully Exploited|url=http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/07/11/fao-reports-87-of-the-worlds-fisheries-are-overexploited-or-fully-exploited/|website=FAO|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offshore wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind EUROPE|last2=BVGassociates|title=Unleashing Europe’s offshore wind potential|date=June 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium|page=16|url=https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/Unleashing-Europes-offshore-wind-potential.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector with the supply of 58 percent of fish to global markets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aquaculture is vital to food security of the poorest countries especially. Only in the [[European Union]] the blue economy employed 3,362,510 people in 2014.&lt;ref name="Commission" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
The World Bank specifies three challenges that limit the potential to develop a blue economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Current economic trends that have been rapidly degrading ocean resources.
# The lack of investment in human capital for employment and development in innovative blue economy sectors.
# Inadequate care for marine resources and ecosystem services of the oceans.

The '''Bristol Bus Boycott''' of 1963 arose from the refusal of the [[Bristol Omnibus Company]] to employ Black or Asian bus crews in the city of [[Bristol]], [[England]], [[UK]]. In common with other British cities at the time, there was widespread racial discrimination in housing and employment at that time against "Coloureds". Led by youth worker [[Paul Stephenson (civil rights campaigner)|Paul Stephenson]] and the West Indian Development Council, the [[boycott]] of the company's buses by Bristolians lasted for four months until the company backed down and overturned their discriminative [[colour bar]] policy.

The boycott drew national attention to racial discrimination in Britain, and the campaign was supported by national politicians, with interventions being made by church groups and the [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] for [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The Bristol Bus Boycott was considered by some to have been influential in the passing of the [[Race Relations Act 1965]] which made "racial discrimination unlawful in public places" and the [[Race Relations Act 1968]], which extended the provisions to employment and housing.

==Background==
[[Bristol]] in the early-1960s had an estimated 3,000 residents of [[West Indian]] origin, some of who had served in the [[British military]] during [[World War II]] and some who had emigrated to the UK more recently. A large number lived in the area around City Road in [[St Pauls, Bristol|St Pauls]]. They suffered [[discrimination]] in housing and employment, and some encountered violence from [[Teddy Boy]] gangs of [[White British]] youths.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; This community set up their own churches and associations, including the West Indian Association, which began to act as a representative body.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 12"&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their foremost grievances was the colour bar operated by the Bristol Omnibus Company, which had been a [[Nationalization|nationalised]] company owned by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] since 1950, and operated through the [[Transport Holding Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel 1989, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was a reported labour shortage on the buses, Black prospective employees were refused employment offers as bus crews, although they were employed in lower paid positions in workshops and in canteens. The ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'' and the ''[[Western Daily Press]]'' both ran series on the colour bar, which was blamed by company management on the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU), which represented bus workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Local union officials denied that there was any colour bar, but in 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that "coloured" workers should not be employed as bus crews. Andrew Hake, curator of the Bristol Industrial Mission, recalled that: "The TGWU in the city had said that if one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop."&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 12" /&gt;

The bus workers' concern, apart from [[racism]], was that a new competitive source of labour could reduce their earnings. Pay was low and workers relied on overtime to get a good wage. One [[shop steward]] said, "people were fearful of an influx of people from elsewhere (on the grounds it) would be reducing their earnings potential."&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dispute==

===Boycott===
Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, formed an action group, later to be called the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of progress in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and [[Boys' Brigade]] officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the refusal of [[Rosa Parks]] to give up her seat on a bus in [[Alabama]] and the ensuing [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] in the [[United States]] in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;

Their action was announced at a press conference on 29 April 1963. The following day, they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many White people supported them.&lt;ref name="BEP630430"&gt;{{cite news|title=W. Indians claim 100 p.c. support for bus boycott|last=Staff writer|date=30 April 1963|work=Bristol Evening Post|publisher=Bristol United Press|location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'' pointed out that the TGWU opposed the [[apartheid]]  system in South Africa and asked what trade union leaders were doing to counteract racism in their own ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a white man in London to admit it, but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... I understand that in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T8277175859&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T8277175862&amp;cisb=22_T8277175861&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=169745&amp;docNo=1|title=Paul Stephenson|subscription=yes|work=Bristol Evening Post, archived at [[LexisNexis]]|location=Bristol|date=6 July 2005|publisher=Bristol United Press|accessdate=11 January 2010|last=Staff writer}}

Students from [[Bristol University]] held a protest march to the bus station and the local headquarters of the TGWU on 1 May, which attracted heckling from bus crews as they passed through the city centre, according to the local press. Local [[MPs#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Tony Benn]] contacted then [[Leader of the Opposition|Labour Opposition leader]] [[Harold Wilson]], who spoke out against the colour bar at an [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] rally in London.&lt;ref name=Dresserp26&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 May, local [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Alderman#In the United Kingdom|Alderman]] Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the colour bar. On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the [[History of local government in Bristol|city council]] threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Benn, [[Fenner Brockway]] and former cricketer [[Learie Constantine]] also condemned the bus company.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 21–28"&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 21–28&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was then serving as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] for [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Constantine wrote letters to the bus company and Stephenson and spoke out against the colour bar to reporters when he attended the cricket match between the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] at the [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|County Ground]], which took place from 4 to 7 May.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The West Indies team refused to publicly support the boycott, saying that sport and politics did not mix. During the game, local members of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (CARD) distributed leaflets urging spectators to support the action.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 21–28"/&gt;

The local branch of the TGWU refused to meet with a delegation from the West Indian Development Council, and an increasingly bitter war of words was fought out in the local media. Ron Nethercott, South West Regional Secretary of the union, persuaded a local black TGWU member, Bill Smith, to sign a statement which called for quiet negotiation to solve the dispute. It condemned Stephenson for causing potential harm to the city's Black and Asian population.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 21–28"/&gt; Nethercott launched an attack on Stephenson in the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' newspaper, calling him dishonest and irresponsible. This led to a libel case in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], which awarded Stephenson damages and costs in December 1963.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bristol Council of Churches launched a mediation attempt, saying

&lt;blockquote&gt;We seriously regret that what may prove an extended racial conflict arising from this issue has apparently been deliberately created by a small group of West Indians professing to be representative. We also deplore the apparent fact that social and economic fears on the part of some white people should have placed the Bristol Bus Company in a position where it is most difficult to fulfil the Christian ideal of race relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This in turn was criticised by Robert Davison, an official at the [[Jamaica]]n [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commission]], who stated that it was "nonsense to describe a group of West Indians as unrepresentative when no representative West Indian body existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] rally, held on Sunday 6 May in [[Eastville, Bristol|Eastville]], local [[Labour council|Trades Council]] members publicly criticised the TGWU. On the same day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to [[St Mary Redcliffe]] church, but there was a poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 29-32"&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the ''Bristol Evening Post'' had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.

===Resolution===
The union, the city Labour establishment and the [[Bishop of Bristol]], [[Oliver Stratford Tomkins]], ignored Stephenson and tried to work with Bill Smith of the TGWU to resolve the dispute. Learie Constantine continued with his support for the campaign, meeting with the [[Lord Mayor]] of Bristol and [[Frank Cousins]], leader of the Transport and General Workers Union. In addition, he went to the Bristol Omnibus Company's parent, the [[Transport Holding Company]], and persuaded them to send officials to talk with the union. The company chairman told Constantine that racial discrimination was not company policy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Negotiations between the bus company and the union continued for several months until a mass meeting of 500 bus workers agreed on 27 August to end the colour bar. On 28 August 1963, Ian Patey announced that there would be no more discrimination in employing bus crews.&lt;ref name=Dresser42-47&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bus firm drops colour bar|last=Western Daily Press Reporter|date=29 August 1963|work=Western Daily Press|publisher=Bristol United Press|location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the same day that [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] made his famous "I Have a Dream" speech at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]]. On 17 September, Raghbir Singh, a [[Sikh]], became Bristol's first non-White bus conductor. A few days later two [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] and two [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] men joined him.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1965, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] passed a [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]], which made "racial discrimination unlawful in public places."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Unite the Union|Unite]], the successor to the Transport and General Workers Union, issued an apology in February 2013. Laurence Faircloth, the union's South West secretary said of the union's stance at the time, "It was completely unacceptable. I can well accept the sense of injustice and pain that has been felt because [of] what happened in Bristol all those years ago."&lt;ref name=BBC05&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Union apology after 1960s Bristol buses race row|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-21574799|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition ===
In 2009, Stephenson was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE), for his part in organising the bus boycott. Bailey and Hackett were also awarded OBEs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23795655 What was behind the Bristol bus boycott?], ''BBC News'', 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8692">The '''comments section''' is a feature of online [[Blog|blogs]] and [[news websites]] in which the publishers invite the audience to comment on the published content.

== History ==
The first online website to offer a comments section was [[Open Diary]], which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/magazine/no-comments.html|title=No Comments|last=Erard|first=Michael|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of blog posts on the site were able to post public or private comments to the blog authors directly on the page. The history of comment sections on news articles started in 1998 with ''[[Rocky Mountain News|The Rocky Mountain News]]'', they were one of the first newspapers to add online same page comments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen and Pain|first=Gina Masullo and Paromita|date=2017|title=Normalizing Online Comments|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=11|issue=7|pages=876–892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While today comment sections are common, at first newspapers were hesitant to add them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallsten, Kevin, and Tarsi|first=|date=2016|title=PERSUASION FROM BELOW?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2015.1102607|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1019–1040|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s Comments sections were rapidly added to news sites, between 2007 and 2008 there was a 42% growth in the number of top circulating news sites with comments sections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2008 75% of the top 100 most circulated newspapers had comments sections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2010 ''The American Journalism Review'' stated that news sites should not have anonymous comments sections.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following that statement ''[[Reuters]], [[ESPN]], [[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]], [[Popular Science]], [[Sporting News]], and [[USA Today]]'' either made comments gated or removed them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The following are examples of some news websites that have disabled comments:

*[[Vice Media]] closed its comment section in 2016.&lt;ref name="Smith 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/halo-vicecom-kini-menghapus-kolom-komentar|title=We're Getting Rid of Comments on VICE.com|last1=Smith|first1=Jonathan|date=20 December 2016|website=Vice|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|language=en-us|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On closing, they noted "we had to ban countless commenters over the years for threatening our writers and subjects, doxxing private citizens, and engaging in hate speech against pretty much every group imaginable."&lt;ref name="Smith 2016" /&gt;
*[[NPR]] closed its comment section in 2016.&lt;ref name="Jensen 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/08/17/489516952/npr-website-to-get-rid-of-comments|title=NPR Website To Get Rid Of Comments|last1=Jensen|first1=Elizabeth|date=17 August 2016|website=NPR.org|language=en|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the stated reasons for this was that "commenters were behaving inappropriately and harassing other commenters".&lt;ref name="Jensen 2016" /&gt;
*[[IMDB]] closed its comment section (the discussion boards, not the user reviews section) in 2017. On closing, one journalist noted that the comments section on that website was "notoriously known for hosting some of the most pointless and hateful commentary around".&lt;ref name="Perez 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/03/one-of-the-worst-comments-sections-on-the-internet-is-shutting-down/|title=One of the worst comments sections on the internet is shutting down|last1=Perez|first1=Sarah|date=3 February 2017|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of comment sections, gated and non-gated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verticalmeasures.com|title=Digital Marketing Agency: PPC, SEO &amp; Content Services – Vertical Measures|website=www.verticalmeasures.com|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gated comments sections require users to give the website some information before they can post a comment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many news websites such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and most social media websites are gated, as users have to log in and post under a username that identifies them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.proxyau.wrlc.org/docview/1823607220?accountid=8285|title=Trolls Under the Bridge: Anonymous online comments and gatekeeping in the digital realm|last=Steele|first=Noelle|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Non-gated comment sections don’t require users to provide information before posting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This lack of a barrier to entry can allow more people to post and potentially lead to a discussion with more viewpoints covered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This anonymity, however, is believed by some to lead to uncivil behavior and a higher likelihood of seeing or experiencing verbal aggression in the comments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In response to this, both the Illinois and New York State senates have considered bills to limit non-gated comment sections.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Illinois bill would have incentivized websites to gate their comments requiring users to provide their real name, a home address and a confirmed IP address.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The New York Bill would have made websites remove anonymous commenting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Toxic comments and moderation ==
Toxic comments refer to rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comments that are likely to make one leave a discussion. 

If a comment section is moderated it is typically done in any one of the three ways: post-moderation, pre-moderation, or through a flagging system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comments that are post-moderated are checked after they’ve been posted. Pre-moderated comments are checked before they are made publicly visible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comments that are moderated with a flagging system can be marked or ‘flagged’ by other users for official website moderators to look at.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In February 2017, [[Google]]-founded technology incubator [[Jigsaw (company)|Jigsaw]] unveiled a tool based on [[artificial intelligence]], called [[Perspective API]], to identify toxic comments in online forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/technology/google-jigsaw-monitor-toxic-online-comments.html|title=Google Cousin Develops Technology to Flag Toxic Online Comments|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [[Disqus]], a company that provides a comment-hosting services, analysed over 92 million comments written by 2 million people over 16 months, on about 7,000 forums that used its service, and concluded that 25% of all commenters made at least one toxic comment. The study was carried out using Google's Perspective API. In the United States, the time of the day at which maximum proportion of comments were toxic, was 3 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/08/internet-troll-map/|title=Trolls Across America: Mapping the Most and Least Troll-Ridden Places in the U.S.|last=Bénichou|first=Lo|date=|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Engadget]]'' denounced the underlying API bringing attention to its discriminatory classifications - phrases like "I am a gay black woman" were scored as 87% toxic. It described the algorithm as "sexist, racist and ableist". 

Good moderation of news websites is expensive.&lt;ref name="Wang 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Shan|title=When are comments sections of news sites worth keeping alive?

'''Composition over inheritance''' (or '''composite reuse principle''') in [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) is the principle that classes should achieve [[Polymorphism_(computer_science)|polymorphic]] behavior and [[code reuse]] by their [[object composition|composition]] (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] from a base or parent class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an often-stated principle of OOP, such as in the influential book ''[[Design Patterns]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-63361-2 | title = [[Design Patterns|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]] | last1 = Gamma | first1 = Erich | authorlink1 = Erich Gamma | last2 = Helm | first2 = Richard | last3 = Johnson | first3 = Ralph | authorlink3 = Ralph Johnson (computer scientist) | last4 = Vlissides | first4 = John | authorlink4 = John Vlissides | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]  | page = 20  | oclc = 31171684 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics==
An implementation of composition over inheritance typically begins with the creation of various [[Interface (computing)#Software interfaces in object-oriented languages|interfaces]] representing the behaviors that the system must exhibit. The use of interfaces allows this technique to support the [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] behavior that is so valuable in object-oriented programming. Classes implementing the identified interfaces are built and added to [[business domain]] classes as needed. Thus, system behaviors are realized without inheritance. 

In fact, business domain classes may all be base classes without any inheritance at all. Alternative implementation of system behaviors is accomplished by providing another class that implements the desired behavior interface. Any business domain class that contains a reference to the interface can easily support any implementation of that interface and the choice can even be delayed until run time.

==Example==

===Inheritance===
An example in [[C++11]] follows:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
class GameObject {
    public:
        virtual ~GameObject() {}
        virtual void update() {}
        virtual void draw() {}
        virtual void collide(GameObject objects[]) {}
};

class Visible : public GameObject {
    public:
        void draw() override { /* draw model at position of this object */ };
    private:
        Model* model;
};

class Solid : public GameObject {
    public:
        void collide(GameObject objects[]) override { /* check and react to collisions with objects */ };
};

class Movable : public GameObject {
    public:
        void update() override { /* update position */ };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, we have concrete classes:

* class &lt;code&gt;Player&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt;
* class &lt;code&gt;Cloud&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;
* class &lt;code&gt;Building&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt;
* class &lt;code&gt;Trap&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;, but neither &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt;

Note that multiple inheritance is dangerous if not implemented carefully, as it can lead to the [[diamond problem]]. One solution to avoid this is to create classes such as &lt;code&gt;VisibleAndSolid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VisibleAndMovable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VisibleAndSolidAndMovable&lt;/code&gt;, etc. for every needed combination, though this leads to a large amount of repetitive code. Keep in mind that C++ solves the diamond problem of multiple inheritance by allowing [[virtual inheritance]].

=== Composition and interfaces ===
The following C# example demonstrates the principle of using composition and interfaces to achieve code reuse and polymorphism.

&lt;source lang="CSharp"&gt;
class Program {
    static void Main() {
        var player = new Player();
        player.Update();
        player.Collide();
        player.Draw();
    }
}

interface IVisible {
    void Draw();
}

class Invisible : IVisible {
    public void Draw() {
        Console.Write("I won't appear.");
    }
}

class Visible : IVisible {
    public void Draw() {
        Console.Write("I'm showing myself.");
    }
}

interface ICollidable {
    void Collide();
}

class Solid : ICollidable {
    public void Collide() {
        Console.Write("Bang!");
    }
}

class NotSolid : ICollidable {
    public void Collide() {
        Console.Write("Splash!");
    }
}

interface IUpdatable {
    void Update();
}

class Movable : IUpdatable {
    public void Update() {
        Console.Write("Moving forward.");
    }
}

class NotMovable : IUpdatable {
    public void Update() {
        Console.Write("I'm staying put.");
    }
}

abstract class GameObject : IVisible, IUpdatable, ICollidable {
    private readonly IVisible _v;
    private readonly IUpdatable _u;
    private readonly ICollidable _c;

    public GameObject(IVisible visible, IUpdatable updatable, ICollidable collidable) {
        _v = visible;
        _u = updatable;
        _c = collidable;
    }

    public void Update() {
        _u.Update();
    }

    public void Draw() {
        _v.Draw();
    }

    public void Collide() {
        _c.Collide();
    }
}

class Player : GameObject {
    public Player() : base(new Visible(), new Movable(), new Solid()) { }
}

class Cloud : GameObject {
    public Cloud() : base(new Visible(), new Movable(), new NotSolid()) { }
}

class Building : GameObject {
    public Building() : base(new Visible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid()) { }
}

class Trap : GameObject {
    public Trap() : base(new Invisible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid()) { }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Benefits==
To favor composition over inheritance is a design principle that gives the design higher flexibility. It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree. For example, a gas pedal and a wheel share very few common traits, yet are both vital components in a car. What they can do and how they can be used to benefit the car is easily defined. Composition also provides a more stable business domain in the long term as it is less prone to the quirks of the family members. In other words, it is better to compose what an object can do (''[[HAS-A]]'') than extend what it is (''[[IS-A]]'').&lt;ref name=FHDPs&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial design is simplified by identifying system object behaviors in separate interfaces instead of creating a hierarchical relationship to distribute behaviors among business-domain classes via inheritance. This approach more easily accommodates future requirements changes that would otherwise require a complete restructuring of business-domain classes in the inheritance model. Additionally, it avoids problems often associated with relatively minor changes to an inheritance-based model that includes several generations of classes.

Some languages, notably [[Go (programming language)|Go]], use type composition exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |last1=Pike |first1=Rob |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2016-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
One common drawback of using composition instead of inheritance is that methods being provided by individual components may have to be implemented in the derived type, even if they are only [[Forwarding (object-oriented programming)|forwarding methods]]. In contrast, inheritance does not require all of the base class's methods to be re-implemented within the derived class. Rather, the derived class only needs to implement (override) the methods having different behavior than the base class methods. This can require significantly less programming effort if the base class contains many methods providing default behavior and only a few of them need to be overridden within the derived class.

For example, in the C# code below, the variables and methods of the {{code|Employee}} base class are inherited by the {{code|HourlyEmployee}} and {{code|SalariedEmployee}} derived subclasses. Only the {{code|Pay()}} method needs to be implemented (specialized) by each derived subclass. The other methods are implemented by the base class itself, and are shared by all of its derived subclasses; they do not need to be re-implemented (overridden) or even mentioned in the subclass definitions.

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
// Base class
public abstract class Employee
{
    // Properties
    protected string  Name        { get; set; }
    protected int     ID          { get; set; }
    protected decimal PayRate     { get; set; }
    protected int     HoursWorked { get; }

    // Get pay for the current pay period
    abstract public decimal Pay();
}

// Derived subclass
public class HourlyEmployee: Employee
{
    // Get pay for the current pay period
    override public decimal Pay()
    {
        // Time worked is in hours
        return HoursWorked * PayRate;
    }
}

// Derived subclass
public class SalariedEmployee: Employee
{
    // Get pay for the current pay period
    override public decimal Pay()
    {
        // Pay rate is annual salary instead of hourly rate
        return HoursWorked * PayRate/2087;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This drawback can be avoided by using [[Traits (computer science)|traits]], [[mixin]]s, or [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]] extensions. Some languages, such as [[Perl 6]], provide a &lt;code&gt;handles&lt;/code&gt; keyword to facilitate method forwarding. In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [http://projectlombok.org/ Project Lombok] allows delegation to be implemented using a single @Delegate annotation on the field, instead of copying and maintaining the names and types of all the methods from the delegated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projectlombok.org/features/Delegate.html | title=@Delegate | website=Project Lombok | access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], extensions can be used to define a default implementation of a protocol on the protocol itself, rather than within an individual type's implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html | title=Protocols | website=The Swift Programming Language | publisher=Apple Inc | access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] the delegation pattern has been included into the language syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html | title=Delegated Properties | website=Kotlin Reference | publisher=JetBrains | access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical studies==
A 2013 study of 93 open source Java programs (of varying size) found that:

{{quote|While there is not huge [sic] opportunity to replace inheritance with composition (...), the opportunity is significant (median of 2% of uses [of inheritance] are only internal reuse, and a further 22% are only external or internal reuse).

Our results suggest there is no need for concern regarding abuse of inheritance (at least in open-source Java software), but they do highlight the question regarding use of composition versus inheritance. If there are significant costs associated with using inheritance when composition could be used, then our results suggest there is some cause for concern.|Tempero ''et al.'', "What programmers do with inheritance in Java"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Tempero |first1=Ewan |first2=Hong Yul |last2=Yang |first3=James |last3=Noble |title=What programmers do with inheritance in Java |conference=ECOOP 2013–Object-Oriented Programming |year= 2013 |pages=577–601 |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~ewan/qualitas/studies/inheritance/TemperoYangNobleECOOP2013-pre.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99546">{{short description|Tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses}}
'''Confirmation bias''', also called '''confirmatory bias''' or '''myside bias''',&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[David Perkins (geneticist)|David Perkins]], a professor and researcher at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, coined the term "myside bias" referring to a preference for "my" side of an issue {{Harv |Baron|2000|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Plous | first=Scott | title=The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making | page=233 | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and a systematic error of [[inductive reasoning]]. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [[bias]]ed way. The effect is stronger for [[emotion]]ally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.  Confirmation bias is a variation of the more general tendency of [[apophenia]].

People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

A series of [[Experimental psychology|psychological experiments]] in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include [[wishful thinking]] and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way. However, even scientists can be prone to confirmation bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Lee|first1=C. J.|last2=Sugimoto|first2=C. R.|last3=Zhang|first3=G.|last4=Cronin|first4=B.|year=2013|title=Bias in peer review|journal=J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec|volume=64|pages=2–17|doi=10.1002/asi.22784}}&lt;br/&gt;*{{Citation|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=1|issue=3|pages=229–238|title=Psychology of the Scientist: An Analysis of Problem-Solving Bias|first1=Michael J.|last1=Mahoney|first2=B.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirmation biases contribute to [[overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor [[decision making|decisions]] due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.&lt;ref name=cbiaspolitics&gt;{{Citation|last=Nickerson|first=Raymond S.|title=Confirmation Bias: A Ubiquitous Phenomenon in Many Guises|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=175–220|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara W. Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1984). ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam''. New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Confirmation biases are effects in [[Information processing theory|information processing]]. They differ from what is sometimes called the ''[[Behavioral confirmation|behavioral confirmation effect]]'', commonly known as ''[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]'', in which a person's expectations influence their own behavior, bringing about the expected result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists restrict the term ''confirmation bias'' to selective collection of evidence that supports what one already believes while ignoring or rejecting evidence that supports a different conclusion. Others apply the term more broadly to the tendency to preserve one's existing beliefs when searching for evidence, interpreting it, or recalling it from memory.&lt;ref name="risen"&gt;{{Harvnb|Risen|Gilovich|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;"Assimilation bias" is another term used for biased interpretation of evidence. {{Harv|Risen|Gilovich|2007|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fred Barnard07.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A drawing of a man sitting on a stool at a writing desk|Confirmation bias has been described as an internal "[[Wikt:yes man|yes man]]", echoing back a person's beliefs like [[Charles Dickens]]' character [[Uriah Heep]]&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{Citation |title=How to Ignore the Yes-Man in Your Head |first=Jason |last=Zweig |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |date= November 19, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703811604574533680037778184 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Experiments have found repeatedly that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, by searching for evidence consistent with their current hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kunda112" /&gt; Rather than searching through all the relevant evidence, they phrase questions to receive an affirmative answer that supports their theory.&lt;ref name="baron162" /&gt; They look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis were true, rather than what would happen if they were false.&lt;ref name="baron162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000 |pp=162–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone using yes/no questions to find a number they suspect to be the number 3 might ask, "Is it an [[odd number]]?" People prefer this type of question, called a "positive test", even when a negative test such as "Is it an even number?" would yield exactly the same information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kida|2006|pp=162–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not mean that people seek tests that guarantee a positive answer. In studies where subjects could select either such pseudo-tests or genuinely diagnostic ones, they favored the genuinely diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Devine |first=Patricia G. |first2=Edward R. |last2=Hirt |first3=Elizabeth M. |last3=Gehrke |year=1990 |title=Diagnostic and confirmation strategies in trait hypothesis testing |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=952–63 |issn=1939-1315 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Trope |first=Yaacov |first2=Miriam |last2=Bassok |year=1982 |title=Confirmatory and diagnosing strategies in social information gathering |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=22–34 |issn=1939-1315 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preference for positive tests in itself is not a bias, since positive tests can be highly informative.&lt;ref name="klaymanha" /&gt; However, in combination with other effects, this strategy can confirm existing beliefs or assumptions, independently of whether they are true.&lt;ref name="oswald82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real-world situations, evidence is often complex and mixed. For example, various contradictory ideas about someone could each be supported by concentrating on one aspect of his or her behavior.&lt;ref name="kunda112" /&gt; Thus any search for evidence in favor of a hypothesis is likely to succeed.&lt;ref name=oswald82 /&gt; One illustration of this is the way the phrasing of a question can significantly change the answer.&lt;ref name="kunda112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=112–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people who are asked, "Are you happy with your social life?" report greater satisfaction than those asked, "Are you ''un''happy with your social life?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kunda |first=Ziva |first2=G.T. |last2 =Fong |first3=R. |last3=Sanitoso |first4=E. |last4=Reber |year=1993 |title=Directional questions direct self-conceptions |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |publisher=Society of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=29 |pages=62–63 |issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1006/jesp.1993.1004 }} via {{Harvnb|Fine|2006|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a small change in a question's wording can affect how people search through available information, and hence the conclusions they reach. This was shown using a fictional child custody case.&lt;ref name="shafir" /&gt; Participants read that Parent A was moderately suitable to be the guardian in multiple ways. Parent B had a mix of salient positive and negative qualities: a close relationship with the child but a job that would take them away for long periods of time. When asked, "Which parent should have custody of the child?" the majority of participants chose Parent B, looking mainly for positive attributes. However, when asked, "Which parent should be denied custody of the child?" they looked for negative attributes and the majority answered that Parent B should be denied custody, implying that Parent A should have custody.&lt;ref name="shafir"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shafir |first=E. |year=1993 |title=Choosing versus rejecting: why some options are both better and worse than others |journal=Memory and Cognition |volume=21 |pages=546–56 |pmid= 8350746 |issue=4 |doi=10.3758/bf03197186}} via {{Harvnb|Fine|2006|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar studies have demonstrated how people engage in a biased search for information, but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests. In an initial experiment, participants rated another person on the [[extroversion and introversion|introversion–extroversion]] personality dimension on the basis of an interview. They chose the interview questions from a given list. When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert, the participants chose questions that presumed introversion, such as, "What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties?" When the interviewee was described as extroverted, almost all the questions presumed extroversion, such as, "What would you do to liven up a dull party?" These loaded questions gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Snyder |first=Mark |first2=William B. |last2=Swann, Jr. |year=1978 |title=Hypothesis-Testing Processes in Social Interaction |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1202–12 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.11.1202}} via {{Harvnb|Poletiek|2001|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later version of the experiment gave the participants less presumptive questions to choose from, such as, "Do you shy away from social interactions?"&lt;ref name="kunda117" /&gt; Participants preferred to ask these more diagnostic questions, showing only a weak bias towards positive tests. This pattern, of a main preference for diagnostic tests and a weaker preference for positive tests, has been replicated in other studies.&lt;ref name="kunda117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personality traits influence and interact with biased search processes.&lt;ref name=albarracin&gt;{{Citation|last=Albarracin|first=D.|author2=Mitchell, A.L.|title=The Role of Defensive Confidence in Preference for Proattitudinal Information: How Believing That One Is Strong Can Sometimes Be a Defensive Weakness|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2004|volume=30|issue=12|pages=1565–84|doi=10.1177/0146167204271180|pmid=15536240|pmc=4803283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals vary in their abilities to defend their attitudes from external attacks in relation to [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]]. [[selective exposure theory|Selective exposure]] occurs when individuals search for information that is consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fischer|first=P.|author2=Fischer, Julia K. |author3=Aydin, Nilüfer |author4= Frey, Dieter |title=Physically Attractive Social Information Sources Lead to Increased Selective Exposure to Information|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=32|issue=4|pages=340–47|doi=10.1080/01973533.2010.519208}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment examined the extent to which individuals could refute arguments that contradicted their personal beliefs.&lt;ref name=albarracin /&gt; People with high [[confidence]] levels more readily seek out contradictory information to their personal position to form an argument. Individuals with low confidence levels do not seek out contradictory information and prefer information that supports their personal position. People generate and evaluate evidence in arguments that are biased towards their own beliefs and opinions.&lt;ref name=stanovich /&gt; Heightened confidence levels decrease preference for information that supports individuals' personal beliefs.

Another experiment gave participants a complex rule-discovery task that involved moving objects simulated by a computer.&lt;ref name="mynatt1978"&gt;{{Citation |last=Mynatt |first=Clifford R. |first2=Michael E. |last2=Doherty |first3=Ryan D. |last3=Tweney |year=1978 |title=Consequences of confirmation and disconfirmation in a simulated research environment |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=395–406 |doi =10.1080/00335557843000007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects on the computer screen followed specific laws, which the participants had to figure out. So, participants could "fire" objects across the screen to test their hypotheses. Despite making many attempts over a ten-hour session, none of the participants figured out the rules of the system. They typically attempted to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses, and were reluctant to consider alternatives. Even after seeing objective evidence that refuted their working hypotheses, they frequently continued doing the same tests. Some of the participants were taught proper hypothesis-testing, but these instructions had almost no effect.&lt;ref name="mynatt1978" /&gt;

=== Biased interpretation ===
{{Quote box |quote=Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons.|source=—[[Michael Shermer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kida|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30em |align=right}}

Confirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence. Even if two individuals have the same information, the way they interpret it can be biased.

A team at [[Stanford University]] conducted an experiment involving participants who felt strongly about capital punishment, with half in favor and half against it.&lt;ref name="lord1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name=baron201 /&gt; Each participant read descriptions of two studies: a comparison of [[U.S. state]]s with and without the death penalty, and a comparison of murder rates in a state before and after the introduction of the death penalty. After reading a quick description of each study, the participants were asked whether their opinions had changed. Then, they read a more detailed account of each study's procedure and had to rate whether the research was well-conducted and convincing.&lt;ref name="lord1979" /&gt; In fact, the studies were fictional. Half the participants were told that one kind of study supported the [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrent]] effect and the other undermined it, while for other participants the conclusions were swapped.&lt;ref name="lord1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baron201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=201–02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants, whether supporters or opponents, reported shifting their attitudes slightly in the direction of the first study they read. Once they read the more detailed descriptions of the two studies, they almost all returned to their original belief regardless of the evidence provided, pointing to details that supported their viewpoint and disregarding anything contrary. Participants described studies supporting their pre-existing view as superior to those that contradicted it, in detailed and specific ways.&lt;ref name="lord1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vyse122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vyse|1997|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about a study that seemed to undermine the deterrence effect, a death penalty proponent wrote, "The research didn't cover a long enough period of time," while an opponent's comment on the same study said, "No strong evidence to contradict the researchers has been presented."&lt;ref name="lord1979" /&gt; The results illustrated that people set higher standards of evidence for hypotheses that go against their current expectations. This effect, known as "disconfirmation bias", has been supported by other experiments.&lt;ref name="taber_political" /&gt;

Another study of biased interpretation occurred during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] and involved participants who reported having strong feelings about the candidates. They were shown apparently contradictory pairs of statements, either from Republican candidate [[George W. Bush]], Democratic candidate [[John Kerry]] or a politically neutral public figure. They were also given further statements that made the apparent contradiction seem reasonable. From these three pieces of information, they had to decide whether or not each individual's statements were inconsistent.&lt;ref name="westen2006"&gt;{{Citation|last=Westen |first=Drew |first2=Pavel S. |last2=Blagov |first3=Keith |last3=Harenski |first4=Clint |last4=Kilts |first5=Stephan |last5=Hamann |year=2006 |title=Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1947–58  |doi=10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1947 |pmid=17069484}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1948}} There were strong differences in these evaluations, with participants much more likely to interpret statements from the candidate they opposed as contradictory.&lt;ref name="westen2006" /&gt;{{rp|1951}}

[[File:MRI-Philips.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A large round machine with a hole in the middle, with a platter for a person to lie on so that their head can fit into the hole|An [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanner]] allowed researchers to examine how the human brain deals with unwelcome information]]

In this experiment, the participants made their judgments while in a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scanner which monitored their brain activity. As participants evaluated contradictory statements by their favored candidate, [[emotion]]al centers of their brains were aroused. This did not happen with the statements by the other figures. The experimenters inferred that the different responses to the statements were not due to passive reasoning errors. Instead, the participants were actively reducing the [[cognitive dissonance]] induced by reading about their favored candidate's irrational or [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] behavior.&lt;ref name="westen2006" /&gt;{{rp|1956}}

Biases in belief interpretation are persistent, regardless of intelligence level. Participants in an experiment took the [[SAT]] test (a college admissions test used in the United States) to assess their intelligence levels. They then read information regarding safety concerns for vehicles, and the experimenters manipulated the national origin of the car. American participants provided their opinion if the car should be banned on a six-point scale, where one indicated "definitely yes" and six indicated "definitely no". Participants firstly evaluated if they would allow a dangerous German car on American streets and a dangerous American car on German streets. Participants believed that the dangerous German car on American streets should be banned more quickly than the dangerous American car on German streets. There was no difference among intelligence levels at the rate participants would ban a car.&lt;ref name=stanovich&gt;{{Citation|last=Stanovich|first=K. E.|author2=West, R. F. |author3=Toplak, M. E. |title=Myside Bias, Rational Thinking, and Intelligence|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=4|pages=259–64|doi=10.1177/0963721413480174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biased interpretation is not restricted to emotionally significant topics. In another experiment, participants were told a story about a theft. They had to rate the evidential importance of statements arguing either for or against a particular character being responsible. When they hypothesized that character's guilt, they rated statements supporting that hypothesis as more important than conflicting statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gadenne |first=V. |first2=M. |last2=Oswald |year=1986 |title=Entstehung und Veränderung von Bestätigungstendenzen beim Testen von Hypothesen [Formation and alteration of confirmatory tendencies during the testing of hypotheses] |journal=Zeitschrift für experimentelle und angewandte Psychologie |volume=33 |pages=360–74}} via {{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biased memory ===
People may remember evidence selectively to reinforce their expectations, even if they gather and interpret evidence in a neutral manner. This effect is called "selective recall", "confirmatory memory", or "access-biased memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hastie |first=Reid |first2=Bernadette |last2=Park |chapter=The Relationship Between Memory and Judgment Depends on Whether the Judgment Task is Memory-Based or On-Line |title=Social cognition: key readings |editor-first=David L. |editor-last=Hamilton |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2005 |page=394 |isbn=0-86377-591-8 |oclc=55078722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories differ in their predictions about selective recall. [[Schema (psychology)|Schema theory]] predicts that information matching prior expectations will be more easily stored and recalled than information that does not match.&lt;ref name=oswald88 /&gt; Some alternative approaches say that surprising information stands out and so is memorable.&lt;ref name="oswald88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions from both these theories have been confirmed in different experimental contexts, with no theory winning outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stangor |first=Charles |first2=David |last2=McMillan |year=1992 |title= Memory for expectancy-congruent and expectancy-incongruent information: A review of the social and social developmental literatures |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=42–61 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, participants read a profile of a woman which described a mix of introverted and extroverted behaviors.&lt;ref name="snydercantor" /&gt; They later had to recall examples of her introversion and extroversion. One group was told this was to assess the woman for a job as a librarian, while a second group were told it was for a job in real estate sales. There was a significant difference between what these two groups recalled, with the "librarian" group recalling more examples of introversion and the "sales" groups recalling more extroverted behavior.&lt;ref name="snydercantor"&gt;{{Citation |last= Snyder |first=M. |first2=N. |last2=Cantor |year=1979 |title=Testing hypotheses about other people: the use of historical knowledge |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=15 |pages=330–42 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(79)90042-8 |issue= 4}} via {{Harvnb|Goldacre|2008|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; A selective memory effect has also been shown in experiments that manipulate the desirability of personality types.&lt;ref name=oswald88 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=225–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of these, a group of participants were shown evidence that extroverted people are more successful than introverts. Another group were told the opposite. In a subsequent, apparently unrelated study, participants were asked to recall events from their lives in which they had been either introverted or extroverted. Each group of participants provided more memories connecting themselves with the more desirable personality type, and recalled those memories more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sanitioso |first=Rasyid |first2=Ziva |last2=Kunda |first3=G.T. |last3=Fong |year=1990 |title= Motivated recruitment of autobiographical memories |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |issn=0022-3514 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=229–41 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229 |pmid=2213492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in emotional states can also influence memory recall.&lt;ref name=levine&gt;{{Citation|last=Levine|first=L.|author2=Prohaska, V. |author3=Burgess, S.L. |author4=Rice, J.A. |author5=Laulhere, T.M. |title=Remembering past emotions: The role of current appraisals|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2001|volume=15|issue=4|pages=393–417|doi=10.1080/02699930125955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=safer&gt;{{Citation|last=Safer|first=M.A.|author2=Bonanno, G.A. |author3=Field, N. |title="It was never that bad": Biased recall of grief and long-term adjustment to the death of a spouse|journal=Memory|year=2001|volume=9|issue=3|pages=195–203|doi=10.1080/09658210143000065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants rated how they felt when they had first learned that [[O.J. Simpson]] had been acquitted of murder charges.&lt;ref name="levine"/&gt; They described their emotional reactions and confidence regarding the verdict one week, two months, and one year after the trial. Results indicated that participants' assessments for Simpson's guilt changed over time. The more that participants' opinion of the verdict had changed, the less stable were the participant's memories regarding their initial emotional reactions. When participants recalled their initial emotional reactions two months and a year later, past appraisals closely resembled current appraisals of emotion. People demonstrate sizable myside bias when discussing their opinions on controversial topics.&lt;ref name=stanovich /&gt; Memory recall and construction of experiences undergo revision in relation to corresponding emotional states.

Myside bias has been shown to influence the accuracy of memory recall.&lt;ref name="safer"/&gt; In an experiment, widows and widowers rated the intensity of their experienced grief six months and five years after the deaths of their spouses. Participants noted a higher experience of grief at six months rather than at five years. Yet, when the participants were asked after five years how they had felt six months after the death of their significant other, the intensity of grief participants recalled was highly correlated with their current level of grief. Individuals appear to utilize their current emotional states to analyze how they must have felt when experiencing past events.&lt;ref name=levine /&gt; Emotional memories are reconstructed by current emotional states.

One study showed how selective memory can maintain belief in [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP).&lt;ref name="russell_jones"&gt;{{Citation |last=Russell |first=Dan |first2=Warren H. |last2=Jones |year=1980 |title=When superstition fails: Reactions to disconfirmation of paranormal beliefs |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages= 83–88 |issn=1552-7433 |doi=10.1177/014616728061012}} via {{Harvnb|Vyse|1997|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers and disbelievers were each shown descriptions of ESP experiments. Half of each group were told that the experimental results supported the existence of ESP, while the others were told they did not. In a subsequent test, participants recalled the material accurately, apart from believers who had read the non-supportive evidence. This group remembered significantly less information and some of them incorrectly remembered the results as supporting ESP.&lt;ref name="russell_jones" /&gt;

=== Polarization of opinion ===
{{Main|Attitude polarization}}
When people with opposing views interpret new information in a biased way, their views can move even further apart. This is called "attitude polarization".&lt;ref name="kuhn_lao" /&gt; The effect was demonstrated by an experiment that involved drawing a series of red and black balls from one of two concealed "bingo baskets". Participants knew that one basket contained 60% black and 40% red balls; the other, 40% black and 60% red. The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn, a sequence that does not favor either basket. After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw—whether they initially thought the basket with 60% black balls or the one with 60% red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball. They did not show the polarization effect, suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions, but rather when they openly commit to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence. Twenty-three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme, and this self-reported shift [[correlation|correlated]] strongly with their initial attitudes.&lt;ref name="lord1979"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lord |first=Charles G. |first2=Lee |last2 =Ross |first3=Mark R. |last3=Lepper |year=1979 |title=Biased assimilation and attitude polarization: The effects of prior theories on subsequently considered evidence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=2098–209 |issn=0022-3514 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2098|citeseerx=10.1.1.372.1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later experiments, participants also reported their opinions becoming more extreme in response to ambiguous information. However, comparisons of their attitudes before and after the new evidence showed no significant change, suggesting that the self-reported changes might not be real.&lt;ref name="taber_political"&gt;{{Citation |last=Taber |first=Charles S. |first2=Milton |last2=Lodge |date=July 2006 |title=Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=755–69 |issn=0092-5853 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuhn_lao"&gt;{{Citation |last=Kuhn |first=Deanna |first2=Joseph |last2=Lao |date=March 1996 |title=Effects of Evidence on Attitudes: Is Polarization the Norm? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=115–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00340.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=A.G.|first2=J.W. |last2=McHoskey |first3=C.M. |last3=Bane |first4=T.G. |last4=Dowd |year=1993 |title=The attitude polarization phenomenon: Role of response measure, attitude extremity, and behavioral consequences of reported attitude change |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=64 |pages=561–74 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.561 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these experiments, Deanna Kuhn and Joseph Lao concluded that polarization is a real phenomenon but far from inevitable, only happening in a small minority of cases. They found that it was prompted not only by considering mixed evidence, but by merely thinking about the topic.&lt;ref name="kuhn_lao" /&gt;

Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team's result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response. The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of [[gun politics|gun control]] and [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref name="taber_political" /&gt; They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate. Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable. In part of this study, participants chose which information sources to read, from a list prepared by the experimenters. For example, they could read the [[National Rifle Association]]'s and the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition]]'s arguments on gun control. Even when instructed to be even-handed, participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not. This biased search for information correlated well with the polarization effect.&lt;ref name="taber_political" /&gt;

The '''{{vanchor|backfire effect}}''' is a name for the finding that given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.skepdic.com/backfireeffect.html|title=backfire effect|work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CJR backfire'&gt;{{Citation| url = http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_backfire_effect.php | title = The Backfire Effect | accessdate = 2012-05-01 | last = Silverman | first = Craig | date = 2011-06-17 | work = Columbia Journalism Review | quote = When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first coined by [[Brendan Nyhan]] and Jason Reifler in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Nyhan | first1 = Brendan | last2 = Reifler | first2 = Jason | title = When corrections fail: the persistence of political misperceptions | journal = [[Political Behavior (journal)|Political Behavior]] | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 303–30 | doi = 10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2 | date = June 2010 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/nyhan-reifler.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research has since failed to replicate findings supporting  the backfire effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://educationblog.oup.com/theory-of-knowledge/facts-matter-after-all-rejecting-the-backfire-effect|title=Facts matter after all: rejecting the “backfire effect”|date=2018-03-12|work=Oxford Education Blog|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study conducted out of the Ohio State University and George Washington University studied 10,100 participants with 52 different issues expected to trigger a backfire effect.

=== Persistence of discredited beliefs ===
{{main|Belief perseverance}}

{{Quote box |quote=[B]eliefs can survive potent logical or empirical challenges.

They can even survive the total destruction of their original evidential bases. |source=—Lee Ross and Craig Anderson&lt;ref name="shortcomings" /&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
Confirmation biases can be used to explain why some beliefs persist when the initial evidence for them is removed.&lt;ref name="nick187" /&gt; This belief perseverance effect has been shown by a series of experiments using what is called the "debriefing paradigm": participants read fake evidence for a hypothesis, their [[attitude change]] is measured, then the fakery is exposed in detail. Their attitudes are then measured once more to see if their belief returns to its previous level.&lt;ref name="shortcomings"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ross |first=Lee |first2=Craig A. |last2=Anderson |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4157 |pages=1124–1131 |bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T |doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 |year=1974}}&lt;br/&gt;*{{Citation|editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos |editor3-last=Tversky |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982  |chapter=Shortcomings in the attribution process: On the origins and maintenance of erroneous social assessments |isbn=978-0-521-28414-1 |oclc=7578020|title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common finding is that at least some of the initial belief remains even after a full debriefing.&lt;ref name="kunda99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, participants had to distinguish between real and fake suicide notes. The feedback was random: some were told they had done well while others were told they had performed badly. Even after being fully debriefed, participants were still influenced by the feedback. They still thought they were better or worse than average at that kind of task, depending on what they had initially been told.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ross |first=Lee |first2=Mark R. |last2=Lepper |first3=Michael |last3=Hubbard |title=Perseverance in self-perception and social perception: Biased attributional processes in the debriefing paradigm |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=32 |publisher=American Psychological Association |issn=0022-3514 |pages=880–92 |issue=5 |year=1975 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.5.880 |pmid=1185517}} via {{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, participants read [[job performance]] ratings of two firefighters, along with their responses to a [[risk aversion]] test.&lt;ref name="shortcomings" /&gt; This fictional data was arranged to show either a negative or positive [[correlation|association]]: some participants were told that a risk-taking firefighter did better, while others were told they did less well than a risk-averse colleague.&lt;ref name="socialperseverance" /&gt; Even if these two case studies were true, they would have been scientifically poor evidence for a conclusion about firefighters in general. However, the participants found them subjectively persuasive.&lt;ref name="socialperseverance"&gt;{{Citation |title=Perseverance of Social Theories: The Role of Explanation in the Persistence of Discredited Information |first=Craig A. |last=Anderson |first2=Mark R. |last2=Lepper |first3=Lee |last3=Ross |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1980 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1037–49 |publisher= American Psychological Association |issn=0022-3514 |doi=10.1037/h0077720}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the case studies were shown to be fictional, participants' belief in a link diminished, but around half of the original effect remained.&lt;ref name="shortcomings" /&gt; Follow-up interviews established that the participants had understood the debriefing and taken it seriously. Participants seemed to trust the debriefing, but regarded the discredited information as irrelevant to their personal belief.&lt;ref name="socialperseverance" /&gt;

The ''{{vanchor|continued influence effect}}'' is the tendency to believe previously learned misinformation even after it has been corrected. Misinformation can still influence inferences one generates after a correction has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Johnson |first1=Hollyn M. |author2=Colleen M. Seifert |date=November 1994 |title=Sources of the continued influence effect: When misinformation in memory affects later inferences |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=20 |issue=6|pages=1420–36 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preference for early information ===
Experiments have shown that information is weighted more strongly when it appears early in a series, even when the order is unimportant. For example, people form a more positive impression of someone described as "intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious" than when they are given the same words in reverse order.&lt;ref name="baron197"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''irrational primacy effect'' is independent of the [[serial position effect|primacy effect in memory]] in which the earlier items in a series leave a stronger memory trace.&lt;ref name="baron197" /&gt; Biased interpretation offers an explanation for this effect: seeing the initial evidence, people form a working hypothesis that affects how they interpret the rest of the information.&lt;ref name="nick187"&gt;{{Harvnb |Nickerson|1998|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One demonstration of irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn from two urns. Participants were told the color distributions of the urns, and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them.&lt;ref name="baron197" /&gt; In fact, the colors appeared in a prearranged order. The first thirty draws favored one urn and the next thirty favored the other.&lt;ref name=nick187 /&gt; The series as a whole was neutral, so rationally, the two urns were equally likely. However, after sixty draws, participants favored the urn suggested by the initial thirty.&lt;ref name="baron197" /&gt;

Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object, seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide.&lt;ref name="baron197" /&gt; After each slide, participants had to state their best guess of what the object was. Participants whose early guesses were wrong persisted with those guesses, even when the picture was sufficiently in focus that the object was readily recognizable to other people.&lt;ref name="nick187" /&gt;

=== Illusory association between events ===
{{Main|Illusory correlation}}
Illusory correlation is the tendency to see non-existent correlations in a set of data.&lt;ref name=fine&gt;{{Harvnb |Fine|2006|pp=66–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was first demonstrated in a series of experiments in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="plous164"&gt;{{Harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=164–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, participants read a set of psychiatric case studies, including responses to the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]. The participants reported that the homosexual men in the set were more likely to report seeing buttocks, anuses or sexually ambiguous figures in the inkblots. In fact the fictional case studies had been constructed so that the homosexual men were no more likely to report this imagery or, in one version of the experiment, were less likely to report it than heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=fine /&gt; In a survey, a group of experienced psychoanalysts reported the same set of illusory associations with homosexuality.&lt;ref name=fine /&gt;&lt;ref name=plous164 /&gt;

Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients, along with weather conditions over a 15-month period. Nearly all the patients reported that their pains were correlated with weather conditions, although the real correlation was zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Redelmeir |first=D. A. |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |year=1996 |title=On the belief that arthritis pain is related to the weather |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=93 |pages=2895–96 |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.7.2895 |issue=7|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.2895R |pmc=39730 }} via {{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect is a kind of biased interpretation, in that objectively neutral or unfavorable evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs. It is also related to biases in hypothesis-testing behavior.&lt;ref name="kunda127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=127–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In judging whether two events, such as illness and bad weather, are correlated, people rely heavily on the number of ''positive-positive'' cases: in this example, instances of both pain and bad weather. They pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation (of no pain and/or good weather).&lt;ref name="plous162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|pp=162–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This parallels the reliance on positive tests in hypothesis testing.&lt;ref name="kunda127" /&gt; It may also reflect selective recall, in that people may have a sense that two events are correlated because it is easier to recall times when they happened together.&lt;ref name="kunda127" /&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Myside bias was once believed to be associated with greater intelligence; however, studies have shown that myside bias can be more influenced by ability to rationally think as opposed to level of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Stanovich|first=K. E.|author2=West, R. F. |author3=Toplak, M. E. |title=Myside Bias, Rational Thinking, and Intelligence|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=5 August 2013|volume=22|issue=4|pages=259–64|doi=10.1177/0963721413480174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myside bias can cause an inability to effectively and logically evaluate the opposite side of an argument. Studies have stated that myside bias is an absence of "active open-mindedness", meaning the active search for why an initial idea may be wrong.&lt;ref name="Baron 1995"&gt;{{Citation|last=Baron|first=Jonathan|title=Myside bias in thinking about abortion.|journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning|year=1995|pages=221–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, myside bias is operationalized in empirical studies as the quantity of evidence used in support of their side in comparison to the opposite side.&lt;ref name="Wolfe 2008"&gt;{{Citation|last=Wolfe|first=Christopher|author2=Anne Britt|title=The locus of the myside bias in written argumentation|journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning|year=2008|volume=14|pages=1–27|url=http://think.psy.muohio.edu/home/WolfePublications/Wolfe_Locus_My%20Side%20Bias_2008.pdf|doi=10.1080/13546780701527674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study has found individual differences in myside bias. This study investigates individual differences that are acquired through learning in a cultural context and are mutable. The researcher found important individual difference in argumentation. Studies have suggested that individual differences such as deductive reasoning ability, ability to overcome belief bias, epistemological understanding, and thinking disposition are significant predictors of the reasoning and generating arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals.&lt;ref name="Mason 2006"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mason|first=Lucia|author2=Scirica, Fabio|title=Prediction of students' argumentation skills about controversial topics by epistemological understanding|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=October 2006|volume=16|issue=5|pages=492–509|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2009"&gt;{{Citation|last=Weinstock|first=Michael|title=Relative expertise in an everyday reasoning task: Epistemic understanding, problem representation, and reasoning competence|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=4|pages=423–34|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2009.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2004"&gt;{{Citation|last=Weinstock|first=Michael|author2=Neuman, Yair |author3=Tabak, Iris |title=Missing the point or missing the norms?

A study by Christopher Wolfe and Anne Britt also investigated how participants' views of "what makes a good argument?" can be a source of myside bias that influence the way a person formulates his own arguments.&lt;ref name="Wolfe 2008" /&gt; The study investigated individual differences of argumentation schema and asked participants to write essays. The participants were randomly assigned to write essays either for or against their preferred side of an argument and were given research instructions that took either a balanced or an unrestricted approach. The balanced-research instructions directed participants to create a "balanced" argument, i.e., that included both pros and cons; the unrestricted-research instructions included nothing on how to create the argument.&lt;ref name="Wolfe 2008" /&gt;

Overall, the results revealed that the balanced-research instructions significantly increased the incidence of opposing information in arguments. These data also reveal that personal belief is not a ''source'' of myside bias; however, that those participants, who believe that a good argument is one that is based on facts, are more likely to exhibit myside bias than other participants. This evidence is consistent with the claims proposed in Baron's article—that people's opinions about what makes good thinking can influence how arguments are generated.&lt;ref name="Wolfe 2008" /&gt;

=== Informal observation ===
Before psychological research on confirmation bias, the phenomenon had been observed throughout history. Beginning with the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 395&amp;nbsp;BC), who wrote of misguided treason in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War|The Peloponnesian War]]''; "...&amp;nbsp;for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|108|4|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321), noted it in his famous work, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', in which [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] cautions Dante upon meeting in Paradise, "opinion—hasty—often can incline to the wrong side, and then affection for one's own opinion binds, confines the mind".&lt;ref&gt;Alighieri, Dante. ''Paradiso'' canto XIII: 118–20. Trans. Allen Mandelbaum&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun]] noticed the same effect in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'': {{quote|Untruth naturally afflicts historical information. There are various reasons that make this unavoidable. One of them is partisanship for opinions and schools. [...] if the soul is infected with partisanship for a particular opinion or sect, it accepts without a moment's hesitation the information that is agreeable to it. Prejudice and partisanship obscure the critical faculty and preclude critical investigation. The result is that falsehoods are accepted and transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Muqadimmah |author=Ibn Khaldun |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1958 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the ''[[Novum Organum]]'', English philosopher and scientist [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626)&lt;ref name="baron195"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=195–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that biased assessment of evidence drove "all superstitions, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments or the like".&lt;ref name="bacon"&gt;Bacon, Francis (1620). ''Novum Organum''. reprinted in {{Citation |title=The English philosophers from Bacon to Mill |editor-first=E.A. |editor-last=Burtt |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1939 |page=36}} via {{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:
{{quote|The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion&amp;nbsp;...&lt;!--"(either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself)" omitted for space--&gt; draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects or despises, or else by some distinction sets aside or rejects[.]&lt;ref name="bacon" /&gt;}}
In the second volume of his ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1844), German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] observed that "An adopted hypothesis gives us lynx-eyes for everything that confirms it and makes us blind to everything that contradicts it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=''The World as Will and Presentation'' |volume=2 |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Carus |editor2-first=Richard E. |editor2-last=Aquila |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |orig-year=1844 |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his essay (1897) "[[What Is Art?]]", Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wrote: {{quote|I know that most men—not only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems—can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty—conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Leo. ''What is Art?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;vq=falsity&amp;dq=tolstoy+%2B+%22what+is+art%22&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1 p. 124] (1899). In ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'' (1893), he similarly declared, "The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him." (ch. 3). Translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett, New York, 1894. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4602 Project Gutenberg edition] released November 2002. Retrieved 2009-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Wason's research on hypothesis-testing ===
The term "confirmation bias" was coined by English psychologist [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gale |first=Maggie |first2=Linden J. |last2=Ball |year=2002 |chapter=Does Positivity Bias Explain Patterns of Performance on Wason's 2-4-6 task? |editor1-first=Wayne D. |editor1-last=Gray |editor2-first=Christian D. |editor2-last=Schunn |title=Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8058-4581-5 |oclc=469971634 |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an experiment published in 1960, he challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers. At the outset, they were told that (2,4,6) fits the rule. Participants could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule.&lt;ref name="wason1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the actual rule was simply "any ascending sequence", the participants had a great deal of difficulty in finding it, often announcing rules that were far more specific, such as "the middle number is the average of the first and last".&lt;ref name="wason1960"&gt;{{Citation |last=Wason |first=Peter C. |year=1960 |title=On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=12 |issue=3 |publisher=Psychology Press |issn=1747-0226 |pages=129–40 |doi=10.1080/17470216008416717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants seemed to test only positive examples—triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule. For example, if they thought the rule was, "Each number is two greater than its predecessor," they would offer a triple that fit this rule, such as (11,13,15) rather than a triple that violates it, such as (11,12,19).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewicka|1998|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wason accepted [[falsificationism]], according to which a scientific test of a hypothesis is a serious attempt to falsify it. He interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification, hence the term "confirmation bias".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Wason also used the term "verification bias". {{Harv|Poletiek|2001|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oswald"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=79–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wason also used confirmation bias to explain the results of his [[Wason selection task|selection task]] experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wason |first=Peter C. |year=1968 |title=Reasoning about a rule |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |publisher=Psychology Press |issn= 1747-0226 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=273–28 |doi=10.1080/14640746808400161 |pmid=5683766}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this task, participants are given partial information about a set of objects, and have to specify what further information they would need to tell whether or not a [[material conditional|conditional rule]] ("If A, then B") applies. It has been found repeatedly that people perform badly on various forms of this test, in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute the rule.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Barkow |first=Jerome H. |first2=Leda |last2=Cosmides |first3=John |last3=Tooby |title=The adapted mind: evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1995 |pages=181–84 |isbn=978-0-19-510107-2 |oclc=33832963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term 'confirmation bias' is frequently located as being in Wason 1960, he did not use that label in his 1960 article.

=== Klayman and Ha's critique ===
A 1987 paper by Joshua Klayman and Young-Won Ha argued that the Wason experiments had not actually demonstrated a bias towards confirmation. Instead, Klayman and Ha interpreted the results in terms of a tendency to make tests that are consistent with the working hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=81–82, 86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called this the "positive test strategy".&lt;ref name=kunda112 /&gt; This strategy is an example of a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]]: a reasoning shortcut that is imperfect but easy to compute.&lt;ref name="plous233"&gt;{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klayman and Ha used [[Bayesian probability]] and [[information theory]] as their standard of hypothesis-testing, rather than the falsificationism used by Wason. According to these ideas, each answer to a question yields a different amount of information, which depends on the person's prior beliefs. Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative. Klayman and Ha argued that when people think about realistic problems, they are looking for a specific answer with a small initial probability. In this case, positive tests are usually more informative than negative tests.&lt;ref name="klaymanha"&gt;{{Citation |last=Klayman |first= Joshua |first2=Young-Won |last2=Ha |year=1987 |title=Confirmation, Disconfirmation and Information in Hypothesis Testing |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=211–28 |issn=0033-295X |url=http://www.stats.org.uk/statistical-inference/KlaymanHa1987.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-14 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Wason's rule discovery task the answer—three numbers in ascending order—is very broad, so positive tests are unlikely to yield informative answers. Klayman and Ha supported their analysis by citing an experiment that used the labels "DAX" and "MED" in place of "fits the rule" and "doesn't fit the rule". This avoided implying that the aim was to find a low-probability rule. Participants had much more success with this version of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewicka|1998|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tweney |first=Ryan D. |first2=Michael E. |last2=Doherty |first3=Winifred J. |last3=Worner |first4=Daniel B. |last4=Pliske |first5=Clifford R. |last5=Mynatt |first6=Kimberly A. |last6=Gross |first7=Daniel L. |last7= Arkkelin |year=1980 |title=Strategies of rule discovery in an inference task |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |publisher=Psychology Press |issn=1747-0226 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 109–23 |doi=10.1080/00335558008248237}} (Experiment&amp;nbsp;IV)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
In light of this and other critiques, the focus of research moved away from confirmation versus falsification to examine whether people test hypotheses in an informative way, or an uninformative but positive way. The search for "true" confirmation bias led psychologists to look at a wider range of effects in how people process information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=86–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
Confirmation bias is often described as a result of automatic, unintentional strategies rather than deliberate deception.&lt;ref name="oswald82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hergovich 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hergovich|Schott|Burger|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert MacCoun]], most biased evidence processing occurs through a combination of both "cold" (cognitive) and "hot" (motivated) mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCoun|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive explanations for confirmation bias are based on limitations in people's ability to handle complex tasks, and the shortcuts, called ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]'', that they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedrich|1993|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people may judge the reliability of evidence by using the ''[[availability heuristic]]''—i.e., how readily a particular idea comes to mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that people can only focus on one thought at a time, so find it difficult to test alternative hypotheses in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another heuristic is the positive test strategy identified by Klayman and Ha, in which people test a hypothesis by examining cases where they expect a property or event to occur. This heuristic avoids the difficult or impossible task of working out how diagnostic each possible question will be. However, it is not universally reliable, so people can overlook challenges to their existing beliefs.&lt;ref name="klaymanha" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivational explanations involve an effect of [[desire (emotion)|desire]] on [[belief]], sometimes called "[[wishful thinking]]".&lt;ref name=nick197 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that people prefer pleasant thoughts over unpleasant ones in a number of ways: this is called the "[[Pollyanna principle]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Matlin |first=Margaret W. |title=Cognitive Illusions: A Handbook on Fallacies and Biases in Thinking, Judgement and Memory |editor-first=Rüdiger F. |editor-last=Pohl |publisher=Psychology Press |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages=255–72 |chapter=Pollyanna Principle |isbn= 978-1-84169-351-4 |oclc=55124398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to [[argument]]s or sources of [[evidence]], this could explain why desired conclusions are more likely to be believed true.&lt;ref name="nick197"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to experiments that manipulate the desirability of the conclusion, people demand a high standard of evidence for unpalatable ideas and a low standard for preferred ideas. In other words, they ask, "Can I believe this?" for some suggestions and, "Must I believe this?" for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dawson |first=Erica |first2=Thomas |last2=Gilovich |first3=Dennis T. |last3=Regan |date=October 2002 |title=Motivated Reasoning and Performance on the Wason Selection Task |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1379–87 |doi=10.1177/014616702236869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ditto |first=Peter H. |first2= David F. |last2=Lopez |year=1992 |title=Motivated skepticism: use of differential decision criteria for preferred and nonpreferred conclusions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=568–84 |issn=0022-3514 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[consistency]] is a desirable feature of attitudes, an excessive drive for consistency is another potential source of bias because it may prevent people from neutrally evaluating new, surprising information.&lt;ref name=nick197 /&gt; Social psychologist [[Ziva Kunda]] combines the cognitive and motivational theories, arguing that motivation creates the bias, but cognitive factors determine the size of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations in terms of [[cost-benefit analysis]] assume that people do not just test hypotheses in a disinterested way, but assess the costs of different errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ideas from [[evolutionary psychology]], James Friedrich suggests that people do not primarily aim at [[truth]] in testing hypotheses, but try to avoid the most costly errors. For example, employers might ask one-sided questions in job interviews because they are focused on weeding out unsuitable candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedrich|1993|pp=299, 316–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yaacov Trope and Akiva Liberman's refinement of this theory assumes that people compare the two different kinds of error: accepting a false hypothesis or rejecting a true hypothesis. For instance, someone who underestimates a friend's honesty might treat him or her suspiciously and so undermine the friendship. Overestimating the friend's honesty may also be costly, but less so. In this case, it would be rational to seek, evaluate or remember evidence of their honesty in a biased way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Trope |first=Y. |first2=A. |last2=Liberman |title=Social Psychology: Handbook of basic principles |editor1-first=E.

The connection between confirmation bias and social skills was corroborated by a study of how college students get to know other people. Highly [[self-monitoring]] students, who are more sensitive to their environment and to [[social norms]], asked more matching questions when interviewing a high-status staff member than when getting to know fellow students.&lt;ref name="dardenne"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dardenne |first=Benoit |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last2=Leyens |title=Confirmation Bias as a Social Skill |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=1995 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1229–39 |doi=10.1177/01461672952111011 |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |issn=1552-7433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists [[Jennifer Lerner]] and [[Philip Tetlock]] distinguish two different kinds of thinking process. ''[[Exploratory thought]]'' neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to a particular position, while ''confirmatory thought'' seeks to justify a specific point of view. Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to justify their position to others whose views they already know, they will tend to adopt a similar position to those people, and then use confirmatory thought to bolster their own credibility. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor= Sandra L. Schneider|title=Emerging perspectives on judgment and decision research|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [u.&amp;nbsp;a.]|isbn=0-521-52718-X|page=445|author=Shanteau, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to others who are well-informed, genuinely interested in the truth, and whose views they don't already know.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title=The Righteous Mind : Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion|year=2012|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-307-37790-3|pages=1473–74 (e–book edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because those conditions rarely exist, they argue, most people are using confirmatory thought most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor1-first=Susan T.|editor1-last=Fiske|editor2-first=Daniel T.|editor2-last=Gilbert|editor3-first=Gardner|editor3-last=Lindzey|title=The handbook of social psychology|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=0-470-13749-5|page=811|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental psychologist Eve Whitmore has argued that beliefs and biases involved in confirmation bias have their roots in childhood coping through make-believe, which becomes "the basis for more complex forms of self-deception and illusion into adulthood." The friction brought on by questioning as an adolescent with developing critical thinking can lead to the rationalization of false beliefs, and the habit of such rationalization can become unconscious over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=American Psychological Association |title=Why We're Susceptible to Fake News -- and How to Defend Against It |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

=== In finance ===
Confirmation bias can lead investors to be overconfident, ignoring evidence that their strategies will lose money.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Behavioral finance and wealth management: how to build optimal portfolios that account for investor biases |first=Michael M. |last=Pompian |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-74517-4 |oclc=61864118 |year=2006 |pages=187–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies of [[election stock market|political stock markets]], investors made more profit when they resisted bias. For example, participants who interpreted a candidate's debate performance in a neutral rather than partisan way were more likely to profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hilton |first=Denis J. |journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance |year=2001 |title=The psychology of financial decision-making: Applications to trading, dealing, and investment analysis |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1207/S15327760JPFM0201_4 |publisher=Institute of Behavioral Finance |issn=1542-7579 |pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the effect of confirmation bias, investors can try to adopt a contrary viewpoint "for the sake of argument".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last= Krueger |first2=John David |last2=Mann |title=The Secret Language of Money: How to Make Smarter Financial Decisions and Live a Richer Life |isbn=978-0-07-162339-1 |oclc=277205993 |year=2009 |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |pages=112–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one technique, they imagine that their investments have collapsed and ask themselves why this might happen.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;

=== In physical and mental health ===
Raymond Nickerson, a psychologist, blames confirmation bias for the ineffective medical procedures that were used for centuries before the [[History of medicine|arrival of scientific medicine]].&lt;ref name="nick192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a patient recovered, medical authorities counted the treatment as successful, rather than looking for alternative explanations such as that the disease had run its natural course.&lt;ref name=nick192 /&gt; Biased assimilation is a factor in the modern appeal of [[alternative medicine]], whose proponents are swayed by positive [[anecdotal evidence]] but treat [[scientific evidence]] hyper-critically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldacre|2008|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Singh |first=Simon | authorlink=Simon Singh |first2=Edzard |last2=Ernst | authorlink2=Edzard Ernst |title=[[Trick or Treatment?: Alternative Medicine on Trial]] |publisher= Bantam |location=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-593-06129-9 |pages=287–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Atwood |first=Kimball |year=2004 |title=Naturopathy, Pseudoscience, and Medicine: Myths and Fallacies vs Truth |journal=Medscape General Medicine |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Confirmation bias may also cause doctors to perform unnecessary medical procedures due to pressure from adamant patients.&lt;ref name="hospitalbias"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Pang|first1=Dominic|last2=Bleetman|first2=Anthony|last3=Bleetman|first3=David|last4=Wynne|first4=Max|title=The foreign body that never was: the effects of confirmation bias|journal=British Journal of Hospital Medicine|date=2 June 2017|volume=78|issue=6|pages=350–351|doi=10.12968/hmed.2017.78.6.350|pmid=28614014|url=http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/hmed.2017.78.6.350?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cognitive therapy]] was developed by [[Aaron T. Beck]] in the early 1960s and has become a popular approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Neenan |first2=Windy |last2=Dryden |year=2004 |title=Cognitive therapy: 100 key points and techniques |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-58391-858-6 |oclc=474568621 |page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beck, biased information processing is a factor in [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Ivy-Marie |last=Blackburn |first2=Kate M. |last2=Davidson |year=1995 |title=Cognitive therapy for depression &amp; anxiety: a practitioner's guide |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-03986-9 |oclc=32699443 |edition=2 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approach teaches people to treat evidence impartially, rather than selectively reinforcing negative outlooks.&lt;ref name="baron195" /&gt; [[Phobias]] and [[hypochondria]] have also been shown to involve confirmation bias for threatening information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Allison G. |last=Harvey |first2=Edward |last2=Watkins |first3= Warren |last3=Mansell |year=2004 |title=Cognitive behavioural processes across psychological disorders: a transdiagnostic approach to research and treatment |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-852888-3 |oclc=602015097 |pages=172–73, 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In politics and law ===
[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A woman and a man reading a document in a courtroom|[[Mock trial]]s allow researchers to examine confirmation biases in a realistic setting]]
Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased, favoring conclusions that judges, juries or governments have already committed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the evidence in a jury trial can be complex, and jurors often reach decisions about the verdict early on, it is reasonable to expect an attitude polarization effect. The prediction that jurors will become more extreme in their views as they see more evidence has been borne out in experiments with [[mock trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Myers |first=D.G. |first2=H. |last2=Lamm |year=1976 |title=The group polarization phenomenon |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=83 |pages=602–27 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.4.602 |issue=4}} via {{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=193–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halpern"&gt;{{Citation |last=Halpern |first=Diane F. |title=Critical thinking across the curriculum: a brief edition of thought and knowledge |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1987 |page=194 |isbn=978-0-8058-2731-6 |oclc=37180929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] and [[Adversarial system|adversarial]] criminal justice systems are affected by confirmation bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Roach |first= Kent |ssrn=1619124 |title=Wrongful Convictions: Adversarial and Inquisitorial Themes |journal= North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation |volume=35 |year=2010|quote=Both adversarial and inquisitorial systems seem subject to the dangers of tunnel vision or confirmation bias.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts, from emotionally charged debates to wars: by interpreting the evidence in their favor, each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position.&lt;ref name="baron191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=191, 195}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, confirmation bias can result in people ignoring or misinterpreting the signs of an imminent or incipient conflict. For example, psychologists [[Stuart Sutherland]] and Thomas Kida have each argued that [[U.S. Navy]] Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]] showed confirmation bias when playing down the first signs of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kida|2006|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-decade study of political pundits by [[Philip E. Tetlock]] found that, on the whole, their predictions were not much better than chance. Tetlock divided experts into "foxes" who maintained multiple hypotheses, and "hedgehogs" who were more dogmatic. In general, the hedgehogs were much less accurate. Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias—specifically, their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tetlock |first=Philip E. |title=Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-691-12302-8 |oclc=56825108 |pages=125–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the paranormal ===
One factor in the appeal of alleged [[psychic]] readings is that listeners apply a confirmation bias which fits the psychic's statements to their own lives.&lt;ref name="toolkit"&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first= Jonathan C. |title=Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2009 |pages=149–51 |isbn=978-1-4051-8122-8 |oclc=319499491}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making a large number of ambiguous statements in each sitting, the psychic gives the client more opportunities to find a match. This is one of the techniques of [[cold reading]], with which a psychic can deliver a subjectively impressive reading without any prior information about the client.&lt;ref name="toolkit" /&gt; Investigator [[James Randi]] compared the transcript of a reading to the client's report of what the psychic had said, and found that the client showed a strong selective recall of the "hits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Randi |first=James |title=James Randi: psychic investigator |publisher=Boxtree |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-85283-144-8 |oclc= 26359284 |pages=58–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a striking illustration of confirmation bias in the real world, Nickerson mentions numerological [[pyramidology]]: the practice of finding meaning in the proportions of the Egyptian pyramids.&lt;ref name= nick190 /&gt; There are many different length measurements that can be made of, for example, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] and many ways to combine or manipulate them. Hence it is almost inevitable that people who look at these numbers selectively will find superficially impressive correspondences, for example with the dimensions of the Earth.&lt;ref name="nick190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===
A distinguishing feature of [[science|scientific thinking]] is the search for falsifying as well as confirming evidence.&lt;ref name=nick194 /&gt; However, many times in the [[history of science]], scientists have resisted new discoveries by selectively interpreting or ignoring unfavorable data.&lt;ref name="nick194"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=192–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research has shown that the assessment of the quality of scientific studies seems to be particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias. It has been found several times that scientists rate studies that report findings consistent with their prior beliefs more favorably than studies reporting findings inconsistent with their previous beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hergovich 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koehler 1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Koehler|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahoney 1977"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahoney|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, assuming that the research question is relevant, the experimental design adequate and the data are clearly and comprehensively described, the found results should be of importance to the scientific community and should not be viewed prejudicially, regardless of whether they conform to current theoretical predictions.&lt;ref name="Mahoney 1977" /&gt;

In the context of scientific research, confirmation biases can sustain theories or research programs in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence;&lt;ref name="sutherland"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sutherland |first=Stuart |title=Irrationality |edition=2nd |publisher= Pinter and Martin |location=London |year=2007 |pages=95–103 |isbn=978-1-905177-07-3 |oclc=72151566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=Robert W. |first2=E.

Arguably, there is a whole field here with no powerful confirming data at all. But people want to believe, and so they find ways to believe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experimenter's confirmation bias can potentially affect which data are reported. Data that conflict with the experimenter's expectations may be more readily discarded as unreliable, producing the so-called [[publication bias|file drawer effect]]. To combat this tendency, scientific training teaches ways to prevent bias.&lt;ref name="shadish"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shadish |first=William R. |title= Critical Thinking in Psychology |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor1-last=Sternberg |editor2-first=Henry L. |editor2-last=Roediger&amp;nbsp;III |editor3-first=Diane F. |editor3-last=Halpern |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=49 |chapter=Critical Thinking in Quasi-Experimentation |isbn=978-0-521-60834-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Design of experiments|experimental design]] of [[randomized controlled trial]]s (coupled with their [[systematic review]]) aims to minimize sources of bias.&lt;ref name="shadish" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== In self-image ===
Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves.

=== In social media ===
In [[social media]], confirmation bias is amplified by the use of [[filter bubble]]s, or “algorithmic editing”, which shows individuals information that they are more likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles|title=Ted Talk: Beware Online "Filter Bubbles"|last=Pariser|first=Eli|date=May 2, 2011|website=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that confirmation bias is the reason why society can never escape from filter bubbles, because individuals are psychologically hardwired to seek information that agrees with our preexisting values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2016/11/forget-fake-news-facebook-real-filter-bubble-you|title=Forget fake news on Facebook – the real filter bubble is you|last=Self|first=Will|date=November 28, 2016|website=NewStatesman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have further argued that the mixture of the two is degrading [[democracy]]—claiming that this “algorithmic editing” removes diverse viewpoints and information—and that unless filter bubble algorithms are removed, voters will be unable to make fully informed political decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/did-facebooks-big-study-kill-my-filter-bubble-thesis/|title=Did Facebook's Big Study Kill My Filter Bubble Thesis?|last=Pariser|first=Eli|date=May 7, 2015|website=Wired|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd''''' [1944] KB 693 is an [[English tort law]] and [[English contract law|contract]] case, concerning the implied duty of an innkeeper to offer accommodation to a guest unless for just cause.

==Facts==
In 1943, [[Learie Constantine]], a black [[Trinidad|Trinidadian]] professional cricketer for the [[West Indies]], travelled to [[London]] to play for the Dominions team against England at [[Lord's]]. He and his family had a reservation to stay at the [[Imperial Hotel, London]] in [[Russell Square]]; he had been assured that he and his family would be welcomed and treated with the utmost respect. When they arrived at the hotel however, they were informed they could stay only one night on account of complaints about their presence made by white [[United States|American]] military servicemen who were also staying at the hotel. According to a newspaper report, the receptionist said "we won't have niggers in this hotel" because the Americans were staying.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' (20 June 1944) 2, col 5&lt;/ref&gt;

They were treated as outcasts, and Constantine was outraged. He claimed the hotel was in breach of contract. In Britain there was no statute that expressly outlawed racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100greatblackbritons.com/bios/lord_leary_constantine.html|title=Lord Leary Constantine|work=100greatblackbritons.com|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Constantine claimed that the hotel committed a tort, deriving from the common law principle that innkeepers must not refuse accommodation to guests without [[just cause]].

==Judgment==
[[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Mr Justice Birkett]] held that a [[legal right|right]] of Constantine had been violated. It was accepted that an innkeeper had a duty to provide reasonable accommodation and rejected the contention that when the hotel offered to lodge Constantine elsewhere, it was fulfilling that duty. Furthermore, even though Constantine suffered no pecuniary damage, the violation of the right was in principle capable of justifying a remedy. He was awarded the small sum of five guineas in damages.

{{Cquote|Before dealing with the main proposition of law advanced by Mr. Slade, I ought perhaps to deal with a further submission made by him: that, as Mr. Constantine went to the Bedford Hotel on the night in question, after leaving the Imperial Hotel, and was received and lodged there, the defendants were in the same position as though he had been received and lodged at the Imperial Hotel, and there had, therefore, been no refusal on which Mr. Constantine could rely. I reject this contention. Apart from the fact that the two hotels were in the same ownership, no further evidence was given as to the relationship between them, and the circumstances in which Mr. Constantine removed to the Bedford Hotel were such that it is impossible to find that the defendants did not refuse to receive and lodge Mr. Constantine. In ''[[Rothfield v. North British Railway Co.]]'', Lord Anderson said:&lt;ref&gt;1920 S.C. 805, 812.&lt;/ref&gt; "It was suggested that, as the pursuer might have obtained accommodation at another hotel in Edinburgh, he was not entitled to insist on obtaining it at the defenders' hotel, I do not agree. A traveller is, in my opinion, entitled to choose the hotel at which he desires to be a guest, and the defenders are not entitled to put a traveller, desiring to use their hotel, to the trouble and expense of finding another hotel." In ''[[Fell v. Knight]]'',&lt;ref&gt;8 M. &amp; W. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an innkeeper was only bound to provide reasonable accommodation, and the defendants through Mr. Slade said that, by offering accommodation at the Bedford Hotel, they had fulfilled their duty. I cannot accept this view. The claim before me is that the defendants refused to receive and lodge Mr. Constantine at the Imperial Hotel, and I hold it to be no answer that Mr. Constantine went to the Bedford Hotel under protest.

The first and main submission of the defendants was that the present action is an [[action on the case]], that the gist of an action on the case is the damage actually suffered and proved, and here no damage was suffered and no special damage is either alleged or proved. The [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster]], 2, 1285, authorizing the writ "in consimili casu" produced the writs which were classified under the common denomination "writs of trespass on the case," and the actions on the case based on them included - certainly from very early times - the present form of action before me. This action was based on the common law and on what was termed the custom of the realm. The distinction between the writ of trespass and the writ of trespass on the case would appear to be that trespass was the appropriate remedy for the direct invasion of a right by force either actual or implied by law, and case was the remedy for a wrong in which one at least of those elements was lacking. In an ordinary trespass, in which a forcible act directly caused damage to the plaintiff's person or property, the connexion between the act and the damage was usually obvious, and the damage was presumed, but in case the damage arising from the wrongful act was the gist of the action. Indeed, it has been said by the late Sir William Holdsworth that the constant need to inquire whether the damage complained of was the proximate consequence of the act of the defendant familiarized the courts with the comparatively modern conception of the idea of [[negligence]] in law, but, although it was the general rule that damage was the gist of an action on the case and although without question the action before me is an action on the case, it is said by Sir [[Patrick Hastings]] that that rule is by no means an inflexible rule and that in certain cases, of which he says this is one, damage will be presumed and that Mr. Constantine can recover.

It is to be observed that ''[[White's case]]'';&lt;ref&gt;(1558) 2 Dyer 158, b.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fell v. Knight]]''; and ''[[Hawthorn v. Hammond]]'';&lt;ref&gt;1 Car. &amp; Kir. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; were all actions on the case, and, incidentally, an indictment may be brought, as in ''[[Reg. v. Sprague]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1899) 63 J. P. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; which was brought so recently as 1891 at Surrey quarter sessions and shows that an innkeeper could be indicted, and, indeed, in that case was indicted, for not receiving a guest who was attired in what in those days was called rational dress. The great and celebrated case of ''[[Ashby v White]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2 Ld. Raym. 938; 3 Ld. Raym. 320; Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.), vol. I, 253; Howell's State Trials, vol. XIV, 695.&lt;/ref&gt; it must always be remembered, was itself an action on the case, and I observed in reading the very interesting argument in Howell's State Trials, vol. 14, that the Mr. Slade of that day used the very language that the Mr. Slade of this day used before me - that the action would not lie inasmuch as it was an action on the case, that damage was the gist of the action, and that no damage had been proved or could be presumed.

Reference was also made to the action for [[defamation]], which is, of course, an [[action on the case]], but in libel damage need not be proved. It is presumed. The action for slander is an action on the case. In certain specified cases, however, damage need not be proved, but is presumed. These matters go very far back into the [[history of law]]. In the beginning of the sixteenth century the common law courts began to take from the ecclesiastical courts most of the suits for defamation. The common law remedy was an action on the case and damage was undoubtedly the gist of the action, but the [[Court of Star Chamber]] regarded defamation as a crime, and, when the Court of Star Chamber was abolished, the law of defamation included these two separate and divergent parts derived from the common law and from the Court of Star Chamber. In slander, too, by the middle of the seventeenth century the categories that we know today so well, in which words are actionable per se had been established, the imputation of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment, the imputation of a contagious disease, or the imputation of unfitness for carrying on a trade or profession. The first of these categories arose from an attempt to distinguish the spheres of jurisdiction of the common law courts and the ecclesiastical courts: the others, most probably, on the obvious tendency of the imputation itself to cause damage. In libel, after the Restoration, the courts held that libel was a wrongful act from which damage could be presumed, but in slander no extension of the settled categories is permitted to this day. In ''[[Jones v. Jones]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A. C. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Wrenbury, in his speech in the House of Lords, said:&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A. C. 506&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that the imputation is a gross and grievous attack upon personal character is not of itself enough. For otherwise a statute would not have been necessary to enable a woman or a girl to sue for slander upon her chastity. The imputation must be such and the state of facts such, not as that a judge would necessarily or reasonably presume or infer damage, but as that judges in the past have presumed or inferred damage. This involves a confession which I fear must be made, that the law of slander rests not upon any principle whose elasticity will admit new cases, but upon artificial distinctions. An artificial and arbitrary rule is not a principle. The plaintiff must for success bring his case within the very limited class of cases in which slander has been held actionable. He must show that the imputation is such and the state of facts is such as that a presumption of damage as matter of law has been made in the past under like circumstances. I am of course here speaking, and throughout this opinion I am speaking, of cases in which damage is not proved."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a most exhaustive discussion of the artificial law of slander Viscount Haldane's speech in that case may be referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A.C. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact, therefore, that libel is an action on the case and yet damage is to be presumed is based on the historical development of the law of defamation, as is the highly artificial position of the law of slander, and it affords me little help in the question which I have to decide today.

Reference was also made in the course of the argument, both by Mr. Slade and by Sir Patrick Hastings, to the action for [[malicious prosecution]]. It was the development of the action on the case, founded on the statutory writ of [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]], which gave rise to the tort of malicious prosecution. Holt C.J., defines the law in ''[[Savile v. Roberts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1698) 1 Ld. Raym. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be noted that, among other things, he laid down that the plaintiff must prove one of three kinds of damage: (1.) damage to his fair fame; (2.) damage to his person; (3.) damage to his property. The ground of the action was not conspiracy, but the damage, and as a rule no action will lie for bringing a civil action maliciously, but the bringing of a prosecution maliciously may give rise to an action on the case if special damage is proved. In ''[[Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v. Eyre]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1883) 11 Q. B. D. 674, 689&lt;/ref&gt; Bowen L.J., said: "The reason why, to my mind, the bringing of an action under our present rules of procedure and under our present law, even if it is brought without reasonable or probable cause and with malice, gives rise to no ground of complaint appears to me easily to be seen upon referring to the doctrine laid down by Holt C.J., in ''[[Savile v. Roberts]]''." Then he refers to the three matters which I have mentioned as to the kinds of damage. Bowen L.J., continued: "It is clear that Holt C.J., considered one of those three heads of damage necessary to support an action for malicious prosecution. To apply this test to any action that can be conceived under our present mode of procedure and under our present law, it seems to me that no mere bringing of an action, although it is brought maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause, will give rise to an action for malicious prosecution." In a passage which I have had continually before me in considering this case he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Although every judge of the present day will be swift to do [[justice]] and slow to allow himself as to matters of justice to be encumbered with either precedents or technicalities, still every wise judge who sits to administer justice must feel the greatest respect for the [[wisdom]] of the past, and the wisdom of the past presents us with no decisive authority for the broad proposition in its entirety which the counsel for the plaintiff company have put forward. But although an action does not give rise to an action for malicious prosecution, inasmuch as it does not necessarily or naturally involve damage, there are legal proceedings which do necessarily and naturally involve that damage; and when proceedings of that kind have been taken falsely and maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, then, inasmuch as an injury has been done, the law gives a remedy. Such proceedings are indictments - I do not say every indictment, but I mean all indictments involving either scandal to reputation or the possible loss of liberty to the person, that is, all ordinary indictments for ordinary offences. In its very nature the presentation or the prosecution of an indictment involves damage, which cannot be afterwards repaired by the failure of the proceedings, to the fair fame of the person assailed, and for that reason, as it seems to me, the law considers that to present and prosecute an indictment falsely and without reasonable or probable cause is a foundation for a subsequent action for a malicious prosecution."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mr. Slade further relied on the decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1919] A. C. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; clearly an authority of very great importance. It dealt with most interesting questions about the tort of [[Champerty and maintenance|maintenance]]. In the middle ages the offence of maintenance was treated, as was defamation and conspiracy, both as a crime and as a tort, but in modem times it came to be regarded as a tort rather than a crime. In defamation and conspiracy the civil action was an action on the case in which damage was the gist of the action, but in maintenance it appears to have been "doubtful whether the action was not an action in the nature of trespass, in which nominal damages could be recovered." In ''[[Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld]]'', two very closely connected questions were decided. The first was whether an action for maintenance would lie in the absence of proof of special damage, which is mutatis mutandis the question which I have to decide in the present case, and the second question, closely allied, was whether the success of the maintained litigation was a bar to the action. The decision of the majority of the House of Lords - Lord Finlay L.C., Lord Shaw and Lord Phillimore - was that the action would not lie in the absence of proof of special damage, and Mr. Slade pressed that decision on me in this case. Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson dissented, and Sir Patrick Hastings said that, although I was bound by the majority decision if this were a matter of maintenance, the principles enunciated by the dissentient lords were applicable to the facts before me. The dissentient lords thought that, as maintenance was admittedly illegal, the law should give a remedy in tort for nominal damages as in the case of trespass and libel since, as Lord Atkinson said, "the mere invasion of the plaintiff's legal right imports damage and is sufficient to maintain the action." If conduct be illegal, or, indeed, criminal, it does not necessarily follow that an action in tort for nominal damages will lie. If the action for maintenance is not to be regarded as an action on the case analogous to trespass, no doubt an action would lie for nominal damages, but the majority of the House of Lords treated the action as an action on the case and applied the general rule in that case. On the second question the majority of the House of Lords - Lord Finlay L.C., and Viscount Haldane, and Lord Atkinson - held that the success of the maintained litigation was not a bar to the right of action for maintenance. This is, if one may say so with the very deepest respect, in apparent conflict with the decision on the first question, for, if the maintained litigation was just and succeeded and is not a bar to the action, the plaintiff could scarcely claim anything but nominal damages, and, according to the answer to the first question, the action for nominal damages will not lie. There is a passage in the speech of Lord Finlay which I think is of importance in the present case. He said: "The action for maintenance is, in my opinion, one which can be sustained only if special damage has been occasioned to the plaintiff by the maintenance. The maintenance may be punishable as an offence, but to give a right of action the commission of the offence must have caused damage to the plaintiff. Of course, if a right has been infringed, as in ''[[Ashby v. White]]'', where a man was deprived of his right to vote, no proof of damage is necessary. As Lord Holt expressed it, 'an injury imports a damage, when a man is thereby hindred of his right'." Lord Finlay, speaking of damages, said: "As there was no damage in the present case, I am of opinion that the action for maintenance must fail and that judgment must therefore be entered for the defendants on this head of claim. I think it would be futile to send the case down for a new trial, even if it were regarded as one in which for the maintenance of the action proof of damage is not necessary. We have all the facts before us and it is clear that, even on this view, only nominal damages could be recovered. Any verdict giving substantial damages on these facts would be perverse and would be set aside. If then the action for maintenance were to be regarded as one for the invasion of a right, to sustain which special damage is not necessary, the proper course would be to give judgment for the plaintiff for nominal damages. But, in my opinion, this head of claim fails altogether." I need not cite other than a passage from the dissentient judgment of Viscount Haldane which shows quite clearly that what he was there doing was to say that in the action for maintenance the proper principle to be applied was the principle which is enunciated by Holt C.J., in ''[[Ashby v. White]]''. He said: "As Lord Holt showed in ''Ashby v. White'', every violation of a right imports damage in contemplation of law. This principle applies whether the right arises out of a contract, as in ''[[Marzetti v. Williams]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1830) 1 B. and Ad. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; or out of a tort, as in ''[[Embrey v. Owen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;6 Ex. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The damage may be substantial, but may also amount to what is merely nominal." A little later, after quoting Parke B., he said: "But where the right is, as it often is, an absolute right the doctrine laid down by Lord Holt in ''Ashby v. White'' applies, and every infringement of such an absolute right gives a claim to nominal damages, even though all actual loss or injury is disproved." At the end of his opinion Viscount Haldane said: "Under these circumstances I think he was entitled to no more than nominal damages for the violation of his right, and that the jury ought to have been directed to this effect. I think that justice will be done if judgment on the claim for maintenance is entered for him for merely nominal damages, unless the jury on a new trial think that exemplary damages should be given. No direction suggesting such damages should be given." It is clear, therefore, on that case that the real point to be decided was with what class of case the House of Lords was dealing, the majority saying that it was an action founded on case, in which special damage is essential, and Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson saying that it was a claim which was akin to the action in ''Ashby v. White''.

The case before me is admittedly in the form of an action on the case, but Sir Patrick Hastings' main contention was that this was a case in which the law will presume damage, and that the decision in ''Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld.'' does not affect the matter. He relied very strongly on ''Ashby v. White'' which is reported very fully in Howell's State Trials, where the contentions before the court are very clearly set out and discussed. In that case Holt C.J. said: "The single question in this case is, whether, if a free burgess of a corporation, who has an undoubted right to give his vote in the election of a burgess to serve in Parliament, be refused and hindered to give it by the officer, an action on the case will lie against such officer? I am of opinion that judgment ought to be given in this case for the plaintiff." Later comes the famous passage on which Sir Patrick Hastings relied and which was the passage cited by the dissentient lords in ''Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld.'' Holt C.J. said: "If the plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to vindicate and maintain it, and a remedy if he is injured in the exercise or enjoyment of it; and, indeed, it is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy; for want of right and want of remedy are reciprocal." .... "And I am of opinion that this action on the case is a proper action. My brother Powell indeed thinks that an action upon the case is not maintainable, because there is no hurt or damage to the plaintiff; but surely every injury imports a damage, though it does not cost the party one farthing, and it is impossible to prove the contrary; for a damage is not merely [[pecuniary]], but an injury imports a damage, when a man is thereby hindred of his right."

Is the principle of that case to be applied to the facts of the present matter? In ''Embrey v. Owen'', Parke B. said: "It was very ably argued before us by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs had a right to the full flow of the water in its natural course and abundance, as an incident to their property in the land through which it flowed; and that any abstraction of the water, however inconsiderable, by another riparian proprietor, and though productive of no actual damage, would be actionable, because it was an injury to a right and, if continued, would be the foundation of a claim of adverse right in that proprietor. We by no means dispute the truth of this proposition, with respect to every description of right. Actual perceptible damage is not indispensable as the foundation of an action; it is sufficient to show the violation of a right, in which case the law will presume damage; injuria sine damno is actionable, as was laid down in the case of ''Ashby v. White'' by Lord Holt, and in many subsequent cases, which are all referred to, and the truth of the proposition powerfully enforced in a very able judgment of the late Story J. in ''Webb v. Portland Manufacturing Co.''&lt;ref&gt;55. (1838) 3 Sumner Rep. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case cited, Story J. said: "But I am not able to understand how it can correctly be said, in a legal sense, that an action will not lie, even in the case of a wrong or violation of a right, unless it is followed by some perceptible damage which can be established as a matter of fact; in other words, that ''injuria sine damno'' is not actionable. On the contrary, from my earliest reading, I have considered it laid up among the very elements of the common law that, wherever there is a wrong, there is a remedy to redress it; that every injury imports damage in the nature of it; and, if no other damage is established, the party injured is entitled to a verdict for nominal damages."

The last case to which I need refer is ''[[Rothfield v. North British Railway Co.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1920 S. C. 805.&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Rothfield brought a claim against the railway company for refusing to allow him to stay at their hotel, the North British Station Hotel, at Edinburgh. Lord Anderson, on the hearing of the case, awarded him on the first hearing one guinea damages. There were further matters, but, finally, it was decided by the full court that the defendants were entitled to refuse to receive Mr. Rothfield in their hotel. From the report it appears that: "On November 8, 1918, the Lord Ordinary (Lord Anderson), after a hearing in the Procedure Roll, being of opinion that he could decide the case without any inquiry into the facts, found and declared in terms of the declaratory conclusions of the summons, and found the pursuer entitled to damages, which he assessed at the sum of one guinea." The form of the action there was (a) for a declaration, and (b) for damages, and the damages that were claimed were stated to be "for payment by the defenders of the sum of 105l. in the name of damages." The judgment of Lord Anderson is most exhaustive and instructive on both the English and the Scots law. The matter came a second time before the Lord Ordinary when he affirmed his previous decision. Then the Lord Justice Clerk said: "He therefore" - the pursuer - "raised the present action to have his rights declared," and later: "The origin and development of this branch of the law have been different in England and Scotland. In England it is apparently based on the 'custom of England,' and has been the subject of many judicial determinations. In Scotland it had its origin in statutory provisions in the fifteenth century, and has received little elucidation by judicial utterances, so far as the question raised in the present case is concerned." Again: "But, if I may take the judgment of Lord Alverstone in ''[[Browne v. Brandt]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1902] 1 K. B. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; as correctly stating the law of England, there does not seem to be much, if any, difference in the result between the laws of England and of Scotland on this subject." I cite passages from this case because they may be helpful as showing what other minds felt on similar facts. The Lord Justice Clerk also said: "Further, if members of the public have rights as to accommodation in an hotel, .... which I think they have, and if the keeper of an hotel is subject to the liabilities before referred to, then I am inclined to think that an action of declarator" - which is similar to our action for a declaration - "may be competently brought by a traveller, who desires to establish the existence of these rights and liabilities, against an hotel keeper who refuses to recognise them, when the traveller legitimately and properly asks that they should be recognised and accorded to him, or, in the appropriate circumstances, puts forward his claim to have these rights declared. I am further inclined to be of opinion that the denial of such rights and liabilities, when legitimately and properly required to be recognised and observed by an individual traveller, would justify an appropriate action of declarator and damages, though the damages awarded might, of course, be merely nominal. I am not satisfied that a declaratory conclusion is an essential preliminary to a conclusion for damages in such an action." Lord Dundas said: "The pursuer concludes for 105l. in name of damages. A claim of that nature must, I think, be supported by averment and proof of some actual legal wrong sustained by the pursuer, for which the defenders are responsible." Then he discussed whether there was in fact any legal wrong and concluded: "A general denial of the pursuer's statement of his alleged rights does not, in my judgment, constitute the infliction of a legal wrong sounding in damages." Lord Salvesen said: "There is, therefore, no evidence upon which we are entitled judicially to proceed of the pursuer having suffered any legal wrong from which a claim of damages, however nominal, might emerge." Lord Ormidale said: "In this action the pursuer seeks to recover damages. He avers that he made application as a traveller for, and was refused, admission to the defenders' hotel, and so suffered a legal wrong. In my opinion, he may be held on one occasion to have made such an application and to have been refused." He went on to deal with the facts and added: "Accordingly, it seems to me that the pursuer did - apart from the question whether the defenders had good ground for refusing him - on this occasion suffer a legal wrong sounding in damages."

With the greatest desire loyally to follow authority which is binding on me, I find that I have yet to decide the express point in this case without any express authority to guide me. Having given the matter the fullest consideration, I hold this action by Mr. Constantine to be maintainable without proof of special damage. His right, I think, is founded on the common law. That right I found was violated. The law affords him a remedy, and the injury which he has suffered imports damage. I think that the principles of the decision in ''[[Ashby v. White]]'' apply to this case. It only remains for me to say that I was urged by Sir Patrick Hastings to award exemplary or substantial damages, because of the circumstances in which the denial of the right took place when Mr. Constantine suffered, as I find that he did suffer, much unjustifiable humiliation and distress, but on the authorities I do not feel that I can accede to that submission, having regard to the exact nature of this action and the form in which it comes before me. My conclusion is that I must give judgment for Mr. Constantine for nominal damages only, and I, therefore, award him the sum of five guineas.}}

==Significance==
The ruling did not end the colour bar in some British hotels and other public establishments. Constantine later wrote ''Colour Bar'' (1954). The book dealt with racial prejudice in Britain. In 1947, Constantine was appointed as a Member of the [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]]. The [[Hotel Proprietors Act 1956]] extended the law against discrimination in statute to all hotels, also those offering food and drink. But it was not until after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] in the USA that the Labour Party committed to a general statute against [[racial discrimination]] with the passage of the [[Race Relations Act 1965]]. This was further extended to all public services and employment by the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]. The law is now found in the [[Equality Act 2010]]. 

Cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] drew one of his more famous cartoons attacking the hotel's treatment of Learie Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/record/LSE3344 |title=Imperial welcome |work=cartoons.ac.uk |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} "The colours represent creative energy, and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece, never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''constructed language''' (sometimes called a '''conlang''') is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]] are, instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], consciously devised for communication between intelligent beings, most commonly for use by humanoids. Constructed languages may also be referred to as '''artificial''', '''planned''' or '''invented languages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&amp;_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases [[fictional language|fictional languages]].  There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [[communication]] (see [[international auxiliary language]] and [[code]]), to give [[fiction]] or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]], for [[artistic language|artistic creation]], and for [[language game]]s. 

The expression ''planned language'' is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective ''artificial'', as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [[Esperanto culture]], the term [[language planning]] means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction.  The term ''glossopoeia'' &lt;!--, coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], {see talk page; can anyone cite a use by Tolkien? Sarah Higley uses the word but does not attribute its coinage to him.}--&gt; is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [[artistic language]]s.&lt;ref name="higley2007"&gt;Sarah L. Higley: ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language''.  Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2001 found 4570 speakers of [[Esperanto]], 10 of [[Romanid]], two each of [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and one each of [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Mundolinco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load2_39_1.html Ethnic affiliation, attachment of cultures, languages and language systems Hungarian statistical office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian census of 2010 found 992 speakers of Esperanto, nine of Ido, one of Edo and no speakers of [[Slovio]] or Interlingua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sezonoj.ru/2011/12/censo/ Russian census (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned, constructed, artificial==
The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [[Interlingua]] consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed.  Similarly, [[Latino sine flexione]] (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [[inflection]]s have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [[Esperanto]] and [[Esperantido]]s also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [[François Rabelais]], for instance, stated: "C'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle; les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples."  (''It's an abuse to say that we have a natural language; languages are arbitrary and conventions of peoples by institution.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[François Rabelais]], Œvres complètes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973), cited in Claude Piron, ''Le Defi des Langues'' (L'Harmattan, 1994) {{ISBN|2-7384-2432-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial language can also refer to a language that emerges naturally out of experimental studies within the framework of [[artificial language|artificial language evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Furthermore, fictional and experimental languages can be naturalistic in that they are meant to sound natural and have realistic amounts of irregularity. If a naturalistic conlang is derived ''a posteriori'' from a real-world natural language, a real-world reconstructed [[proto-language]] (such as [[Vulgar Latin]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) or a fictional proto-language, it should imitate natural processes of [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] change. In contrast with Interlingua, they are not usually intended for easy learning or communication, and most artlangers do not consider Interlingua to be naturalistic in the sense in which this term is used in artlang criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a naturalistic fictional language tends to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [[irregular verbs]] and nouns and complicated phonological processes.

==Overview==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*''[[Engineered language]]s'' (''engelangs'' {{IPA|/ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/}}), further subdivided into logical languages (''loglangs''), [[philosophical language]]s and [[experimental language]]s; devised for the purpose of experimentation in [[logic]], [[philosophy]], or [[linguistics]];
*''[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s'' (''auxlangs'') devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language);
*''[[Artistic language]]s'' (''artlangs'') devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, ''just for fun''; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs.

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html The "Conlang Triangle"] by Raymond Brown.  Accessed 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are "200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|who speak Esperanto as a first language]]". A member of the [[Klingon Language Institute]], [[d'Armond Speers]], attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [[Klingon language|Klingon]] speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.08/mustread.html?pg=8 Gavin Edwards: ''Babble On Revisited'', Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [[Modern Hebrew]] and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [[Hebrew]], such as [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] following a general [[Sephardic]] pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [[Israel]] was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [[Yiddish]] and other languages spoken by revivalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Let my people know!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916161700/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esperanto]] as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in creating [[Láadan]], a feminist language&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt; embodied in her [[feminist science fiction]] series ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say "Elgin, you've got it all wrong!" and construct some other "women's language" to replace it."  {{cite web|title=Interview With Suzette Haden Elgin |last=Glatzer |first=Jenna |work= |url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612005757/http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A constructed language could also be used to ''restrict'' thought, as in [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], or to ''simplify'' thought, as in [[Toki Pona]]. In contrast, linguists such as [[Steven Pinker]] argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others.  An example can be taken from the way various [[programming language]]s make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [[Basic English]] first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [[regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see [[propaedeutic value of Esperanto]]).

[[Codes for constructed languages]] include the [[ISO 639-2]] "&lt;tt&gt;[[Codes for constructed languages|art]]&lt;/tt&gt;" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [[ISO 639]] language codes (e.g. "&lt;tt&gt;eo&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;epo&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Esperanto]], "jbo" for [[Lojban]], "&lt;tt&gt;ia&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ina&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Interlingua]], "&lt;tt&gt;tlh&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and "&lt;tt&gt;io&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ido&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).

==''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' languages==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

An ''a priori'' constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an ''a posteriori'' language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' depending on which linguistic factors of them are observed.

===''A priori'' language===

An ''a priori'' language (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a priori'', "from the former") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some ''a priori'' languages are designed to be [[international auxiliary language]]s that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for ''a posteriori'' languages. Others, known as [[philosophical language|philosophical]] or [[taxonomic languages]], try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary.

====Experimental====
There have been many languages constructed to test linguistic hypotheses (such as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]) and/or to explore innovative or invented linguistic features. They are therefore necessarily designed with ''a priori'' features. Examples include [[Ithkuil]], [[Kotava]], [[Lojban]] (and its predecessor [[Loglan]], both of which are also schematic), and even the fictional-setting [[Láadan]].

====Artistic====
Most [[artistic language]]s, i.e. those created for amusement or to serve as natural languages of fictional worlds, are largely ''a priori'' in both vocabulary and grammar. Among classical "fictional natural languages" are [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the science-fiction franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|the languages created]] by fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Other examples include [[Dothraki]] and [[Valyrian]] from ''[[Game of Thrones]]', '[[The 100 (TV series)|Trigedasleng]] from [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]], [[Atlantean language|Atlantean]] from ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', [[Kēlen]] by Sylvia Sotomayor and [[aUI (language)|aUI]] by W. John Weilgart. [[Láadan]] is both experimental and artistic.

===''A posteriori'' language===
An '''''a posteriori'' language''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a posteriori'', "from the latter"), according to [[Louis Couturat]], is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [[controlled language|controlled versions]] of existing languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. In distinguishing whether the language is ''a priori'' or ''a posteriori'', the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. They may be controlled, naturalistic or schematic.

====Controlled====
A [[controlled language]] is a version of a [[natural language]] with improvements intended to make it easier to learn and to use, such as reduced vocabulary, simplified grammar, etc. These include:
*[[Latino sine flexione]]
*Controlled versions of English:
**[[Basic English]] 
**[[Special English]]
**[[Globish (Gogate)|Globish]]

====Naturalistic====
Naturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate the grammar and vocabulary of a particular group of related languages within a [[language family|family]], thus being potentially [[zonal constructed language|zonal]], i.e. auxiliary between speakers of these languages.
*[[Occidental language|Occidental]] (also called Interlingue)
*[[Interlingua de IALA]]
*[[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]
*[[Folkspraak]]
*[[Lingua Franca Nova]]

===Schematic===
A constructed language is considered schematic when it features a more original grammar, which is usually precise and regular to avoid ambiguities and other obstacles to an easy study, and a vocabulary coming from languages of different families, to make it as recognizable as possible for potential [[international auxiliary language|international auxiliary]] purposes. For that they can be described as half ''a priori'', half ''a posteriori''. There have been many attempts of developing languages with these characteristics, including:
*[[Volapük]]
*[[Esperanto]] and the [[Esperantido]]s:
**[[Ido (language)|Ido]]
**[[Mundolinco]]
*[[Lojban]] (and [[Loglan]])
*[[Glosa]] (and [[Interglossa]])
*[[Lingwa de planeta]]
*[[Sambahsa]]
*[[Toki Pona]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]

==History==

===Ancient linguistic experiments===
Grammatical speculation dates from [[Classical Antiquity]], appearing for instance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice&amp;nbsp;... to the thing". [[Athenaeus]] of Naucratis, in Book III of [[Deipnosophistae]], tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created [[neologism]]s like ''menandros'' "virgin" (from ''menei'' "waiting" and ''andra'' "husband"), ''menekratēs'' "pillar" (from ''menei'' "it remains in one place" and ''kratei'' "it is strong"), and ''ballantion'' "javelin" (from ''balletai enantion'' "thrown against someone"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are ''parthenos'', ''stulos'', and ''akon''. [[Alexarchus of Macedon]], the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier," a barber as a "mortal-shaver," a drachma as "worked silver"...and a herald as an ''aputēs'' [from ''ēputa'' "loud-voiced"]. "He once wrote something...to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [[Apollo|Pythian god]] could make sense of it." While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]]), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [[Pāṇini]] constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

===Early constructed languages===
[[File:68r.jpg|thumb|Page 68r of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.]]

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [[Irish language|Irish]] work [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] claims that [[Fénius Farsaid]] visited [[Shinar]] after the [[confusion of tongues]], and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create ''in Bérla tóbaide'' ("the selected language"), which he named [[Old Irish|''Goídelc'']]—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [[Lingua Ignota]], recorded in the 12th century by St. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of private mystical [[cant (language)|cant]] (see also [[Enochian|language of angels]]). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [[Balaibalan]], invented in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. The first [[Christian]] project for an ideal language is outlined in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', where he searches for the ideal [[Italian language|Italian]] vernacular suited for literature. [[Ramon Llull]]'s ''[[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ars Magna]]'' was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [[combinatorics]] on a given set of concepts.{{Vague|date=October 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} During [[the Renaissance]], Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications. The [[Voynich manuscript]] may be an example of this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Perfecting language===
Renaissance interest in [[Ancient Egypt]], notably the discovery of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], and first encounters with the [[Chinese script]] directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in ''Steganographia'' and ''Polygraphia'', attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [[Magical thinking|magical]] languages was continued by the [[Rosicrucians]] and [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (like [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[Enochian]]). [[Jakob Boehme]] in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (''Natursprache'') of the senses.

[[Musical language]]s from the Renaissance were tied up with [[mysticism]], magic and [[alchemy]], sometimes also referred to as the [[language of the birds]]. The [[Solresol]] project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.

===17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages===
The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*[[Francis Lodwick]]'s ''A Common Writing'' (1647) and ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'' (1652)
* Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s ''Ekskybalauron'' (1651) and ''Logopandecteision''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/urquhart/index.html|title=Logopandecteision|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1652)
* [[George Dalgarno]]'s ''Ars signorum'', 1661
* [[John Wilkins]]' ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language'', 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression.  [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] had a similar purpose for his ''lingua generalis'' of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [[binary calculus]]. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.  Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were [[Pasigraphy|pasigraphies]], or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.&lt;ref name="einstein1884"&gt;[[Leopold Einstein]], "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [[Ro (language)|Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (artificial language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt;).

===19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages===
{{main article|International auxiliary language}}
Already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]] in the article on ''Langue'' wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in 1887 by [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]], and its [[Esperantido|descendants]].  [[Interlingua]], the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] published its [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] and an accompanying [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|grammar]]. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [[Eurolengo]], which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[[Loglan]] (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern ''a priori'' languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[[Robot Interaction Language]] (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [[speech recognition]] algorithms.

===Artlangs===
{{main article|Artistic language}}
Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. 

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [[Artistic language|artistic languages]] begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007" /&gt;  ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' (1912) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] developed a family of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "''[[A Secret Vice]]''" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [[International auxiliary language|IAL]] rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which ''suggests'' the existence of a complete language, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]] ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]])'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]] ([[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]])'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the ''[[Myst]]'' series of computer adventure games.

==Modern conlang organizations==
Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as ''Glossopoeic Quarterly'', ''Taboo Jadoo'', and ''The Journal of Planned Languages''.&lt;ref name="rosta2007"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/ge/bhaelvhua/vhurtaethuan.html "How did you find out that there were other conlangers?"] Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. &lt;!-- to do: find exact date of Conlang/Auxlang split --&gt;  In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as ''Vortpunoj''&lt;ref name="vortpunoj"&gt;[http://revo.bierfaristo.com/vortpunoj.html Archives of ''Vortpunoj''] at Steve Brewer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Model Languages''.  The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [[List of language inventors|conlangers]] with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [[translation relay]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet] by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616085932/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php |date=June 16, 2005 }}, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own terminology.  Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

More recently founded online communities include the [[Zompist]] Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board.  Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.&lt;ref name="jarrett2001"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/bhe/gherque/chivirchein.html "Update mailing list statistics—FINAL"], Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.&lt;ref name="avg_age"&gt;[http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 "Average life of a conlang"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035040/http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 |date=2011-06-14 }} thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;br/&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/wu/seifi/phirqondal.html "Average life of a conlang"] thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread)&lt;/ref&gt;{{portal|Constructed languages}}

In [[social dynamics]], '''critical mass''' is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth. The term is borrowed from nuclear physics and in that field it refers to the amount of a substance needed to sustain a chain reaction.

Social factors influencing critical mass may involve the size, interrelatedness and level of communication in a society or one of its subcultures. Another is [[social stigma]], or the possibility of public advocacy due to such a factor.

Critical mass may be closer to majority consensus in political circles, where the most effective position is more often that held by the majority of people in society. In this sense, small changes in public consensus can bring about swift changes in political consensus, due to the majority-dependent effectiveness of certain ideas as tools of political debate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Critical mass is a concept used in a variety of contexts, including [[Critical mass|physics]], [[group dynamics]], [[politics]], [[public opinion]], and [[technology]].

==History==
The concept of critical mass was originally created by game theorist [[Thomas Schelling]] and sociologist [[Mark Granovetter]] to explain the actions and behaviors of a wide range of people and phenomenon. The concept was first established (although not explicitly named) in Schelling's essay about racial segregation in neighborhoods, published in 1971 in the Journal of Mathematical Sociology,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schelling, "Dynamic models of segregation", Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and later refined in his book, ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'', published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas C. Micromotives and Macrobehavior. New York: Norton, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He did use the term "critical density" with regard to pollution in his "On the Ecology of Micromotives".&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas C. "On the Ecology of Micromotives," The Public Interest, No. 25, Fall 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Granovetter, in his essay "Threshold models of collective behavior", published in the [[American Journal of Sociology]] in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 1978 | title = Threshold Models of Collective Behavior | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 83 | issue = 6| page = 1420 | doi=10.1086/226707}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked to solidify the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Krauth, Brian. "Notes for a History of the Critical Mass Model." SFU.ca. Web. 29 November 2011. https://www.sfu.ca/~bkrauth/papers/critmass.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Everett Rogers later cites them both in his important work ''Diffusion of Innovations'', in which critical mass plays an important role.

===Predecessors===
The concept of critical mass had existed before it entered a sociology context. It was an established concept in [[medicine]], specifically [[epidemiology]], since the 1920s, as it helped to explain the spread of illnesses.

It had also been a present, if not solidified, idea in the study of consumer habits and economics, especially in [[General Equilibrium Theory]]. In his papers, Schelling quotes the well-known [[The Market for Lemons|"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"]] paper written in 1970 by George Akerlof.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, George A. The Market for "lemons": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism. 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Granovetter cited the [[Nash Equilibrium]] game in his papers.

Finally, [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s essay, "Bandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of election predictions", published in 1954   in [[Public Opinion Quarterly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuran | first1 = Timur | year = 1987 | title = Chameleon Voters and Public Choice | url = | journal = Public Choice | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 53–78 | doi=10.1007/bf00115654}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as a predecessor to the concept we now know as critical mass.

==Logic of collective action and common good==
Critical mass and the theories behind it help us to understand aspects of humans as they act and interact in a larger social setting. Certain theories, such as [[Mancur Olson]]'s [[Logic of Collective Action]]&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Mancur. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1971. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Garrett Hardin]]'s [[Tragedy of the Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1968 | title = The Tragedy of the Commons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 162 | issue = 3859| pages = 1243–248 | doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 | pmid=5699198 | last1 = Hardin | first1 = G| bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1243H}}&lt;/ref&gt; work to help us understand why humans do or adopt certain things which are beneficial to them, or, more importantly, why they do not. Much of this reasoning has to do with individual interests trumping that which is best for the collective whole, which may not be obvious at the time.

Oliver, Marwell, and Teixeira tackle this subject in relation to critical theory in a 1985 article published in the [[American Journal of Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oliver | first1 = P. | last2 = Marwell | first2 = G. | last3 = Teixeira | first3 = R. | year = 1985 | title = A Theory of Critical Mass: I. Interdependence, Group Heterogeneity, and the Production of Collective Action | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 552–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their essay, they define that action in service of a public good as "[[collective action]]". "Collective Action" is beneficial to all, regardless of individual contribution. By their definition, then, "critical mass" is the small segment of a societal system that does the work or action required to achieve the common good. The "Production Function" is the correlation between resources, or what individuals give in an effort to achieve public good, and the achievement of that good. Such function can be decelerating, where there is less utility per unit of resource, and in such a case, resource can taper off. On the other hand, the function can be accelerating, where the more resources that are used the bigger the payback. "Heterogeneity" is also important to the achievement of a common good. Variations (heterogeneity) in the value individuals put on a common good or the effort and resources people give is beneficial, because if certain people stand to gain more, they are willing to give or pay more.

==Gender politics==

Critical mass theory in gender politics and collective political action is defined as the critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kanter | first = Rosabeth Moss | author-link = Rosabeth Moss Kanter | title = Some effects of proportions on group life: skewed sex ratios and responses to token women | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–990  for the [[University of Chicago Press]] | date = March 1977 | jstor = 2777808 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1086/226425}} [http://www.nhh.no/Files/Filer/adm/personal/Likestilling/MossKanter.pdf Pdf from Norges Handelshøyskole (NHH), the Norwegian School of Economics.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128184313/http://www.nhh.no/files/filer/adm/personal/likestilling/mosskanter.pdf |date=28 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number has been placed at 30%, before women are able to make a substantial difference in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | author-link = Drude Dahlerup | title = From a small to a large minority: women in Scandinavian politics | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 275–297 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x | date = December 1988 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | author-link = Drude Dahlerup | title = The story of the theory of critical mass | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 511–522 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X0624114X | date = December 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X0624114X | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research suggests lower numbers of women working together in legislature can also affect political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Childs | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Krook | first2 = Mona Lena | title = Should feminists give up on critical mass?

==Interactive media==
While critical mass can be applied to many different aspects of sociodynamics, it becomes increasingly applicable to innovations in interactive media such as the telephone, fax, or email. With other non-interactive innovations, the dependence on other users was generally sequential, meaning that the early adopters influenced the later adopters to use the innovation. However, with interactive media, the interdependence was reciprocal, meaning both users influenced each other. This is due to the fact that interactive media have high [[network effect]],&lt;ref name="Rogers, Everett M 2003"&gt;Rogers, Everett M. Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where in the value and utility of a good or service increases the more users it has. Thus, the increase of adopters and quickness to reach critical mass can therefore be faster and more intense with interactive media, as can the rate at which previous users discontinue their use. The more people that use it, the more beneficial it will be, thus creating a type of snowball effect, and conversely, if users begin to stop using the innovation, the innovation loses utility, thus pushing more users to discontinue their use.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title= Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media: Universal Access, Interdependence and Diffusion, 14:491 |author=M. Lynne Markus|year=1987 |publisher=Communication Research |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markus essay===
In [[M. Lynne Markus]]' essay in ''Communication Research'' entitled "Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; several propositions are made that try to predict under what circumstances interactive media is most likely to achieve critical mass and reach [[universal access]], a "common good" using Oliver, ''et al''.'s terminology. One proposition states that such media's existence is all or nothing, where in if universal access is not achieved, then, eventually, use will discontinue. Another proposition suggests that a media's ease of use and inexpensiveness, as well as its utilization of an "active notification capability" will help it achieve universal access. The third proposition states that the heterogeneity, as discussed by Oliver, et al. is beneficial, especially if users are dispersed over a larger area, thus necessitating interactivity via media. Fourth, it is very helpful to have highly sought-after individuals to act as early adopters, as their use acts as incentive for later users. Finally, Markus posits that interventions, both monetarily and otherwise, by governments, businesses, or groups of individuals will help a media reach its critical mass and achieve universal access.

===Fax machine example===
[[File:Samfax.jpg|thumb|300px|A fax machine]]
An example put forth by Rogers in ''Diffusion of Innovations'' was that of the [[fax|fax machine]], which had been around for almost 150 years before it became popular and widely used. It had existed in various forms and for various uses, but with more advancements in the technology of faxes, including the use of existing phone lines to transmit information, coupled with falling prices in both machines and cost per fax, the fax machine reached a critical mass in 1987, when "Americans began to assume that 'everybody else' had a fax machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Adoption and Use of Fax in Sweden |author=Holmlov, Kramer and Karl-Eric Warneryd|year=1990 |publisher=Elmservier Science |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Brevitate Vitae''''' ({{lang-en|On the Shortness of Life}}) is a moral [[essay]] written by [[Seneca the Younger]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]], sometime around the year 49 AD, to his father-in-law Paulinus. The philosopher brings up many [[Stoicism|Stoic]] principles on the nature of [[time]], namely that people waste much of it in meaningless pursuits.  According to the essay, nature gives people enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. In general, time is best used by living in the present moment in pursuit of the intentional, purposeful life.

Similar ideas can be found in Seneca's treatise ''[[De Otio]]'' (''On Leisure'') and discussion of these themes can often be found in his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'' (letter 49, 101, etc.).

==Date and addressee==
The work is addressed to a man called Paulinus&amp;mdash;probably Pompeius Paulinus, a knight of [[Arelate]]&amp;mdash;and is usually dated to around 49 AD. It is clear from chapters 18 and 19 of ''De Brevitate Vitae'' that Paulinus was ''[[praefectus annonae]]'', the official who superintended the grain supply of Rome, and was, therefore, a man of importance. He was likely a near relative of Seneca's wife, [[Pompeia Paulina]], and quite plausibly her father. He is also thought to be the father of another [[Pompeius Paullinus|Pompeius Paulinus]], who held high public posts under [[Nero]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Nat. Hist.'' xxxiii. 143; [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', xiii. 53. 2; xv. 18. 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lucius Annaeus Seneca:On the Shortness of Life|first=John W.|last=Basore|publisher=William Heinemann Loeb Classical Library|year=1932|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the date of composition, it must have been after the death of [[Caligula]] (41 AD), which Seneca mentions in §18.5. Furthermore, there are two known periods when Paulinus could have served as ''praefectus annonae'', 48–55 and 62–71 AD, and scholars prefer the earlier period. A date of 49 AD has previously been suggested because Seneca writes in §13.8 "that [[Sulla]] was the last of the Romans who extended the ''[[pomerium]]''" (the boundary of [[Rome]]). Since [[Claudius]] extended this in 49/50 AD, it would have been written before this. However [[Miriam Griffin]] has argued that Seneca is quoting a pedant who is asserting that Claudius' extension was illegal, which would mean that Seneca was writing after this date. Griffin has suggested that Seneca wrote ''De Brevitate Vitae'' as an excuse for Paulinus to retire early in 55 AD.&lt;ref name="smithy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Brevitate Vitae|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=161–6|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
In chapter 1 Seneca counters the complaint that life is too short with the view that life is long enough if well-managed. Chapters 2 to 9 survey the many ways in which life is squandered and time frittered away by those people (''occupati'') engrossed in pointless pursuits. Chapters 10 to 17 contrast the philosophical approach to leisure (''[[otium]]'') with the deluded common approach. This culminates in chapters 18 to 20 showing the emancipation of the wise, who can soar above the lives of others mired in endless preoccupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=G. D.|title=Seneca: De Otio, De Brevitate Vitae|year=2003|page=19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521588065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics===
After the introduction (§1), Seneca reviews (§2–3) the distractions which make life seem short, and explains that people are great wasters of time. He then offers (§4–6) three examples of famous Romans ([[Augustus]], [[Cicero]] and [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Livius Drusus]]) who, in various ways, were victims of the engrossed life. He explains (§7–8) that the engrossed do not know how to live or have awareness, and that they waste time because they do not know its value. One should purposefully live for the moment (§9), because tomorrow will be too late. In contrast (§10) the lives of the engrossed seem so short to them because they are constrained to the fleeting present, and recollect the past in pain. They desperately cling on to life (§11) because they haven't lived, unlike the wise, who are always ready to leave life behind. The engrossed include those who live in leisure and luxury (§12), and Seneca explains (§13) that even those who devote themselves to scholarship are wasting their time if their efforts are directed to no end. Accordingly, (§14–15) only those who dedicate their time properly truly live, becoming equal with the great minds of the past, allowing the mind of the sage to even transcend time, like a god. The engrossed, on the other hand, (§16–17) are prey to fidgety and contradictory moods, and their joys and pleasures are bitter with the sense of precariousness. Finally (§18–19) Seneca exhorts Paulinus to abandon public occupations and adopt the contemplative life of the wise, free from the passions. This is contrasted (§20) with the suffering of the engrossed: they die without having ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.|last=Traina|title=La brevità della vita|language=it|publisher=BUR Biblioteca Univ. Rizzoli|year=1993|isbn=8817169404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In the treatise Seneca argues that we waste so much time because we do not properly value it. We expend great effort in protecting other valuables such as money and property, but because time appears intangible, we allow others to occupy it and take time away from us. Wise people, on the other hand, understand that time is the most valuable of all resources, and with effort can free themselves from external control to engage in meaningful introspection and create an intentional life.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

Seneca urges his readers to live in the present, and adapt themselves to a purposeful life in agreement with Nature. Only by doing so, can one then truly unlock both past and future. The completeness of each present moment allows one's awareness to expand to the equal of that of the universe, and achieve true virtue and happiness.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

The statements which urge Paulinus to retire from public life are in notable contrast to Seneca's advice in his ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]'' (to his friend [[Annaeus Serenus]]) to seek public employments in order to render life attractive.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SIoFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=The+stoic+sage+Seneca+de+tranquilitates+animi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VwoKVYG-GcvnUsS5gdAD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20stoic%20sage%20Seneca%20de%20tranquilitates%20animi&amp;f=false Seneca as a Moralist and Philosopher]" in ''The National quarterly review'', p. 18, published 1868 (ed. by [[Edward Isidore Sears|E. I. Sears]]). Retrieved 2017-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his related treatise, ''[[De Otio]]'', Seneca makes the point that there is no inconsistency, and that one can serve the greater community in either or both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Otio|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=150|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{electromagnetism|expanded=Covariance}}

In [[electromagnetism]], the '''electromagnetic tensor''' or '''electromagnetic field tensor''' (sometimes called the '''field strength tensor''', '''Faraday tensor''' or '''Maxwell bivector''') is a mathematical object that describes the [[electromagnetic field]] in spacetime.  The field tensor was first used after the four-dimensional [[tensor]] formulation of [[special relativity]] was introduced by [[Hermann Minkowski]]. The tensor allows related physical laws to be written very concisely.

==Definition==

The electromagnetic tensor, conventionally labelled ''F'', is defined as the [[Exterior derivative#Exterior derivative of a k-form|exterior derivative]] of the [[electromagnetic four-potential]], ''A'', a differential 1-form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K. S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. J. Griffiths| title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |edition=3rd| publisher=Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley| year=2007 | isbn=81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \mathrm{d}A.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, ''F'' is a [[differential form|differential 2-form]]—that is, an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field—on Minkowski space. In component form,

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-gradient]] and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic four-potential|four-potential]].

[[Maxwell's equations#Conventional formulation in SI units|SI units for Maxwell's equations]] and the [[sign convention#Metric signature|particle physicist's sign convention]] for the [[Metric signature|signature]] of [[Minkowski space]] {{nowrap|(+ − − −)}}, will be used throughout this article.

===Relationship with the classical fields===
The [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] can be obtained from the components of the electromagnetic tensor. The relationship is simplest in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E_i = c F_{0i},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the speed of light, and
:&lt;math&gt;B_i = -\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{ijk} F^{jk},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. Note that this gives the fields in a particular reference frame; if the reference frame is changed, the components of the electromagnetic tensor will [[covariant transformation|transform covariantly]], and the fields in the new frame will be given by the new components.

In contravariant [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form,
:&lt;math&gt;
  F^{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
     0     &amp; -E_x/c &amp; -E_y/c &amp; -E_z/c \\
     E_x/c &amp;  0     &amp; -B_z   &amp;  B_y    \\
     E_y/c &amp;  B_z   &amp;  0     &amp; -B_x   \\
     E_z/c &amp; -B_y   &amp;  B_x   &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant form is given by [[Raising and lowering indices#Order-2|index lowering]],

:&lt;math&gt;
  F_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\alpha}F^{\alpha\beta}\eta_{\beta\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
      0     &amp;  E_x/c &amp;  E_y/c &amp;  E_z/c \\
     -E_x/c &amp;  0     &amp; -B_z   &amp;  B_y    \\
     -E_y/c &amp;  B_z   &amp;  0     &amp; -B_x   \\
     -E_z/c &amp; -B_y   &amp;  B_x   &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The Faraday tensor's Hodge dual is 
:&lt;math&gt;
{ G^{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}F_{\gamma\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}
     0     &amp; -B_x &amp; -B_y &amp; -B_z \\
     B_x &amp;  0     &amp; E_z/c   &amp;  -E_y/c    \\
     B_y &amp;  -E_z/c   &amp;  0     &amp; E_x/c   \\
     B_z &amp;  E_y/c   &amp;  -E_x/c   &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix}
}
&lt;/math&gt;

From now on in this article, when the electric or magnetic fields are mentioned, a Cartesian coordinate system is assumed, and the electric and magnetic fields are with respect to the coordinate system's reference frame, as in the equations above.

===Properties===

The matrix form of the field tensor yields the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K. S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list
|1='''[[Skew-symmetric matrix|Antisymmetry]]:'''

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mu\nu} = - F^{\nu\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

|2='''Six independent components:''' In Cartesian coordinates, these are simply the three spatial components of the electric field (''E&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') and magnetic field (''B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'').

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}&lt;/math&gt; is the rank-4 [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. The sign for the above depends on the convention used for the Levi-Civita symbol. The convention used here is &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{0123} = -1 &lt;/math&gt;.

===Significance===

This tensor simplifies and reduces [[Maxwell's equations]] as four vector calculus equations into two tensor field equations. In [[electrostatic]]s and [[electrodynamic]]s, [[Gauss's law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law]] are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0},\quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{ \partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

and reduce to the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha} F^{\alpha\beta} = \mu_0 J^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\alpha} = ( c\rho, \mathbf{J} ) &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[four-current]]. In [[magnetostatic]]s and magnetodynamics, [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Maxwell–Faraday equation]] are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,\quad \frac{ \partial \mathbf{B}}{ \partial t } + \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

which reduce to [[Bianchi identity]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\gamma F_{ \alpha \beta } + \partial_\alpha F_{ \beta \gamma } + \partial_\beta F_{ \gamma \alpha } = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

or using the [[Ricci calculus#Symmetric and antisymmetric parts|index notation with square brackets]]{{ref|antisymmetric|[note 1]}} for the antisymmetric part of the tensor:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_{ [ \alpha } F_{ \beta \gamma ] } = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Relativity==

{{main|Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime}}

The field tensor derives its name from the fact that the electromagnetic field is found to obey the [[tensor transformation law]], this general property of (non-gravitational) physical laws being recognised after the advent of [[special relativity]]. This theory stipulated that all the (non-gravitational) laws of physics should take the same form in all coordinate systems – this led to the introduction of [[tensor]]s. The tensor formalism also leads to a mathematically simpler presentation of physical laws.

The inhomogeneous Maxwell equation leads to the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\alpha J^\alpha = J^\alpha{}_{,\alpha} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

implying [[conservation of charge]].

Maxwell's laws above can be generalised to [[curved spacetime]] by simply replacing [[partial derivative]]s with [[covariant derivative]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{[\alpha\beta;\gamma]} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha\beta}{}_{;\alpha} = \mu_0 J^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where the semi-colon [[Ricci calculus|notation]] represents a covariant derivative, as opposed to a partial derivative. These equations are sometimes referred to as the [[Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime|curved space Maxwell equations]]. Again, the second equation implies charge conservation (in curved spacetime):

:&lt;math&gt;J^\alpha{}_{;\alpha} \, = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Lagrangian formulation of classical electromagnetism==

{{see also|Classical field theory}}

[[Classical electromagnetism]] and [[Maxwell's equations]] can be derived from the [[action (physics)|action]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} = \int \left( -\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} \end{matrix} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - J^\mu A_\mu \right) \mathrm{d}^4 x \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^4 x \;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; is over space and time.

This means the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] density is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L} &amp;= -\frac{1}{4\mu_0} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - J^\mu A_\mu \\
              &amp;= -\frac{1}{4\mu_0} \left( \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \right) \left( \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu \right) - J^\mu A_\mu \\
              &amp;= -\frac{1}{4\mu_0} \left( \partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\nu A^\mu + \partial_\nu A_\mu \partial^\nu A^\mu \right) - J^\mu A_\mu \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The two middle terms in the parentheses are the same, as are the two outer terms, so the Lagrangian density is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = - \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \left( \partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \partial^\mu A^\nu \right) - J^\mu A_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of motion for a field:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial ( \partial_\mu A_\nu )} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_\nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

So the Euler–Lagrange equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; - \partial_\mu \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu \right) + J^\nu = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity in parentheses above is just the field tensor, so this finally simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu} = \mu_0 J^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

That equation is another way of writing the two inhomogeneous [[Maxwell's equations]] (namely,  [[Gauss's law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law]]) using the substitutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \frac{1}{c}E^i &amp;= -F^{0 i} \\
  \epsilon^{ijk} B_k &amp;= -F^{ij}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i, j, k'' take the values 1, 2, and 3.

===Quantum electrodynamics and field theory===

{{main|Quantum electrodynamics|quantum field theory}}

The [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]] extends beyond the classical Lagrangian established in relativity to incorporate the creation and annihilation of photons (and electrons):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \bar\psi \left(i\hbar c \, \gamma^\alpha D_\alpha - mc^2\right) \psi - \frac{1}{4\mu_0} F_{\alpha\beta} F^{\alpha\beta},&lt;/math&gt;

where the first part in the right hand side, containing the [[Dirac spinor]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, represents the [[Dirac field]]. In [[quantum field theory]] it is used as the template for the gauge field strength tensor. By being employed in addition to the local interaction Lagrangian it reprises its usual role in QED.

In economics, '''Epstein–Zin preferences''' refers to a specification of [[recursive]] [[utility]].

A recursive utility function can be constructed from two components: a time aggregator that characterizes preferences in the absence of uncertainty and a risk aggregator that defines the certainty equivalent function that characterizes preferences over static gambles and is used to aggregate the risk associated with future utility.  With Epstein–Zin preferences, the time aggregator is a linearly homogenous [[CES aggregate]] of current consumption and the [[certainty equivalent]] of future utility.  Specifically, the date-t utility index, &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt;, for a sequence of positive scalar consumptions &lt;math&gt;\{c_t, c_{t+1}, c_{t+2}, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;, that are potentially stochastic for time periods beyond date t, is defined recursively as the solution to the nonlinear [[stochastic difference equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
U_t = [ (1-\beta) c_t^\rho + \beta \mu_t(U_{t+1})^\rho ]^{1/\rho} , 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_t( )&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued [[certainty equivalent]] operator.  The parameter &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\beta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; determines the marginal rate of [[time preference]], &lt;math&gt;1/\beta -1&lt;/math&gt;, and the parameter &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; determines the [[elasticity of intertemporal substitution]], &lt;math&gt;1/(1-\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.  Epstein and Zin considered a variety of certainty equivalent operators, but a popular choice for both theoretical and empirical research has been &lt;math&gt;\mu_t(U_{t+1})=[E_t U_{t+1}^\alpha]^{1/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt; denotes the expected value of probability distribution of &lt;math&gt;U_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;, conditional on information available to the planner in date t.  The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; encodes risk aversion, with smaller values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, other things equal, implying a stronger aversion to risk.   The parameter restriction &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\rho&lt;/math&gt; results in a time-additive [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|von Neumann–Morgenstern]] expected utility index.

Importantly, unlike VNM utility functions (e.g. [[isoelastic utility]]), Epstein-Zin preferences allow the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (determined above by &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) to be unrelated to risk aversion (determined above by &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

{{basic forms of government}}
'''Feudalism''' was a combination of legal and military customs in [[medieval Europe]] that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour.
Although  derived from the Latin word ''feodum'' or ''feudum'' (fief),&lt;ref&gt;''feodum'' – see [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfgUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA365 ''The Cyclopedic Dictionary of Law''], by Walter A. Shumaker, George Foster Longsdorf, pg. 365, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; then in use, the term ''feudalism'' and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal [[political system]] by the people living in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noble | first = Thomas | title = The Foundations of Western Civilization | publisher = [[The Teaching Company]] | location = Chantilly, VA | year = 2002 |isbn = 978-1565856370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its classic definition, by [[François-Louis Ganshof]] (1944),&lt;ref name=ganshof&gt;[[François Louis Ganshof]] (1944). ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité''.  Translated into English by [[Philip Grierson]] as ''Feudalism'', with a foreword by [[F. M. Stenton]], 1st ed.: New York and London, 1952; 2nd ed: 1961; 3rd ed.: 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; ''feudalism'' describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s.&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt;

A broader definition of feudalism, as described by [[Marc Bloch]] (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but also those of all three [[estates of the realm]]: the nobility, the [[clergy]], and the [[peasant]]ry bound by [[manorialism]]; this is sometimes referred to as a "feudal society". Since the publication of [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]'s "The Tyranny of a Construct" (1974) and [[Susan Reynolds]]'s ''Fiefs and Vassals'' (1994), there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ebrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=reynolds/&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034347/http://www.wku.edu/~rob.harbison/projects/Gfeudal.html "The Problem of Feudalism: An Historiographical Essay"], by Robert Harbison, 1996, [[Western Kentucky University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles West, ''[[Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c. 800–c. 1100]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

There is no commonly accepted modern definition of feudalism, at least among scholars.&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034150/feudalism "Feudalism"], by [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook1i.html#Feudalism "Feudalism?"], by [[Paul Halsall]]. [[Internet Medieval Sourcebook]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The adjective ''feudal'' was coined in the 17th century, and the noun ''feudalism'', often used in a political and propaganda context, was not coined until the 19th century,&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt; from the French ''féodalité'' (''feudality''), itself an 18th-century creation.

In a classic definition by [[François-Louis Ganshof]] (1944),&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt; ''feudalism'' describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s,&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt; though Ganshof himself noted that his treatment related only to the "narrow, technical, legal sense of the word".

A broader definition, as described in [[Marc Bloch]]'s ''Feudal Society'' (1939),&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt; includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but those of all three [[estates of the realm]]: the nobility, the [[clergy]], and those living by their labour, most directly the [[peasant]]ry bound by [[manorialism]]; this order is often referred to as "feudal society", echoing Bloch's usage.

Since the publication of [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]'s "The Tyranny of a Construct" (1974)&lt;ref name=ebrown/&gt; and [[Susan Reynolds]]'s ''Fiefs and Vassals'' (1994),&lt;ref name=reynolds/&gt; there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Outside a European context, the concept of feudalism is often used only by [[analogy]] (called ''semi-feudal''), most often in discussions of [[feudal Japan]] under the ''[[shōgun]]s'', and sometimes medieval and [[Gondar]]ine [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=hmco/&gt;  However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing feudalism (or traces of it) in places as diverse as [[Spring and Autumn period]] in [[China]], [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], the [[Indian feudalism|Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] and [[Jim Crow|Jim Crow American South]].&lt;ref name=hmco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/mil/html/mh_017900_feudalism.htm |title=Reader's Companion to Military History |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041112062036/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/mil/html/mh_017900_feudalism.htm |archivedate = 2004-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''feudalism'' has also been applied—often inappropriately or pejoratively—to non-Western societies where institutions and attitudes similar to those of [[medieval]] Europe are perceived to prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for example: {{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians and political theorists believe that the term ''feudalism'' has been deprived of specific meaning by the many ways it has been used, leading them to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ebrown/&gt;

[[File:Codex Manesse Reinmar von Zweter.jpg|thumb|Herr [[Reinmar von Zweter]], a 13th-century [[Minnesang|Minnesinger]], was depicted with his noble arms in [[Codex Manesse]].]]
The term "féodal" was used in 17th-century French legal treatises (1614)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/feudal |title=Feudal (n.d.) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=September 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Civilization of the Middle Ages |publisher= |last=Cantor |first=Norman F. |author-link=Norman F. Cantor |year=1994 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into English legal treatises as an adjective, such as "feodal government".

In the 18th century, [[Adam Smith]], seeking to describe economic systems, effectively coined the forms "feudal government" and "feudal system" in his book ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776).&lt;ref name=cheyette/&gt; In the 19th century the adjective "feudal" evolved into a noun: "feudalism".&lt;ref name=cheyette&gt;Fredric L. Cheyette. "FEUDALISM, EUROPEAN." in ''New Dictionary of the History Of Ideas'', Vol. 2, ed. Maryanne Cline Horowitz, Thomas Gale 2005, {{ISBN|0-684-31379-0}}. pp. 828–831&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''feudalism'' is recent, first appearing in French in 1823, Italian in 1827, English in 1839, and in German in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=cheyette /&gt;

The term "feudal" or "feodal" is derived from the [[medieval Latin]] word ''feodum''. The etymology of ''feodum'' is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an [[Arabic]] origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a ''beneficium'' (Latin).&lt;ref name=lubetski&gt;Meir Lubetski (ed.). ''Boundaries of the ancient Near Eastern world: a tribute to Cyrus H. Gordon''. "Notices on Pe'ah, Fay' and Feudum" by Alauddin Samarrai. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dO4rbfA_WVIC&amp;pg=PA248 Pg. 248–250], Continuum International Publishing Group, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the term ''feudum'', or ''feodum'', began to replace ''beneficium'' in the documents.&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt; The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier.&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt; The origin of the ''feudum'' and why it replaced ''beneficium'' has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;

The most widely held theory was proposed by [[Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern]] in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;"fee, n.2." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Kern, '[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_taa005187001_01/_taa005187001_01_0032.php Feodum]', ''De taal- en letterbode'', 1( 1870), pp. 189-201.&lt;/ref&gt; being supported by, amongst others, [[William Stubbs]]&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stubbs]]. ''The Constitutional History of England'' (3 volumes), 2nd edition 1875–78, Vol. 1, pg. 251, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marc Bloch]].&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety1&gt;Marc Bloch. ''Feudal Society'', Vol. 1, 1964. pp.165–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety2&gt;Marc Bloch. ''Feudalism'', 1961, pg. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term ''*fehu-ôd'', in which ''*fehu'' means "cattle" and ''-ôd'' means "goods", implying "a moveable object of value."&lt;ref name=bloch-ety1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety2/&gt; Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as ''feos'', a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word ''feos'' meaning movable property changed little by little to ''feus'' meaning the exact opposite: landed property.&lt;ref name=bloch-ety1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety2/&gt;

Another theory was put forward by [[Archibald R. Lewis]].&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt; Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not ''feudum'' (or ''feodum''), but rather ''foderum'', the earliest attested use being in [[Astronomus]]'s ''[[Vita Hludovici]]'' (840).&lt;ref name=arlewis&gt;[[Archibald R. Lewis]]. ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718–1050'', 1965, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; In that text is a passage about [[Louis the Pious]] that says ''annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant'', which can be translated as "Louis forbade that military [[provender]] (which they popularly call "fodder") be furnished.."&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;

Another theory by [[Alauddin Samarrai]] suggests an Arabic origin, from ''fuyū'' (the plural of ''fay'', which literally means "the returned", and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight').&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;&lt;ref name=samarrai&gt;[[Alauddin Samarrai]]. "The term 'fief': A possible Arabic origin", ''Studies in Medieval Culture'', 4.1 (1973), pp. 78–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include ''feo'', ''feu'', ''feuz'', ''feuum'' and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a [[loanword]]. The first use of these terms is in [[Languedoc]], one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Muslim Spain. Further, the earliest use of ''feuum'' (as a replacement for ''beneficium'') can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at [[Fraxinetum]] ([[La Garde-Freinet]]) in [[Provence]] was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the Arabic word ''fuyū'' (the plural of ''fay''), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms – ''feo, feu, feuz, feuum'' and others – from which eventually ''feudum'' derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically "fanciful roots" in order to claim the most outlandish things to be of Arabian or Muslim origin.&lt;ref name=samarrai/&gt;

==History==
{{English Feudalism}}

Feudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the [[decentralization]] of an empire: especially in the [[Carolingian]] empires, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure{{clarify|date=September 2012}} necessary to support cavalry without the ability to allocate land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.&lt;ref name="Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332"&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. pp. 332–343&lt;/ref&gt;

These acquired powers significantly [[federation|diminished unitary power]] in these empires. Only when the infrastructure existed to maintain unitary power—as with the European monarchies—did feudalism begin to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappear.&lt;ref name="Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332"/&gt;

===Classic feudalism===
:''See also [[Feudalism in England]], [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Examples of feudalism]]''
The classic [[François-Louis Ganshof]] version of feudalism&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt; describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of  service to the lord. There were many varieties of [[feudal land tenure]], consisting of  military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt;

===Vassalage===
[[File:Hommage du comté de Clermont-en-Beauvaisis.png|thumbnail|[[Homage (feudal)|Homage]] of [[Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]]]]
Before a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a [[commendation ceremony]],  which was composed of the two-part act of [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and oath of [[fealty]]. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. ''Fealty'' comes from the Latin ''fidelitas'' and denotes the [[fidelity]] owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. "Fealty" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage.&lt;ref name=stephenson&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism ''Medieval Feudalism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209083705/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism |date=2012-02-09 }}, by [[Carl Stephenson (historian)|Carl Stephenson]]. Cornell University Press, 1942. Classic introduction to Feudalism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to "aid", or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer calls to military service on behalf of the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed [[court baron]], or at the king's court.&lt;ref&gt;Encyc. Brit. op.cit. It was a standard part of the feudal contract (fief [land], fealty [oath of allegiance], faith [belief in God]) that every tenant was under an obligation to attend his overlord's court to advise and support him; [[Sir Harris Nicolas]], in ''Historic Peerage of England'', ed. [[William Courthope (officer of arms)|Courthope]], p.18, quoted by Encyc. Brit, op.cit., p. 388: "It was the principle of the feudal system that every tenant should attend the court of his immediate superior"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|France in the late 15th century: a mosaic of feudal territories]]
It could also involve the vassal providing "counsel", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the [[manor]] this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see [[examples of feudalism]].

===The "Feudal Revolution" in France===
In its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of "politics of land" (an expression used by the historian [[Marc Bloch]]).  The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a "feudal revolution" or "mutation" and a "fragmentation of powers" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later:&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 522-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as [[castellan]]s and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord's mill, etc.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt; (what [[Georges Duby]] called collectively the "''seigneurie banale''"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;).  Power in this period became more personal.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p.522.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "fragmentation of powers" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, p.523.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords.  In response to this, the idea of a "[[liege lord]]" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Hallam. ''Capetian France 987–1328'', p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of European feudalism (1500–1850s)===
{{Further|Abolition of feudalism in France}}

Feudalism effectively ended by about 1500.&lt;ref&gt;"The End of Feudalism" in J.H.M. Salmon, ''Society in Crisis: France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979) pp 19–26&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility's claim on power, but also because the [[Black Death]] reduced the nobility's hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the Feudal system hung on in France until the French Revolution, and the system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. Russia finally abolished [[serfdom]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon'' (1996) pp 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Topolski, Continuity and discontinuity in the development of the feudal system in Eastern Europe (Xth to XVIIth centuries)" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1981) 10#2 pp: 373–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] explains how at an early stage of the [[French Revolution]], on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, "The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely." Lefebvre explains:

{{quote|Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude — which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office, conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices.... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&amp;pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P,|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Originally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, "The survival of the nobility during the French Revolution." ''Past and Present'' (1967): 71–86 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650023 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Hanson, ''The A to Z of the French Revolution'' (2013) pp 293–94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudal society==
{{main|Manorialism}}
[[File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[socage]] on the royal [[demesne]] in  feudal England, c. 1310]]
The phrase "feudal society" as defined by [[Marc Bloch]]&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;Bloch, Marc, ''Feudal Society.'' Tr. L.A. Manyon. Two volume. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961 {{ISBN|0-226-05979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the [[peasant]]ry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the "powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classical feudal hierarchy.

==Historiography==
The idea of ''feudalism'' was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.

===Evolution of the concept===
The concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] ''De L'Esprit des Lois'' (1748; published in English as ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''), and [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]]’s ''Histoire des anciens Parlements de France'' (1737; published in English as ''An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom'', 1739).&lt;ref name=cheyette/&gt; In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', or French monarchy. This was [[the Age of Enlightenment]] when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the "Dark Ages" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Robert Bartlett]]. "Perspectives on the Medieval World" in ''Medieval Panorama'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them "feudalism" meant [[Fiefdom|seigneurial]] privileges and prerogatives. When the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|French Constituent Assembly]] abolished the "feudal regime" in August 1789 this is what was meant.

[[Adam Smith]] used the term "feudal system" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by [[serf]]s to landowning nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/Feudal.htm |title=Feudalism |author=Richard Abels |date= |work= |publisher=usna.edu |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] also used the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal [[mode of production]]) as the order coming before [[capitalism]]. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the [[aristocracy]]) in their control of arable land, leading to a [[class society]] based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under [[serfdom]] and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; Marx thus defined feudalism primarily by its economic characteristics.

He also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: ‘in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny — under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs’.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, ''Marx: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) [first published 1980], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. [[Eric Wolf]]) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.

===Later studies===

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[John Horace Round]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions as to the character of English society before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (Holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).

In the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian [[Marc Bloch]], arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian.,&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in ''Feudal Society'' (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection – both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centered on "lordship", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt;

In contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian [[François-Louis Ganshof]] defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité?'' ("What is feudalism?", 1944; translated in English as ''Feudalism''). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars,&lt;ref name=daileader&gt;[[Philip Daileader]], "Feudalism", ''The High Middle Ages'', Course No. 869, [[The Teaching Company]], {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.

Although he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] that came to be known as the [[Annales School]], [[Georges Duby]] was an exponent of the ''Annaliste'' tradition. In  a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled ''La société aux XIe et XIIe siècles dans la région mâconnaise'' (''Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the [[Mâconnais]] region''), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian [[Cluny Abbey|monastery of Cluny]], as well as the dioceses of [[Ancient Diocese of Mâcon|Mâcon]] and [[Dijon]], Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the [[Mâconnais]] region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions—particularly comital courts established under the [[Carolingian]] monarchy—that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.

===Challenges to the feudal model===
In 1974, U.S. historian [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]&lt;ref name=ebrown&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the label ''feudalism'' as an anachronism that imparts a false sense of uniformity to the concept. Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of ''feudalism'', she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back "tyrannically" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; In ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted'' (1994),&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;Reynolds, Susan, ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-19-820648-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Reynolds]] expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; Reynolds argues:
:Too many models of feudalism used for comparisons, even by Marxists, are still either constructed on the 16th-century basis or incorporate what, in a Marxist view, must surely be superficial or irrelevant features from it.  Even when one restricts oneself to Europe and to feudalism in its narrow sense it is extremely doubtful whether feudo-vassalic institutions formed a coherent bundle of institutions or concepts that were structurally separate from other  institutions  and concepts of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''feudal'' has also been applied to non-Western societies in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (See [[Examples of feudalism]]). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;John Whitney Hall, "Feudalism in Japan—a reassessment," ''Comparative studies in Society and History'' (1962) 5#1 pp: 15–51 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/177767 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Friday,  "The Futile Paradigm: In Quest of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan," ''History Compass'' 8.2 (2010): 179–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term ''feudalism'' has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and [[political theorist]]s to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt;

Richard Abels notes that "Western Civilization and World Civilization textbooks now shy away from the term 'feudalism'."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abels, "The Historiography of a Construct: 'Feudalism' and the Medieval Historian." ''History Compass'' (2009) 7#3 pp: 1008–1031.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graeme Donald Snooks''' (born 1944 in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]) is a systems theorist and stratologist who has developed a general dynamic theory to explain complex [[living systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/]&lt;/ref&gt; His resulting "dynamic-strategy theory" has been employed to analyse the fluctuating fortunes of life over the past 4,000 million years (myrs) and of human society over the past 2 myrs; to analyse contemporary economic problems (inflation,&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; financial crises,&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; climate change&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;); to explore socio-political issues (population expansion, the emergence of democracy, the "clash of civilizations"); to analyse the emergence, operation, and malfunction of the mind; and to make scientific predictions about the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New discoveries emerging from Snooks' publications include: '''existential schizophrenia''', '''strategic frustration''', '''strategic selection''', the '''growth-inflation curve''', the '''strategy function''', the '''logological constant''' (akin to the cosmological constant), the '''Snooks–Panov Vertical''', '''technological paradigm shifts''', the '''Solar Revolution''', and, most importantly, the '''strategic ''logos'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''. His body of work challenges the existing paradigms of orthodox (neo-classical) [[economics]], climate-mitigation economics, [[Marxism]], neo-[[Darwinism]], [[evolutionary psychology]], self-organisation theory, and all other supply-side systems.''

For twenty-one years, from 1989 to 2010, Graeme Snooks was the foundation Coghlan Research Professor of Economics in the [[Institute of Advanced Studies]] at the [[Australian National University]]. Currently he is the Executive Director of both the '''Institute of Global Dynamic Systems''' and '''IGDS Books'''&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/GDSCpapers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in Canberra. He was educated at [[Mount Lawley Senior High School]] (1957–1961), the [[University of Western Australia]] (BEc,1966; MEc, 1968), and the [[Australian National University]] (PhD, 1972). Professor Snooks has been elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences (1991), Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (UK) (1990), and Fellow of the Russian Academy of Humanities (2006).

==Books and articles==
[[File: Graeme Donald Snooks, Canberra, May 2013.jpg|thumb|'''Graeme Donald Snooks''', May 2013]]
Professor Snooks has published 30 books, including: ''Depression and Recovery'' (1974), ''Domesday Economy'' (with J. McDonald) (1986), ''Economics Without Time'' (1993), ''Historical Analysis in Economics'' (1993), ''Portrait of the Family within the Total Economy'' (1994), ''Was the Industrial Revolution Necessary?'', (1994), ''The Dynamic Society'' (1996), ''The Ephemeral Civilization'' (1997), ''The Laws of History'' (1998), ''Longrun Dynamics'' (1998), ''Global Transition'' (1999), ''The Global Crisis Makers'' (2000), ''The Collapse of Darwinism'' (2003), ''The Selfcreating Mind'' (2006), ''The Coming Eclipse, or The Triumph of Climate Mitigation Over Solar Revolution'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/home/books/the-coming-eclipse]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead God Rising. Religion and Science in the Universal Life-System'' (2010).,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/home/books/dead-god-rising-1]&lt;/ref&gt; , ''The Death of Zarathustra. Notes on Truth for the Risk-Taker'' (2011), ''Ark of the Sun: the improbable voyage of life'' (November 2015), ''Ultimate Reality &amp; its Dissidents'' (March 2016), and ''Time's Gateway: a personal quest for ultimate reality'' (August 2017). 

Graeme Snooks' recent book, '''Ark of the Sun''' provides an overview of his thinking over five decades on the dynamics of life and human society and reveals the underlying reality of life - the strategic '''''logos''''' - which is the ultimate complex living system. '''Ultimate Reality &amp; its Dissidents''' provides a unique philosophy of life based on his realist general dynamic theory. And '''Time's Gateway''' shows how these ideas emerged over the past fifty years. He is currently exploring two major issues. First, the existential dangers of metaphysical systems of thought to the survival of humanity, together with the corrective contribution of realist thinking. And second, the contribution of DNA testing to the exploration of societal dynamics over the past 60,000 years. 

Articles on the theory of complex living systems have been published by Snooks in ''Advances in Space Research'' (2005), ''Complexity'' (the journal of the [[Santa Fe Institute]]) (2008), and [[Social Evolution &amp; History]] (2002, 2005, 2007). In a recent (11 November 2016) article - '''The Triumph of Trump and the failure of the intellectuals''' - he applies the dynamic-strategy theory to the recent US Presidential election (see Graeme Snooks, Researchgate) and provides suggestions for the type of dynamic strategy that the USA would need to pursue in order to "make America great again" and to position itself at the forefront of the forthcoming technological paradigm shift.

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

==Variants==

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

'''House numbering''' is the system of giving a unique [[number]] to each [[building]] in a [[street]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]], with the intention of making it easier to locate a particular building. The house number is often part of a [[Address (geography)|postal address]]. The term describes the number of any building (residential or not) with a mailbox, or even a [[land lot|vacant lot]].

House numbering schemes vary by location, and in many cases even within cities. In some areas of the world, including many remote areas, houses are named but are not assigned numbers.

== History ==
[[File:Goodman's Field.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the earliest street numbering systems was introduced along Prescott Street in Goodman's Field, London. [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]].]]
A house numbering scheme was present in [[Pont Notre-Dame]] in [[Paris]] in 1512.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/07/16/102074964.pdf |title=The Numbering of Houses |date=16 July 1898 |work=The New York Times|access-date = 27 September 2015 |publisher=Adolph Ochs}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the purpose of the numbering was generally to determine the distribution of property ownership in the city, rather than for the purpose of organization.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

In the 18th century the first street numbering schemes were applied across Europe, to aid in administrative tasks and the provision of services such as [[Mail|mail delivery]]. The ''New View of [[London]]'' reported in 1708 that "at Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, instead of signs, the houses are distinguished by numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyZfYaLXsuUC |title=London: A Social History |author=Roy Porter |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=126|isbn=978-0-674-53839-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Paris [[suburb]]s were numbered in the 1720s; the houses in the Jewish quarter in the city of [[Prague]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] were numbered in the same decade to aid the authorities in the [[conscription]] of the [[History of the Jews in Prague|Jews]].{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

Street numbering took off in the mid 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]], where authorities were ordered to "fix numbers on the houses ... in little villages on the day before the troops march in". In the 1750s and 60s, street numbering on a large scale was applied in [[Madrid]], London, Paris, and [[Vienna]], as well as many other cities across [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://histoiremesure.revues.org/3942?lang=en |title=Addressing the Houses: The Introduction of House Numbering in Europe |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1768, [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV of France]] decreed that all French houses outside of Paris affix house numbers, primarily for tracking troops quartered in civilian homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Indexing the great ledger of the community: urban house numbering, city directories, and the production of spatial legibility |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305748807000709 |journal=Journal of Historical Geography |date=1 April 2008 |pages=286–310 |volume=34 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2007.06.003 |first=Reuben S. |last=Rose-Redwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Critical Toponymies: The Contested Politics of Place Naming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-7453-5 |first=Reuben |last=Rose-Redwood |year=2009|editor-last = Berg|editor-first = Lawrence D.|editor-last2 = Vuolteenaho|editor-first2 = Jani |chapter=Indexing the Great Ledger of the Community: Urban House Numbering, City Directories, and the Production of Spatial Legibility |page=199|access-date = 26 September 2015|orig-year = originally published in 2008 in ''Journal of Historical Geography'' but revised in 2009|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 5 means that the property is between {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m}} from the datum point of the road, and is on the left hand side of the road as viewed from the datum point.]]
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the current standard (Australia/New Zealand joint standard AS/NZS 4819:2011 - Rural &amp; Urban Addressing)&lt;ref&gt;https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=1497944&lt;/ref&gt; is directed at local governments that have the primary responsibility for addressing and road naming. The standard calls for lots and buildings on newly created streets to be assigned odd numbers (on the left) and even numbers (on the right) when facing in the direction of increasing numbers (the European system) reflecting already common practice. It first came into force in 2003 under AS/NZS 4819:2003 - Geographic Information – Rural &amp; Urban Addressing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icsm.gov.au/street/&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are where the road forms part of the boundary between different council areas or cities. For example, Underwood Road in [[Rochedale South]], divided between [[Logan City]] and the [[City of Brisbane]].

In [[New South Wales]], the vast majority of streets were numbered before 2003, some with odd numbers assigned to houses on the right of the street when facing the direction along which numbers increase. There is no plan to reassign these numbers.

On some long urban roads (e.g. [[Parramatta Road]] in Sydney) numbers ascend until the road crosses a council or suburb boundary, then start again at 1 or 2, where a street sign gives the name of the relevant area &amp;mdash; these streets have repeating numbers. In semi-rural and rural areas, where houses and farms are widely spaced, a numbering system based on tens of metres or (less commonly) metres has been devised. Thus a farm {{convert|2300|m}} from the start of the road, on the right-hand side would be numbered 230.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/street/index.html "Street Addressing Working Group and the National Street Addressing Standard"]. ''Intergovernmental Committee on Survey and Mapping''. March 19, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ballarat]] Central, Victoria uses the US system of increasing house numbers by 100 after a major cross street. Streets are designated North or South depending upon their relative position to Sturt Street.

[[File:House number of TRA Jingmei Station 20061203.jpg|180x180px|An example of the house numbering in rural area of [[Taiwan]].|thumb]]
In Japan and South Korea, a city is divided into small numbered zones. The houses within each zone are then labelled in the order in which they were constructed, or clockwise around the block. This system is comparable to the system of [[sestiere|sestieri]] (''sixths'') used in [[Venice]]. Visitors to a large, complex city like [[Tokyo]] often must resort to asking for directions at a [[Kōban|local police substation]].

In [[Hong Kong]], a former [[British colony]], the British and European norm to number houses on one side of the street with odd numbers, and the other side with even numbers, is generally followed. Some roads or streets along the coastline may however have numbering only on one side, even if the opposite side is later [[land reclamation|reclaimed]]. These roads or streets include [[Ferry Street, Hong Kong|Ferry Street]], [[Connaught Road West]], and [[Gloucester Road, Hong Kong|Gloucester Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hk-place.com/db.php?post=d006043]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[PRC|mainland Chinese]] cities use the European system, with odd numbers on one side of the road and even numbers on the opposite side. In high-density old Shanghai, a street number may be either a ''hao'' ("号" hào) or ''nong'' ("弄" nòng/lòng), both of them being numbered successively. A ''hao'' refers a door rather than a building, for example, if a building with the address 25 Wuming Rd is followed by another building, which has three entrances opening to the street, the latter will be numbered as three different ''hao'', from 27 to 29 Wuming Rd.

A ''nong'', sometimes translated as "lane", refers to a block of buildings. So if in the above example the last building is followed by an enclosed compound, it will have the address "lane 31, Wuming Rd". A ''nong'' is further subdivided in its own ''hao'', which do not correlate with the ''hao'' of the street, so the full address of an apartment within a compound may look like "Apartment 5005, no. 7, lane 31, Wuming Rd".

== Southeast Asia ==
The most common street address formats in [[Vietnam]] are:

* A number followed by the street name, for example "{{lang|vi|123 đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}". This is the most basic, most common format.
* A number with an alphabetic suffix: "{{lang|vi|123A đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", "{{lang|vi|123B đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", etc. This format occurs when a property is numbered 123 but later subdivided into two houses with different addresses.
* If the house lies on an alley, the alley number is combined with the house number: for example, in "{{lang|vi|123/3 đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", 123 is the alley's address, and 3 is the house number on that alley.
* More complex house numbers may occur on alleys that branch from other alleys or properties on alleys are subdivided, for example "{{lang|vi|123/3E đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}" or "{{lang|vi|123/3/5B đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}". An extreme example would be "{{lang|vi|7/14/12/3/23a đường 182|italic=no}}", which is located on 3rd alley off 12th alley off 14th alley off 7th alley off 182nd street.

Another scheme is based on residential areas called {{lang|vi|cư xá}}. A {{lang|vi|cư xá}} is addressed by house number, road, and {{lang|vi|cư xá}}, for example "{{lang|vi|123 đường số 4 cư xá Bình Thới|italic=no}}". Some localities still use an older address format based on neighborhood ({{lang|vi|khu}}): for example, in "{{lang|vi|7A/34 Tô Hiến Thành|italic=no}}", 7A is the neighborhood number. This confusing format is being gradually phased out in favor of the more modern formats above.

== West Asia ==

Generally in [[Iran]] and especially in the capital [[Tehran]] odd numbers are all on one side and the even numbers opposite along streets. Infrequently, this style confuses people because this is not how it works everywhere in the city and sometimes the numbers get intertwined with each other. In the rural parts, some houses have no number at all and some have their owner's details as the number instead. In some cases, using the number 13 is skipped replacing it with equivalents such as: 12+1 or 14-1
[[File:Digital House Numbering.jpg|thumb|New digital house numbering in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]]]

== Northern and Western Europe ==
[[File:House numbers odd and even.svg|thumb|European scheme]]
In Europe the most common house numbering scheme, in this article referred to as the "European" scheme, is to number each plot on one side of the road with ascending [[odd number]]s, from 1, and those on the other with ascending [[even number]]s, from 2 (or sometimes 0). The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase.

Where additional buildings are inserted or subdivided, these are often suffixed a, b, c, etc. (in Spain and France,  ''[[wikt:bis#Latin|bis]]'', ''[[wikt:ter#Latin|ter]]'', ''quater'').  Where buildings are later combined, they may use just one of the original numbers, combine them ("13/15"), or give their address as a range (e.g. "13–17"; not to be construed as including the even numbers 14 and 16). Buildings with multiple entrances may have a single number for the entire building or a separate number for each entrance.

Where plots are not built upon gaps may be left in the numbering scheme or marked on maps for the plots. If buildings are added to a stretch of old street the following may be used rather than a long series of suffixes to the existing numbers: a new name for a new estate/block along the street (e.g. ''1-100 Waterloo Place/Platz, Sud St.''.); a new road name inserted along the course of a street either with or without mention of the parent street; unused numbers ''above'' the highest house number may be used (although rarely as this introduces confusing discontinuity), or the upper remainder of the street is renumbered.

Other local numbering schemes are also in use for administrative or historic reasons, including clockwise and anti-clockwise numbering, district-based numbering, distance-based numbering, and double numbering.

=== Finland ===
The Finnish numbering system incorporates solutions to the problems which arose with mass [[urbanization]] and increase in building density.  Addresses always are formatted as street name followed by street address number.  With new, [[infill]] building, new addresses are created by adding letters representing the new ground level access point within the old street address, and if there are more apartments than ground level access points, a number added for the apartment number within the new development. The original street numbering system followed the pattern of odd numbers on one side and even numbers on the other side of the street, with lower numbers towards the center of town and higher numbers further away from the center.

The infill numbering system avoids renumbering the entire street when developments are modified. For example, Mannerheimintie 5 (a large mansion house on a large city plot) was demolished and replaced with 4 new buildings each with 2 stairwells all accessible from Mannerheimintie. The 8 new access stairwells are labelled A B C D E F G and H (each with the letter visible above the stairwell). Each stairwell has 4 apartments on 5 floors, so the new development has 160 new addresses in all running from Mannerheimintie 5 A 1 through to Mannerheimintie 5 H 160.  The opposite example is where old, narrow buildings have been combined; Iso Roobertinkatu 36, 38 and 40 were demolished in the 1920s and the new building has the address Iso Roobertinkatu 36-40.

In the rural parts of Finland, a variant of this method is used. As in towns, odd and even numbers are on opposite sides of the road, but many numbers are skipped. Instead, the house number indicates the distance in tens of metres from the start of the road. For example, "Pengertie 159" would be 1590 metres from the place where Pengertie starts.

=== Netherlands ===
When more buildings are constructed than numbers were originally allotted, discontinuity of numbering is avoided by giving multiple adjacent buildings the same number, with a letter suffix starting at "A". In [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]], red numbers are used for upstairs apartments.

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]], the European scheme is most commonly used. However, in [[Porto]] and several other cities in the Portuguese [[Northern Portugal|Northern region]], as well as in the [[Cascais]] Municipality (near [[Lisbon]]), houses are numbered in the North American style, with the number assigned being proportional to the distance in [[meter]]s from the baseline of the street.

[[Lisbon]] numbering is European and furthermore 'from the river, odd numbers left'. Because the [[Tagus]] borders Lisbon on the south and the east, this means that north-south streets are numbered low from the south, and east-west streets are numbered low from the east.

In many new planned neighborhoods of Portugal houses and other buildings are identified by a ''lote'' (plot) number without reference to their street. This is in law the ''número de polícia'', which literally means ''police's number'' &amp;mdash; the police formerly assigned the numbers rather than the town hall. The ''lote'' is the construction plot number used in the [[urban plan]], a consecutive number series applies to a broad neighborhood. In theory and in most cases, the use of a ''lote'' number system is provisional, being replaced by a traditional street number system some time after the neighborhood is built and inhabited. In some neighborhoods, ''lote'' numbers are kept for many years, some never being replaced by street numbers.

The relatively new planned neighborhood of [[Parque das Nações]] in Lisbon has also a different numbering scheme: each building is referred by its plot, parcel, and building (in Portuguese: ''lote'', ''parcela'', ''prédio''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publico.pt/2012/11/22/local/noticia/caiu-o-muro-que-dividia-o-parque-das-nacoes-1573465&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:House numbers clockwise.jpg|thumb|Clockwise scheme. A similar, counter-clockwise scheme also remains in use in parts of Germany.]]
The European system is most widely used.  The odd numbers will typically be on the left-hand side as seen from the centre of the town or village, with the lowest numbers at the end of the street closest to the town centre. Intermediate properties usually have a number suffixed A, B, C, etc., much more rarely instead being given a half number, e.g. the old police station at {{frac|20|1|2}} Camberwell Church Street. It is extremely rare for a property (built next to no. 2 after the street had been numbered) to be zero (0) or named Minusone; researchers have found these instances once in [[Middlesbrough]] and once in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/&lt;/ref&gt;  In many rural streets, significantly built alongside before 1900, houses remain named (unnumbered).

In some places, particularly when open land, a river or a large church fronts one side, all plots on one side of a street are numbered consecutively. Such a street if modern and long is more likely to be numbered using odd numbers, starting at 1.  Along oldest streets, numbering is usually clockwise and consecutive: for example in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], some [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]], and in many villages in [[Wales]]. This usually also applies to all [[cul de sac|culs-de-sac]]s. For instance, [[10 Downing Street]], the official home of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is next door to [[11 Downing Street]].  Houses which surround squares are usually numbered consecutively clockwise.

In the early/mid 19th century numbering of long urban streets commonly changed (from clockwise, strict consecutive to odds (consecutive) which face evens (consecutive)). Where this took place it presents a street-long pitfall to researchers using historic [[Kelly's directory|street directories]] and other records. A very rare variation may be seen where a [[high street]] (main street) continues from a less commercial part &amp;mdash; a road which breaks the UK conventions by not starting at 1 or 2. On one side of the main road between Stratford and Leytonstone houses up to no. 122 are "Leytonstone Road". The next house is "124 High Road, Leytonstone".

Developers may avoid the number 13 for house numbering as in [[Iran]], because that number is [[Triskaidekaphobia|considered by some to be unlucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7779212.stm "Would you buy a number 13 house?"]. BBC News. December 12, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocks of flats (apartments) are treated in two ways:
*Flats numbered individually as part of the street. A lintel will typically be embossed or metalled "1-24 Acacia Avenue" or "Flats 1-24 Acacia Avenue".
*Flats numbered by building. The building retains its own number on the street e.g. "Flat 24, 1 Acacia Avenue" or increasingly as commonly: "Apartment 1-X, 1 Acacia Avenue" or by floor: "Apartment 9D, 1 Acacia Avenue". Outside the number of flats is discreetly shown or not revealed.

In the UK street numbering and street signposts vary across local authorities.  Numbering plates (or similar) are overwhelmingly at the discretion of house owners.

===Marking of numbers===
In the UK [[fanlight]]s in front doors were introduced in the 1720s in which the house number may be engraved.&lt;ref&gt;The Fanlight Number Company, July 19, 2009. http://www.fanlightnumbers.co.uk/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary architecture and modern house building techniques see alternatively acrylic, aluminium, or glass, ceramic, brass, slate, or stone used.

==Southern Europe==
=== Italy ===
Italy mostly follows the European scheme described above but there are some exceptions, generally for historical reasons.

In [[Venice]], houses are numbered within six named series (one per ''[[sestiere (Venice)|sestiere]]'' district). Similarly, small villages in rural areas may also occasionally use a single progressive series for all house numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Example of house numbers in Sistiana, Italy [http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/trieste/cronaca/2014/01/20/news/portopiccolo-ha-gia-il-suo-indirizzo-sistiana-231-per-le-case-negozi-al-232-1.8508788 "Portopiccolo ha già il suo indirizzo: Sistiana 231 per le case, negozi al 232"]. ''Il Piccolo''. January 20, 2014. Retrieved September 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Genoa]], [[Savona]] and [[Florence]] houses are marked with black (sometimes blue in Florence) numbers; businesses are usually (but not always) given red numbers, giving up to two distinct, numerically overlapping series per street. Those of businesses are denoted in all other writing (documents, online directories, etc.) by the addition of the letter "r" (e.g. "Via dei Servi 21r").

=== Turkey ===
In most of Turkey, currently the European house numbering scheme is applied. The [[Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality]] introduced new house numbering and street signs in 2007 by two official designers.&lt;ref name="Hürriyet"&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumartesi/6718942.asp], Istanbul's red signs. (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central and Eastern Europe ==
In [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], with some exceptions, houses are typically numbered in the European style. Many streets, however, use the "[[boustrophedon]]" system.{{explain|date=March 2017}}

=== Austria ===
A double numbering system has been used, similar to the system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which also were formerly parts of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
[[File:House numbers Prague map.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|Map of house numbering in the Prague district of Vyšehrad]]
In some [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] cities and settlements, two numbering systems are used concurrently.

The basic house number is the "old" or "conscription number" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''popisné číslo'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''súpisné číslo''). The conscription number is unique within the municipal part (a village, a quarter, mostly for one cadastral area) or within a whole small municipality.

For makeshift and recreational buildings in the Czech Republic, "registration number" (''evidenční číslo'') from a separate number series is used instead of the descriptive number. Typically, this number begins with zero or with the letter "E", or has different colour, or contains words like ''nouzová stavba'' ("makeshift structure") or ''chata'' ("weekend house"), etc.

In some settlements where streets have names (mostly in cities), "new" or "orientational numbers" (Czech: ''orientační číslo'', Slovak: ''orientačné číslo'') are also used concurrently. The orientational numbers are arranged sequentially within the street or square. If the building is on a corner or has two sides, it can have two or more orientation numbers, one for each of the adjacent streets or squares. Solitary houses distant from named streets often have no orientation number. In some places, the name of a small quarter is used instead of a street name. If there is a new building between two older numbered ones, the orientation number is distinguished with an additional lower case letter (for example, the sequence could be 5, 7, 9, 9a, 9b, 9c, 11, 13).  In the 1930–1950s in [[Brno]], lower case letters were used for separate entrances of modern block houses perpendicular to the street.

Either number may be used in addresses. Sometimes, businesses will use both numbers to avoid confusion, usually putting the descriptive (or registration) number first: "Hlavní 20/7". The two (or three) types of numbers are commonly distinguished by colour of the sign. Each municipality can have its own traditional or official rules and colours. In [[Prague]] and many other [[Bohemia]]n cities, descriptive numbers are red, orientation numbers are blue and "evidential" numbers are green or yellow or red. In many Bohemian municipalities, descriptive numbers are blue, black, or are not unified. In Brno and some Moravian and Slovak cities, descriptive numbers are white-black signs, orientation numbers are red-white signs. Many cities and municipalities have different rules.

Formerly, Roman numerals signifying the city district were added to the conscription number: e.g. "125/III" means conscription number 125 in district number III (in [[Prague]], this was [[Malá Strana]]). Roman numerals were used both in cities and in village municipalities with more settlements. Nowadays, the name of the settlement is preferred instead of Roman numerals.

The first conscription numbering was ordered by [[Maria Theresa]] in 1770 and implemented in 1770–1771. The series was given successively as the soldiers went through the settlement describing houses with numbers. Thereafter, every new house was allocated the next number sequentially, irrespective of its location. Most villages still use their original number series from 1770–1771. In cities, houses have been renumbered once or more often in order to be sequential{{spnd}}the first wave of renumbering came in 1805–1815. In 1857, the Austrian Emperor allowed a new system of numbering by streets. This new system was introduced in the biggest cities (Prague, Brno) in the 1860s. In 1884, land registration books were introduced and they used the old (conscription) numbers as a permanent and stable identifier of buildings. The new (orientation) numbers continue to be used concurrently.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the European scheme (ascending odd/even numbers, see above) is usually used. In most cases, the numbers increase in the direction away from the town/city centre. Some places use a clockwise scheme for historical reasons, called ''Hufeisennummerierung'' ("horseshoe numbering") due to the progression of the numbers. This includes [[Berlin]], parts of [[Hamburg]] and some other towns in northern Germany.

In some older streets in northern and eastern Germany, mainly in the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and adjoining areas, including parts of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], the "horseshoe" numbering system (counter-clockwise "boustrophedon"-style numbering) was used for the numbering of new streets up until the 1920s, after which the European system was introduced for new streets.

Under the horseshoe numbering scheme, starting from one end, the buildings on the right side of the street were numbered sequentially from the near end to the far end of the street. The next number was then assigned to the last building on the left, opposite side of the street, the following numbers sequentially doubling back along the left side of the street.  The building with the highest number would be the first on the left side, facing building number 1 across the street. The horseshoe numbering system remains in use in older streets in many German cities, notably Berlin, although newer adjoining streets may use modern European numbering. [[Kurfürstendamm]] in Berlin is a well-known example of a street where the horseshoe numbering scheme is still in use, although the numbering today starts with 11 at [[Breitscheidplatz]], with number 237 across the street being the highest number.&lt;ref name=Wittstock&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wittstock |first1=Bernhard |title=Ziffer Zahl Ordnung. Die Berliner Hausnummer von den Anfängen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts bis zur Gegenwart im deutschen und europäischen Kontext. |date=2011 |publisher=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very small villages sometimes number all buildings in the village sequentially according to their date of construction, and independent of the street they are on.  However, this scheme is being phased out because it makes it hard to find a building by its address.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drochtersen hat ein Problem: Das große Durcheinander mit den Hausnummern|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/region/stade/article107538081/Das-grosse-Durcheinander-mit-den-Hausnummern.html|publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt|accessdate=13 January 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former Soviet Union ===
In [[Russia]] and many other former [[USSR]] countries, the European style is generally used, with numbers starting from the end of the street closest to the town center. Buildings or plots at street intersections may be assigned a composite number, which includes the number along the intersecting street separated by a slash ({{lang-ru|дробь}}), like in Нахимова, 14/41 (14 is the number along Nakhimova street and 41 is the number along intersecting street).

The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase; though in some cities (including [[Saint Petersburg]]) the odd numbers are on the right side. Some cities (for example, [[Nizhniy Novgorod]]) have mixed numbering: odd numbers on the right in some parts of the city and on the left in others.

Soviet era housing districts ([[microdistrict]]s) often have a complicated network of access lanes thought too small to merit their own names. Buildings in these lanes are ascribed to larger streets which may be quite far from their location; a building placed along a street may sometimes be ascribed to another street, which sometimes makes finding a building by its address a challenging task.

In some cities, especially hosting large scientific or military research centers in Soviet time, the numbering might be different: houses may have numbers related to the block rather than the street, thus 12-й квартал, дом 3 (Block 12, House 3),&lt;ref name=dxdy&gt;[http://dxdy.ru/topic3547.html Related discussion], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the Japanese and Korean systems (see below). [[Aktau]] is one example of this.

When a numbered plot contains multiple buildings, they are assigned an additional component of the street address, called корпус (building), which is usually a sequentially assigned number unique within the plot (but sometimes contains letters as in 15а, 15б, 15в and so on). So, a Russian street address may look like Московское шоссе, дом 23, корпус 2 (Moscow Street, plot 23, building 2), or Льва Толстого, дом 14б (Leo Tolstoy Street, plot 14, building b).

On very long roads in suburban areas, a kilometer numbering system also may be used (like Australian rural numbering system). For example, 9-й км Воткинского шоссе (9th kilometer of Votkinsk Highway), and Шабердинский тракт, 7-й км (7th kilometer of Shaberdy Road).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Latin America ==
[[File:House numbers meters.jpg|thumb|Distance scheme]]
In Latin America, some countries, like Mexico and Uruguay, use systems similar to those in Europe. Houses are numbered in ascending order from downtown to the border of the city. In Mexico, the cities are usually divided in ''Colonias'', which are small or medium areas. The ''colonia'' is commonly included in the address before the postal code. Sometimes when houses merge in a street or new constructions are built after the numbering was made, the address can become ambiguous. When a number is re-used, a letter is added for the newer address. For example, if there are two 35s, one remains as "35", and the second one becomes "35A" or "35[[wikt:Bis#Latin|Bis]]".

It is sometimes common in remote towns or non-planned areas inside the cities, that the streets do not have any name and the houses do not have numbers. In these cases, the address of the houses are usually the name of a person or family, the name of the area or town, or ''Dirección Conocida'' ("known address"), which means that the house of the family is known by almost all the community. This kind of addressing is only used in remote towns or small communities near highways. For people living near highways or roads, the usual address is the kilometer distance of the road in which the house is established; if there is more than one address, some references might be written or the ''Dirección Conocida'' may be added.

In Uruguay, most house numbering starts at a high number among the hundreds or the thousands. The system is similar to the French-Spanish one: when a house is divided the term 'bis' is added with the difference that no single term designates the third: when a house is divided or added between another the term 'bis' is repeated as many divisions have been made or houses added in between, for example '3217 bis bis' corresponds to the third house from the 3217th, and so on, when many houses are merged the lowest number is used, leaving the in-between numbers missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caravia|first1=Antonio|title=Colección de leyes, decretos y resoluciones gubernativas, tratados tratados internacionales, acuerdos del Tribunal de apelaciones y disposiciones de carácter permanente de la República Oriental del Uruguay|date=1867|publisher=Imp. a vapor de LA TRIBUNA|location=Montevideo|page=278|edition=HARVARD COLLEGE LIBRARY DEC 24 1915 LATIN AMERICAN PROFESSORSHIP FUND.|url=https://books.google.com.uy/books?id=pwIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=numeracion+de+puerta+montevideo&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt6d6co__SAhXCg5AKHWWnD0EQ6AEIHzAB|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also there are cases when no number is assigned, this occurs mostly in peripheral areas inside the cities, low house numbering occurs in small locations and in balneary areas houses are designated by name rather than number.

In countries like [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], a scheme is used also for streets in cities, where the house number is the distance measured in meters from the house to the start of the street. In [[Venezuela]], houses, buildings,  and streets have names instead of numbers.

[[File:Hamilton County Street Address map.png|thumb|House numbers in [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], have a clear spatial pattern; lower in Downtown [[Cincinnati]] and progressively higher further out in the suburbs]]

In the United States and Canada, streets are usually numbered with odd on one side and even on the other.  The specific ordering of the numbers vary based on the policies of the local municipality.  Generally, three different systems exist:

*Streets may be numbered strictly sequentially, starting with 1 at the start of the street, and continuing in order skipping no numbers until the end.  In these cases, if additional addresses are needed to be assigned to new buildings, fractional house numbers may be used, or letter suffixes may be appended to the house number.

*Streets may be numbered from the most recent intersection.  In these cases, numbers progress sequentially from each intersection, but skip to the next set of numbers at each cross street, usually in sets of even 100s.  Thus, the first [[city block|block]] on a street may start at 1, and continue up until the next block, when they start at 101, then 201, and so on.

*Streets may be numbered based on distances, where the house number is based on some mathematical formula according to the distance from the start of the numbering system.

Even within these systems, there is are also two ways to define the starting point for the numbering system.  Some places will start the numbering system at the start of the street itself.  Other places will define a numbering system based on a defined point or line, such as a municipal or county boundary, or a defined intersection near the center of the municipality, with numbers increasing generally as one gets further from the baseline, regardless of where streets start or stop.

'''Joan Robinson''' in her book '''The Accumulation of Capital'''&lt;ref&gt;Joan Robinson, ''The Accumulation of Capital'' (London: Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd., 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1956, propagated a simple growth model, which reflects the working of a pure capitalist economy, also known as the "Joan Robinson's Growth Model". However, the Accumulation of Capital was a terse book and in one of her other books entitled '''Essays in the theory of Economic Growth''',&lt;ref&gt;Joan Robinson, ''Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth'' (London: Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd., 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Hamberg |year=1963 |title=''Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth'' by Joan Robinson |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=1109–1114 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she tried to lower the degree of abstraction. The growth model was propagated in verbal terms, where later on the mathematical formalization was put forward by [[Kenneth K. Kurihara]].

'''Assumptions''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. K. |last=Mishra |first2=V. K. |last2=Puri |title=Economics of Development and Planning |isbn=978-81-8488-829-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is a [[laissez-faire]] [[closed economy]].
# The factors of production are capital and labour only.
# There is neutral technical progress.
# There are only two classes: workers and entrepreneurs among whom the national income is distributed.
# Workers save nothing and spend their wage income on consumption.
# Entrepreneurs consume nothing, but save and invest their entire income for [[capital formation]].
# There is no change in the price level.
# Saving is a function of profit.

==The Model==
The entrepreneurs total profit and the workers total wage bill constitute the Net National Income in Joan Robinson's Growth Model. It can be mathematically expressed as&lt;br /&gt;
'''pY=wN+πpK'''&lt;br /&gt;
where '''Y''' is the net national income, '''w''' is the money wage rate, '''N''' the number of workers employed, '''K''' is the amount of capital utilized, '''p''' is the average price of output as well as of capital and '''π''' is the gross profit rate (including the rate).

'''''Jus sanguinis''''' ({{lang-la|right of blood}}) is a principle of [[nationality law]] by which [[citizenship]] is not determined by place of birth but by having one or both parents who are citizens of the state. Children at birth may automatically be citizens if their parents have state citizenship or national identities of ethnic, cultural, or other origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjqWJCE7JQUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Dora |last=Kostakopoulou |title=The Future Governance of Citizenship |pages=26–27 |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship can also apply to children whose parents belong to a [[diaspora]] and were [[Right of return|not themselves citizens]] of the state conferring citizenship.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This principle contrasts with ''[[jus soli]]'' (Latin: ''right of soil'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/birthright_comparativepaper.pdf |last1=Vink |first1=Maarten Peter |last2=de Groot |first2=Gerard-René |date=November 2010 |title=Birthright Citizenship: Trends and Regulations in Europe |location=Florence |publisher=European University Institute |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern development ==
At the end of the 19th century, the French-German debate on nationality saw the French, such as [[Ernest Renan]], oppose the German conception, exemplified by [[Johann Fichte]], who believed in an "objective nationality", based on [[heredity|blood]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[language]]. Renan's [[republicanism|republican]] conception, but perhaps also the presence of a German-speaking population in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], explains France's early adoption of ''jus soli''.

=== Mixed standards ===
Many nations have a mixture of ''jus sanguinis'' and ''jus soli'', including the [[United States nationality law|United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gansallo|first1=Ayodele|last2=Bernstein-Baker|first2=Judith|title=Understanding Immigration Law and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9781454850380|page=570|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u90uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA570|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian nationality law|Canada]], [[Israeli nationality law|Israel]], [[Greek nationality law|Greece]], the [[Irish nationality law|Republic of Ireland]], and recently [[German nationality law|Germany]]. Today [[French nationality law]] narrowly applies ''jus sanguinis,'' but it is still the most common means of passing on citizenship in many [[Continental Europe|continental European]] nations.

=== Complications due to imposed boundaries ===
Some modern European states which arose out of the dissolved [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires have huge numbers of ethnic populations outside of their new 'national' boundaries, as do most of the [[former Soviet states]]. Such long-standing diasporas do not conform to codified 20th-century European rules of citizenship.

In many cases, ''jus sanguinis'' rights are mandated by international treaty, with citizenship definitions imposed by the international community. In other cases, minorities are subject to legal and extra-legal persecution and choose to immigrate to their ancestral home country. States offering ''jus sanguinis'' rights to ethnic citizens and their descendants include [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]]  and [[Romania]]. Each is required by international treaty to extend those rights.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

At one time, ethnic Germans living abroad in a country in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] (Aussiedler) could obtain citizenship through a virtually automatic procedure.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Federal Expellee Law]] ({{lang-de|Bundesvertriebenengesetz}}), §&amp;nbsp;6, specifies that also foreign citizens of states of the Eastern Bloc (and their desdendants), who were persecuted between 1945 and 1990 for their German ethnicity by their respective governments, are entitled to become Germans. The argument was that the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] had to administer to their needs because the respective governments in charge of guaranteeing their equal treatment as citizens severely neglected or contravened that obligation.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 the law has been steadily tightened to limit the number of immigrants each year. It now requires immigrants to prove language skills and cultural affiliation. Article 116(2) entitles persons (and their descendants), who were denaturalised by the Nazi government, to be renaturalised if they wish. Those among them who took their residence in Germany after May 8, 1945, are automatically to be considered as Germans.

*{{flag|Haiti|name}}: Every child born to a Haitian father or mother, no matter where he or she was born, is Haitian by the Haitian Constitution. This has been a big issue in the current Dominican nationality law; because of this and other factors, illegal migrants' children born in the DR of Haitian origin are considered non-Dominicans, and therefore Haitians.
*{{flag|Hungary|name}}: A person acquires Hungarian citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a Hungarian citizen. The place of birth is irrelevant.  Furthermore, Section 4(3) of the Act on Nationality permits ethnic Hungarians (defined as persons "at least one of whose relatives in ascendant line was a Hungarian citizen") to obtain citizenship on preferential terms after one year of residence. In addition, the "Status Law" of 2001 grants certain privileges to ethnic Hungarians living in territories that were once part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It permits them to obtain an identification card but does not confer the right to full Hungarian citizenship. According to the latest Citizenship Law adopted in 2010, anybody, possessing certain evidences (certificates, documents) of his or her Hungarian roots from around the World can apply for Hungarian citizenship. The interview is led in Hungarian either in Hungary or at one of the Consulates abroad.

*{{flag|India|name}}: A child born in India must have at least one parent who is an Indian citizen to be conferred citizenship. Earlier, people born in India were given citizenship regardless of the citizenship held by parents, but this was changed on 3 December 2004. Persons with at least one Indian grandparent may apply for a [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Person of Indian Origin]] card, provided that neither the applicant nor any ancestor has ever been a citizen of [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Afghanistan]], or [[China]]. The government may add other countries to the list. This card is a travel document and permits the holder to enter and stay in India without a visa, work, start a business, own land, and attend educational institutions, but it does not give the right to vote or hold office. In addition, persons of Indian origin who are nationals of countries not on the list may apply for [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|Overseas citizenship of India]], which confers similar rights and also permits the holder to apply for full Indian nationality after one year of residence.
*{{flag|Ireland|name}}: Under [[Irish nationality law]], any person with an Irish grandparent can become an Irish citizen by being registered in the Foreign Births Register at an Irish embassy or consular office, or at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. Such an individual may also pass his entitlement to Irish nationality on to his children by registering in the Foreign Births Register, provided he or she registered as an Irish citizen with the Foreign Births Register before the birth of those children. The minister may also waive the usual requirements for naturalisation as an Irish citizen for those of "Irish descent or Irish associations" although this power is rarely used.
*{{flag|Iran|name}}: According to the [[Iranian nationality law]] the following persons are considered to be Iranian subjects: (1) All persons residing in Iran except those whose foreign nationality is established; the foreign nationality of such persons is considered to be established if their documents of nationality have not been objected to by the Iranian Government. (2) Those born in Iran or outside whose fathers are Iranian. (3) Those born in Iran of unknown parentage.(4)Persons born in Iran of foreign parents, one of whom was also born in Iran. (5) Persons born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their naturalization as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. (6) Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband. (7) Every foreign national who has obtained Iranian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.princeton.edu/irandataportal/laws/institutionsgovernance/nationality-law/ |title=Nationality Law: Article 976 |work=Iran Data Portal: Princeton University |year=2015 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Israel|name}}: [[Israeli nationality law]] confers citizenship upon all children of Israeli citizens born in Israel, as well as the first generation of descendants of Israeli expatriates living abroad.

*Kenya: According to Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 a person becomes a citizen by birth if on the day of the person birth either parent is a citizen of Kenya
*{{flag|Malta|name}}: [[Maltese nationality law]] grants citizenship to any person descended from "an ascendant who was born in Malta of a parent who was also born in Malta."
*{{flag|Mexico|name}}  The Mexican Constitution (Article 30) indicates that Mexicans are also persons born abroad, to a parent or parents who at that time were Mexicans born in Mexican territory. Also, a person born abroad is also Mexican, if at the time of birth either or both parents were Mexicans by naturalization. Mexico’s Constitution considers them Mexicans by birth.
* {{flag|Norway|name}}: [[Norwegian nationality law]]
* {{flag|Nigeria|name}}: According to the [[Constitution of Nigeria|Nigerian Constitution]], Chapter 3, section 25 1C
*{{flag|Philippines|name}}: The [[Philippine nationality law]] is based upon the principles of jus sanguinis (Latin: right of blood) and therefore descent from a parent who is a citizen or national of the [[Republic of the Philippines]] is the primary method of acquiring Philippine citizenship.
*{{flag|Poland|name}}: The definition of Polish citizenship has been based for years on article 34 of the Polish Constitution; this article is based on a '''jus sanguinis''' right to citizenship.&lt;ref name="Poland"&gt;English [http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kMEKJXyM?url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm |date=7 October 2009 }} of the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, any child born by Polish parent(s) is a ''de jure'' citizen of Poland. In 1967–1968 the Communist State issued to Jews emigrating from Poland to Israel, instead of passports, a so-called travel document which granted them the right to exit Poland but not of re-entering it, in effect taking away their Polish citizenship on the assumption that, in emigrating or traveling to Israel, they renounced it themselves. In a 2005 verdict, the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland]] ruled that this action was illegal based on the state of law at that time. Consequently, it is now assumed the Jews who emigrated after 1968 have remained Polish citizens and their citizenship will be certified on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/124944/Emigrantom-z-1968-roku-zostana-zwrocone-obywatelstwa/ |title=Emigrantom z 1968 roku zostaną zwrócone obywatelstwa |trans-title=Polish citizenship reinstated to emigrants from 1968 |work=[[Wprost]] |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2015 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Romania|name}}: [[Romanian nationality law]]
*{{flag|Slovakia|name}}: Persons with at least one Slovak grandparent and "Slovak cultural and language awareness" may apply for an expatriate identity card entitling them to live, work, study and own land in Slovakia. Expatriate status is not full citizenship and does not entitle the holder to vote, but a holder who moves his or her domicile to Slovakia may obtain citizenship under preferential terms.  Slovakia grants full Slovak citizenship to children of Slovak parents (one or both parents) irrespective of the place of birth.
*{{flag|South Korea|name}}: [[South Korean nationality law]]
* {{flag|Sweden|name}}: [[Swedish nationality law]]
*{{flag|Switzerland|name}}: [[Swiss nationality law#Jus sanguinis|Swiss nationality law]] is exceptionally restrictive: someone who was born in Switzerland and has spent their entire life there has no automatic right to Swiss citizenship if neither of their parents are Swiss citizens, even if their parents are permanent residents or have themselves spent their entire lives in Switzerland. In fact, the citizenship criteria are simpler for a foreigner with no previous ties to Switzerland who marries a Swiss citizen, than for people born and raised in Switzerland but with foreign parents. Due to Switzerland's [[Immigration to Switzerland|high immigrant population]], there are more than a million people who were born and have spent their entire lives in Switzerland but are not Swiss citizens due to their parents being immigrants. Some Swiss-born third-generation immigrants even have Swiss-born parents but are not Swiss citizens if neither of their parents have naturalised. To obtain Swiss citizenship, people in this position must undergo [[Swiss nationality law#Naturalisation|naturalisation proceedings]], which have a high bar to satisfy the "integration" criterion. The unusual rules hit international headlines in 2017 when a woman born in Switzerland to [[Turkey|Turkish]] parents, who is a native [[Swiss German|Swiss-German]] speaker and has spent her entire life in Switzerland, had her citizenship application denied by the local municipality on "integration" grounds as she could not name enough Swiss mountains, cheeses and retail brands, and was deemed not to have gone skiing often enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/aarau/das-einbuergerungs-protokoll-diese-92-fragen-musste-funda-yilmaz-beantworten-131524081|title=Das Einbürgerungs-Protokoll: Diese 92 Fragen musste Funda Yilmaz beantworten|work=az Aargauer Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-06|language=de-CH|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406232859/https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/aarau/das-einbuergerungs-protokoll-diese-92-fragen-musste-funda-yilmaz-beantworten-131524081|archive-date=6 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was overruled by the cantonal government several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/naturalisation-row_decision-to-deny-citizenship-to-turkish-woman-reversed/43609038|title=Decision to deny citizenship to Turkish woman reversed|last=agencies|first=swissinfo.ch and|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407053402/https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/naturalisation-row_decision-to-deny-citizenship-to-turkish-woman-reversed/43609038|archive-date=7 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Swiss voters in a nationwide [[Swiss referendums, 2017|referendum]] agreed to relax the citizenship criteria for third-generation immigrants: although they will still not be Swiss citizens at birth and will need to apply for citizenship, they will no longer have to take naturalisation tests or interviews if their parents ''and'' grandparents are long-time permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38947518|title=Swiss vote for relaxed citizenship laws|date=2017-02-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616002429/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38947518|archive-date=16 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20170212/Federal-Decree-on-the-Simplified-Naturalisation-of-Third-Generation-Immigrants.html|title=Federal Decree on the Simplified Naturalisation of Third-Generation Immigrants|last=Council|first=The Federal|website=www.admin.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406230728/https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20170212/Federal-Decree-on-the-Simplified-Naturalisation-of-Third-Generation-Immigrants.html|archive-date=6 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Thailand|name}}: [[Thai nationality law]]
*{{flag|Tunisia|name}}: When one of the parents is Tunisian, a child is considered Tunisian regardless of the child’s place of birth or whether the child has acquired the nationality of another country. Children with at least one Tunisian parent, no matter where they are born, are considered Tunisian citizens, and must travel to and from Tunisia only with a Tunisian passport.
*{{flag|Ukraine|name}}: Article 8 of the Law on Citizenship of Ukraine permits any person with at least one Ukrainian grandparent to become a citizen upon renunciation of the former nationality.
*{{flag|United Kingdom|name}}: By birth abroad, which constitutes "by descent" if one of the parents is a British citizen otherwise than by descent (for example by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK). British citizenship by descent is only transferable to one generation down from the parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, if the child is born abroad.
*{{flag|United States|name}}: [[United States nationality law]] states that a child born abroad is given United States citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen or national, subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html|title=Acquisition of U.S. Citizenship by a Child Born Abroad|author=|date=|website=travel.state.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leges sanguinis states today ==
Many countries provide citizenship on preferential terms to individuals with ethnic ties to these countries (so-called ''leges sanguinis''):
*{{flag|Afghanistan|name}}: Connection to the Afghan diaspora. There have been controversial proposals to people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin.
*{{flag|Armenia|name}}: Article 14 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Armenia]] (1995) provides that "individuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/am00000_.html |title=Constitution of the Republic of Armenia |work=International Constitutional Law Project |date=5 July 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is consistent with the [[Declaration on Independence of Armenia]], issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that "Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia".
*{{flag|Bulgaria|name}}: Article 25 of the 1991 constitution specifies that a "person of Bulgarian origin shall acquire Bulgarian citizenship through a facilitated procedure." Article 15 of the Law on Bulgarian Citizenship provides that an individual "of Bulgarian origin" (ethnicity) may be naturalized without any waiting period and without having to show a source of income, knowledge of the Bulgarian language, or renunciation of his former citizenship. This approach has been a tradition since the new constitutional foundation of Bulgaria in 1879, following the liberation from Ottoman yoke in 1878, when large numbers of ethnic Bulgarians remained outside of the state borders. Bulgaria and Greece were subject to a population exchange following the [[Second Balkan War]]. The conditions of the treaty settlement mandated that they accept individuals claiming respective ethnic origin.
*{{flag|Croatia|name}}: Article 11 of the Law on Croatian Citizenship allows emigrants and their descendants to acquire Croatian nationality upon return, without passing a language examination or renouncing former citizenship. In addition, Article 16 allows ethnic Croats living outside Croatia to "acquire Croatian citizenship" by making a written declaration and by submitting proof of attachment to Croatian culture.
*{{flag|Finland|name}}: Finnish law provides a [[right of return]] to ethnic Finns from the former Soviet Union, including [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]]. Applicants must now pass an examination in one of the official languages of the country, Finnish or Swedish. Certain persons of Finnish descent who live outside the former Soviet Union also have the right to establish permanent residency, which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship.
*{{flag|Greece|name}}: Ethnic Greeks can obtain Greek citizenship by two methods under the Code of Greek Nationality. Article 5 allows ethnic Greeks who are stateless (which, in practice, includes those who voluntarily renounce their nationality) to obtain citizenship upon application to a Greek consular official. In addition, ethnic Greeks who join the armed forces acquire automatic citizenship by operation of Article 10, with the military oath taking the place of the citizenship oath. This position arises from the fact that approximately 85% of known ethnic Greeks were outside the boundaries when the country was formed, and 40% remained outside the final boundaries at the beginning of [[World War I]]. Most were ''de jure'' stripped of their host country citizenship with the outbreak of war if the host country was at war with Greece. In the late 19th century, Greece had a wider diaspora because of poverty and limited opportunities.
*{{flag|Ireland|name}} While the child or a grandchild of an Irish citizen parent is automatically Irish, Section 16(a) of the [[Irish nationality law|Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act]] permits the Minister of Justice, at their discretion, to waive the residence requirements for a person "of Irish descent or associations".
*{{flag|Israel|name}}: The [[Law of Return]] offers citizenship to any Jew (see [[Who is a Jew?#Law_of_Return|Who is a Jew under the Law of Return?]]) wishing to immigrate. Exceptions can be made for those considered by the Minister of Interior to be a threat to the welfare or security of the state. Israeli law also recognizes the descendants of Israeli emigrants living abroad as Israelis; this applies only to the first generation born abroad. Non-jews can become naturalized after five years' of residency and acquisition of a basic knowledge of [[Hebrew]].
*{{flag|Italy|name}}: The [[Italian nationality law|nationality law of Italy]] bestows citizenship ''jure sanguinis''. There is no limit of generations for the citizenship via blood. However, the first citizens of the modern Italian state were alive on 17 March 1861 when the state was officially formed, and for this reason all claims of Italian citizenship by jure sanguinis must stem from an ancestor who was living after 16 March 1861. Each descendant of the ancestor through whom citizenship is claimed ''jure sanguinis'' could pass Italian citizenship to the next generation only if this descendant was entitled to Italian citizenship at the time of the birth of the next person in the line. So if any person in the line lost the Italian citizenship and then had a child, that child did not inherit Italian citizenship ''jure sanguinis'', except if the child could inherit the citizenship from the other parent. Cases of dual citizenship were possible, which is to say, for example, that a person in the line could have had Italian and Canadian citizenship concurrently. Minor children of Italian citizens were at risk of losing Italian citizenship if the child's parent naturalized in another country, unless the child was subject to an exception to this risk—and children born and residing in a country where they held dual citizenship by [[jus soli]] were subject to such an exception since 1 July 1912.  Until 1 January 1948, Italian law did not generally permit women to pass on citizenship. Persons born before that date are in most cases not Italian citizens ''jure sanguinis'' if their line of descent from an Italian citizen depends on a female at some point before 1948.  On several occasions, this limitation of deriving Italian citizenship only from fathers before 1948 has been successfully challenged in court.
*{{flag|Kiribati|name}}: Articles 19 and 23 of the constitution provides, "Every person of I-Kiribati descent... shall... become or have and continue to have thereafter the right to become a citizen of Kiribati.... Every person of I-Kiribati descent who does not become a citizen of Kiribati on Independence Day... shall, at any time thereafter, be entitled upon making application in such manner as may be prescribed to be registered as a citizen of Kiribati."
*{{flag|Liberia|name}}: the [[Constitution of Liberia|Liberian constitution]] allows only [[Negro]]s (regardless of cultural or national affiliation) to become citizens, though people of other races may live in Liberia as permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Republic of Liberia|ssrn = 1795122|date = 2009-05-01|location = Rochester, NY|first = Jessie|last = Tannenbaum|first2 = Anthony|last2 = Valcke|first3 = Andrew|last3 = McPherson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Lithuania|name}}: The Constitution of Lithuania grants a right to citizenship to foreigners of ethnic Lithuanian origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/lh00000_.html |title=Constitution of Lithuania: Article 32(4) |work=International Constitutional Law Project |date=25 October 1992 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Rwanda|name}}: The Rwandan constitution provides that "[a]ll persons originating from Rwanda and their descendants shall, upon their request, be entitled to Rwandan nationality."
*{{flag|Serbia|name}}: Article 23 of the 2004 citizenship law provides that the descendants of emigrants from Serbia, or ethnic Serbs residing abroad, may take up citizenship upon written declaration.
*{{flag|Spain|name}}: A Spanish law passed in 2015 allows individuals who can prove descent from the [[Sephardic Jews]] who were exiled in 1492 following the [[Alhambra Decree]] and who can show a "special link" to Spain to apply for dual citizenship. Spain had previously allowed application for such individuals but had required that they give up their citizenship from their other country. The new law has no such requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-spain-sephardic-jews-20151001-story.html|title=Welcome home, 500 years later: Spain offers citizenship to Sephardic Jews|first=Henry|last=Chu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|South Korea|name}}: [[South Korean nationality law]] grants special status to ethnic [[Koreans]] and their descendants in the [[Korean diaspora]]. Under the [[Constitution of South Korea]], North Korea is part of Republic of Korea. Therefore, North Korean citizens are also recognized as South Korean nationals. All North Koreans of good conduct are granted citizenship upon arrival to South Korea.
*{{flag|Turkey|name}}: Turkish law allows persons of Turkish origin and their spouse and children, to apply for naturalization without the five-year waiting period applicable to other immigrants. Turkey and Greece reciprocally expelled their minorities in the early 1920s after World War I.  They were mandated by international treaty to accept incoming populations as citizens based on ethnic background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6600">[[File:Keith Arnatt, 1970.jpg|thumb|Keith Arnatt c. 1970]] Keith Arnatt (1930–2008) was a British conceptual artist. As well as conceptual art his work is sometimes discussed in relation to land art, minimalism, and photography.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson’s essay in the catalogue to the exhibition ‘Conceptual Art in Britain 1964-1979’, Tate, London, 2016, discusses Arnatt. Arnatt exhibited in the 2012 MOCA exhibition ‘Ends of the Earth, Land Art to 1974’. The curators Philipp Kaiser and Miwon Kwon relate Minimalism and Land Art in their introductory essay for the catalogue. See also Anne Seymour’s essay in ‘The New Art’, 1972 (further details note 7). Ian Walker’s essay from the catalogue to Arnatt’s retrospective ‘Rubbish and Recollections’, The Photographers’ Gallery, London, 1989, discusses his use of the camera.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived and worked in London, Liverpool, Yorkshire and Monmouthshire.

==Life and work==
Arnatt  was born in Oxford.

He had studied painting at Oxford School of Art in the early 1950s and later at the Royal Academy Schools in London. From 1962 he taught at Liverpool and then, until 1969, Manchester. At this time he was living in and working from a farmhouse on the Yorkshire/Lancashire border. In 1969 he moved to Tintern in Monmouthshire. Liverpool (the beach at Formby); the moors around his farmhouse in Todmorden, Yorkshire; and his garden surrounded by woodland in Tintern, are settings for works.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, ''Liverpool Beach Burial'', 1968 http://www.keitharnatt.com/works/w18.html
‘Situations’ on the Yorkshire Moors 1967-68 http://www.keitharnatt.com/works/w01.html
''Self-Burial'', 1969, http://www.keitharnatt.com/works/w20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1960s Arnatt’s work was associated with the new conceptual art movement. A number of writers connected conceptual art with a general reductionist tendency in contemporary art of the time using phrases like ‘dematerialization’&lt;ref&gt;For instance in Lucy Lippard’s, ‘Six years: the dematerialization of the art object from 1966 to 1972’. Praeger, New York. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and referring to the influence of minimalism and in particular the influence of Robert Morris in relating the presentation of art objects to the contexts of their viewing in a way that sought to activate those contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See Anne Seymour’s reference to Robert Morris’s use of mirrors in connection with Arnatt’s work in ‘The New Art’ catalogue, Hayward Gallery, London, 1972, p66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnatt took part in a number of influential exhibitions of conceptual art including 'Konzeption-Conception, Städtichen Museum, Leverkusen', 1969; 'Information', MoMA, New York, 1970; 'Umwelt-Akzente / Die Expansion der Kunst', Kunstkreis Monschau, 1970 and 'Art as Idea in England', CAYC (Centro de Arte y Comunicación), Buenos Aires, 1971.

Some works from this period, including ''Self-Burial'' in the version documenting the WDR televised ''Self-Burial (Television Interference Project)'' (1969), and ''Trouser-Word Piece'' (1972-89 version) are held in the Tate collection.&lt;ref&gt;Self-Burial (Television Interference Project) (1969) and Trouser-Word Piece (1972-89 version), see Tate collection http://www.tate.org.uk/search?type=artwork&amp;q=keith+arnatt+art+works&lt;/ref&gt; MoMA, New York has an Art + Project authorised time slice of the work ''1220400 - 0000000'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Art + Project, MoMA, New York https://www.moma.org/collection/works/109508&lt;/ref&gt; The Henry Moore Institute&lt;ref&gt;The archive of the Henry Moore Institute has slides of early works. Leeds City Art Gallery holds drawings from the early 1960s. Jon Wood’s catalogue to ‘Box, Body, Burial’, the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, 2009, refers to and illustrates these.&lt;/ref&gt; in Yorkshire holds examples of early materials and the V&amp;A Museum&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A collection, London https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/photographs&lt;/ref&gt; has examples of proposals. Some materials that Arnatt gave to Robert Smithson in the form of documentation of proposals were donated to LACMA, Los Angeles by Nancy Holt.&lt;ref&gt;LACMA, Los Angeles https://collections.lacma.org/node/169107&lt;/ref&gt; Tate Archive has material relating to proposals by the artist including correspondence with the writer Barbara Reise. Other works, for example ''I have decided to go to the Tate Gallery next Friday'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keitharnatt.com/img/works/l/I_have_decided.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Art and Egocentricity – A Perlocutionary Act?'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keitharnatt.com/img/works/l/ArtandEgocentricity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were visual/textual hybrids and were intended to be realised in specific circumstances.

From the mid 1970s onwards ''The Visitors'' (1974-6), ''Walking the Dog'' (1976-9), ''Gardeners'' (1978-9), ''A.O.N.B.'' (1982-5)&lt;ref&gt;''The Visitors'' (1974-6) shown in ‘Time, Words and the Camera: Photoworks by British Artists’, Kunstlerhaus, Graz, Oct 10–Nov 07 1976, and ‘Arte inglese oggi 1960–1976 / English Art Today 1960–1976’, Pilazzo Reale, Milan, Feb 26–May 16 1976. ''Walking the Dog'' (1976-9) and ''Gardeners'' (1978-9) were shown at Anthony d’Offay, London, Nov 21–Dec 21 1979. ''A.O.N.B.'' (1982-5), ''Miss Grace's Lane'' (1986-7) and ''Howler's Hill'' (1987-8) at Keith Arnatt ‘Rubbish and Recollections’, The Photographers’ Gallery, London, Jun 02–Jul 15 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and series such as ''Miss Grace's Lane'' (1986-7) and ''Howler's Hill'' (1987-8) make directly realist evidential references in their uses of settings. Here, where Arnatt was using the camera in a first-order way and there has been some theorising over the extent of his influence on contemporary photographic practice, there still remains an overriding continuity in the form of analytic and self-disclosing interests in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Arnatt was consistently ironic in references to photography&lt;/ref&gt; In late series like ''Painter’s Cans'' (1990), ''Notes from Jo'' (1991-95), and ''Labels Borrowed/Stolen'' (1993-95)&lt;ref&gt;Notes from Jo (1991-95), and Labels Borrowed/Stolen (1993-95) recently shown at Sprüth Magers, ‘Notes’, September 14 to November 02 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnatt continued to investigate objects with something very close to the type of manipulative detachment originally shown in early works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1154">The '''lecherous millionaire''' is a [[thought experiment]] devised by [[Joel Feinberg]] to illustrate questions concerning [[coercion]]. It presents a scenario in which a millionaire offers to pay for medical care for a woman's ill child on the condition that she has sexual relations with him. While the millionaire is making an offer, he nevertheless seems to be coercing the woman.

'''Mediology''' (French: ''médiologie''), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of [[cultural transmission]] in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.

==Overview==
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]] in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book ''Le pouvoir intellectuel en France'', (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's ''Transmitting Culture'' (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.

The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.

Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as [[media sociology]] is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as [[semiotics]] does). It differs from the models put forward by [[communication studies]], in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of [[religion]]s, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology "would like to bring to light the function of [[Media (communication)|medium]] in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any [[milieu]]. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty [[linguistic]] or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combine to produce things such as [[rituals]], [[architecture]], [[flags]], special sites, customs, [[typefaces]] and [[book binding]]s, smells and sounds, [[body language|bodily gestures and postures]], all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.

Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the [[bicycle]], which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early [[modernist]] art and cinema.

A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g. how [[painting]] and [[early photography]] influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, [[telegraph]] and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).

Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] (whom he sees as being overly [[Technological determinism|technologically determinist]]), and of the French [[sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also tries to step beyond [[Antonio Gramsci]], in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article.  The first, by the screenwriter [[Yvette Biro|Yvette Bíró]] (''Wide Angle'' magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's ''Vie et Mort de l'Image'', in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar [[Marxist]] school of thought".

The second review, by [[Pramod Nayor]] of the University of Hyderabad (''Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'', Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of ''Transmitting Culture'' (2004).  In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School cultural studies]] ranging from "[[Raymond Williams]] through [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites [[Bruno Latour]], [[Eugene Thacker]] and [[Dwight Atkinson]] - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"

An article by Steven Maris in ''Fibreculture'' No.12 [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_maras.html] similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media".

Physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] have criticized Debray's work for using [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main;jsessionid=DCNAOEIEBKEB?ISUM_ID=center&amp;ISUM_SCR=nwExternalServiceScr&amp;ISUM_CIPH=T9aJnOHAgwQV8T2hIQ5D3Du3v4I5zbXVbG3CxvkJy7s_&amp;ISUM_URL=rtE--JVQ7nRU10QjZURxmHAxjLLIW3DXPzmc29-XDq1dc8FTO2YT0563J3xcF8aK |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160928/http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main |archivedate=August 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticisms, the six-volume ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

'''Naomi Scheman''' is a Professor of Philosophy and Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Naomi Scheman|url=http://www.philosophy.umn.edu/people/FacultyProfile.php?UID=nschema|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheman|first=Naomi|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://apps.cla.umn.edu/directory/items/cv/294560.doc|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a guest professor at the [[Umeå University|Umeå Center for Gender Studies]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  Scheman was one of the first scholars to bring [[Wittgenstein]]'s thoughts in to feminist philosophy.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

==Education and career==
Scheman received her bachelor's in philosophy from [[Barnard College]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She went on to receive a master's and doctorate in philosophy from [[Harvard University]], in 1971 and 1978, respectively.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Scheman is currently a professor at University of Minnesota, and a guest professor at [[Umeå University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  During her time at the University of Minnesota, she served as the chair of the Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies department from 1986-1989, and has served as the Director of Graduate Studies since 2007.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  Prior to her current positions, Scheman has held appointments at the [[University of Ottawa]],  [[Columbia University]], the [[Center for Advanced Feminist Studies]] (including serving as director from 1991-1992 and associate dean of the graduate school from 2000-2003,) and the [[University of Gothenburg]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Scheman also serves as a member of the editorial boards of ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'' and ''NORA (the Nordic Women's Studies Journal)''.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She also served as an associate editor of ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'' between 1990 and 1993.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas==
Scheman was one of the first academics to read [[Wittgenstein]] in a feminist light, and, likewise, was one of the first academics to bring Wittgenstein's ideas to feminism.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=June 2012: Naomi Scheman|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/june2012naomischeman|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Scheman's work has centered around the implications of the interactions between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  Scheman is especially interested in the ways in which transgressive practices shine light on the actions of [[normative|normal people]], and on how insights gleaned from these observations allow for the chance of acting differently.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; (Scheman is also a strong believer that mental phenomena such as race and class are socially constructed, and is a strong opponent of [[physicalism]].)&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

==Publications==
Scheman has written three books: ''Engenderings: Constructions of Knowledge, Authority, and Privilege'' in 1993,&lt;ref name=engender&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheman | first = Naomi | title = Engenderings : constructions of knowledge, authority, and privilege | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780415907408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Is Academic Feminism Dead?'' in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Social Justice Group at the Center for Advanced Feminist Studies, University of Minnesota | first = The | title = Is academic feminism dead?: theory in practice | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780814727058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Feminist Interpretations of Wittgenstein'' in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Scheman | first1 = Naomi | last2 = O'Connor | first2 = Peg | author-link2 = Peg O'Connor | title = Feminist interpretations of Ludwig Wittgenstein | publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press | location = University Park, Pennsylvania | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780271021980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently ''Shifting Ground: Knowledge &amp; Reality, Transgression &amp; Trust'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheman | first = Naomi | title = Shifting ground knowledge and reality, transgression and trustworthiness | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195395105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written a significant number of peer-reviewed papers, as well as a number of articles, commentaries, and presentations including.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

===Engenderings: Constructions of Knowledge, Authority, and Privilege===
In ''Engenderings: Constructions of Knowledge, Authority, and Privilege'',&lt;ref name=engender /&gt; Scheman critiques aspects of modern philosophy that serve or reinforce injustice.&lt;ref name=minnich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamarck Minnich|first=Elizabeth|title=Engenderings: Constructions of Knowledge, Authority, and Privilege by Naomi Scheman|journal=Gender and Society|date=February 1995|volume=9|issue=1|pages=125–126|doi=10.2307/189604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is structured as a collection of essays.&lt;ref name=metaphilosophy&gt;{{cite journal|last=ANTONY|first=LOUISE M.|title=Symposium: Feminist Epistemology: COMMENT ON NAOMI SCHEMAN|journal=Metaphilosophy|date=1 July 1995|volume=26|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1995.tb00567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She focuses especially on modern philosophy's apparent disdain for the body from which it, by necessity, sprung, and attempts to reground philosophy in the physical bodies and relationships it arose from.&lt;ref name=minnich/&gt; Much of ''Engenderings'' draws on Scheman's personal experience as a woman philosopher, attempting to figure out how to occupy the role of 'woman philosopher' while making as few concessions to the culture of intellectual privilege that led her to occupy that identity in the first place as possible.&lt;ref name=tpr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovibond|first=Sabina|title=Engenderings: Constructions of Knowledge, Authority and Privilege. by Naomi Scheman|journal=The Philosophical Review|date=July 1995|volume=104|issue=4|pages=460–462|doi=10.2307/2185637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[modal logic]], a term is said to be a '''non-rigid designator''' (or '''flaccid designator''') or '''connotative term''' if it does not extensionally designate (denote, refer to) the same object in all [[possible worlds]]. This is in contrast to a [[rigid designator]], which does designate the same object in all possible worlds in which that object exists, and does not designate anything else in those worlds in which that object does ''not'' exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Revised Second Edition |year=2008 |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Saul Kripke]] in his 1970 lecture series at [[Princeton University]], later published as the book ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Naming and Necessity]] |year=1980 |last=Kripke |first=Saul |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As an example, consider the phrase "The 43rd [[President of the United States|President]] of the United States of America": while the 43rd President of the United States is ''actually'' [[George W. Bush]], things might have been different. Bush might have lost the election, meaning that the 43rd President might have been [[Al Gore]] or [[Ralph Nader]] instead. (''How remote'' these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for [[many-worlds interpretation|physics]] and [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactualism]].) "The 43rd President of the United States of America" is thus a non-rigid designator, picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds, Al Gore in others, and yet other people in other worlds.

Non-rigid designators are defined by contrast with Kripke's notion of a rigid designator, which picks out the same thing uniquely in ''every'' possible world; while there are possible worlds in which the 43rd President of the United States is Al Gore instead of George W. Bush, there are ''no'' possible worlds where ''George W. Bush'' is anyone other than the man who, in fact, he is. (There ''are'' worlds where some person other than George W. Bush is ''named'' "George W. Bush," but that's neither here nor there.)  Kripke uses this apparent asymmetry to argue (in ''Naming and Necessity'') that no [[definite description]] can be the meaning of a [[proper name]], because names must always be rigid designators, while definite descriptions can designate non-rigidly.

==Criticism==
Some philosophers, such as [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]], have expressed doubt as to whether non-rigid expressions ought to be called ''designators'' at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Varieties of Reference |year=1982 |last=Evans |first=Gareth |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27126">'''Peace psychology''' is a subfield of [[psychology]] and [[peace research]] that deals with the psychological aspects of [[peace]], [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], [[violence]], and [[war]]. Peace psychology can be characterized by four interconnected pillars: (1) research, (2) education, (3) practice, and (4) advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.peacepsych.org/peace-resources.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The first pillar, research, is documented most extensively in this article.

Peace psychological activities are based on psychological models (theories) and methods; they are usually normatively bound in their means and objectives by working towards the ideal of sustainable peace using (as far as possible) non-violent means. Violence and peace are usually defined in terms of [[Johan Galtung|Johan Galtung's]] extended conceptualization of peace,&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (1969). Violence, peace, and peace research. ''Journal of Peace Research, 6'' (3), 167-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (1990). Cultural violence. ''Journal of Peace Research, 27'' (3), 291-305.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which peace is not merely the absence of personal (direct) violence and war (= negative peace), but also the absence of structural (indirect) and cultural violence (= [[positive peace]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christie, D. J., Wagner, R. V., &amp; Winter, D. D. (2001). Introduction to peace psychology. In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, &amp; D. D. Winter (Eds.), ''Peace, conflict, and violence: Peace psychology for the 21st century'' (pp. 1-13). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal of peace can also be conceptualized as the comprehensive implementation of [[human rights]] (civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights); this should, among other purposes, ensure the satisfaction of basic human needs, such as positive personal and social identity, sense of control, security, (social) justice, well-being, a safe environment, and access to adequate food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Tropp, L. R. (2012). Understanding and responding to intergroup conflict: Toward an integrated analysis. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 3-10). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that focus on peace psychology include, for example, in the United States the Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence (Peace Psychology Division [Division 48] of the [[American Psychological Association]]) and Psychologists for Social Responsibility, a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.psysr.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has the Forum Friedenspsychologie,&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.friedenspsychologie.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Psychological Society has an Interest Group called Psychologists for Peace. On the international level, there is the Committee for the Psychological Study of Peace as well as the International Network of Psychologists for Social Responsibility, which links organizations from (among other countries) Germany, Finland, the United States, Australia, Costa Rica, India, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.inspsysr.org/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research ==

Peace psychological research can be analytically (research ''on'' peace) or normatively (research ''for'' peace) oriented. Regardless of its analytical or normative orientation, peace psychological research mainly deals with the ''psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts'' (including war), the ''psychosocial conditions conducive or detrimental to a sustainable peace'', and the ''psychosocial effects of war and violence''. In each case, different levels of analysis and explanation are relevant: from the level of individuals to groups, social organizations and institutions, states and state systems (e.g., the [[European Union]]), military alliances (e.g., [[NATO]]), and collective security systems (e.g., the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] [OSCE]).

=== Formation and escalation of conflict ===

Peace psychology focuses on the psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts. A [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] exists when the expectations, interests, needs, or actions of at least two parties to the conflict are perceived by at least one of the parties to be incompatible. Peace psychology is mainly concerned with conflicts between social groups (intergroup conflicts, such as between ethnic groups, clans, religious groups, states etc.), in terms of domains like power, wealth, access to raw materials and markets, cultural or religious values, honor, dignity, or recognition. In conflicts one has to distinguish between (overt) positions (e.g., " we don't negotiate with X") and underlying interests (e.g., power, spheres of influence and wealth) as well as between current triggers (e.g., violence at a political protest) and systematic, enduring, structural causes (e.g., deprivation of a group's political participation or access to professional employment). Although conflicts are inevitable and can lead to positive change when dealt with constructively,&lt;ref&gt;Kriesberg, L. (2007). ''Constructive conflicts: From escalation to resolution'' (3rd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; the escalation of conflicts and in particular the occurrence of violence are preventable. Psychological processes of information processing (attention, perception, memory, thinking, judgment), emotion, and motivation influence substantially how a conflict is handled, and in particular whether conflicts escalate to violent episodes. An important factor is the different points of view of the conflict parties, such as when behavior that is based on positive intentions is perceived by the opponent as aggressive and therefore contributes to escalation. Conflicts can easily escalate. A cycle of violence can arise in which both parties are involved, and original victims can become perpetrators, without realizing it ("victim myth").&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Tal, D. &amp; Hammack, P. L. (2012). Conflict, delegitimization, and violence. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 29-52). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicts can be intensified specifically through the construction of [[Enemy Image|enemy images]], [[psychological warfare]], and [[propaganda]] promulgated by the media, political elite, educational systems, socialization, cultural symbols and other means. [[Enemy Image|Enemy images]] may have a kernel of truth, but overstate the negative sides of the opponent. The core features of a strong enemy image include: (1) a negative evaluation of the opponent (e.g., aggressive, immoral, but also inferior), (2) a one-sided blame for negative events, and (3) a different evaluation of similar actions of one's own side than the enemy ("double standard"; e.g., build-up of arms on one’s own side is self-defense, on the enemy's it is aggression). These constructions can cause [[dehumanization]] of the opponent, so that moral standards no longer apply.  In extreme cases, it may seem acceptable, even desirable, for the opponent to suffer and be killed. The construction of the enemy image has the central function of justifying armament, violence, and war. In addition, it enhances the individual and collective self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologists for Social Responsibility (2004). Enemy images: A resource material for reducing enmity. Washington, DC: Psychologists for Social Responsibility. http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/Enemyimagesmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological warfare]] includes methods of generating or strengthening war support among the civilian population and the military. These methods include disinformation using the media (war propaganda), but also sabotage, displacement, murder, and terror. War propaganda consists of two complementary strategies: (1) repeating, highlighting, and embellishing with detail information that functions to intensify the enemy image or threat perceptions, and (2) ignoring and devaluing information that may lead to de-escalation. In addition, negative behavior of the adversary may be provoked (e.g., by maneuvers at the state borders) or charges that the enemy engaged in heinous acts may be entirely invented (e.g., the [[Nayirah (testimony)|Nayirah testimony]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, S. (2004). Propaganda und Kriegsberichterstattung. In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 317-329). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict reduction and resolution (peace psychological strategies) ===

Different peace psychological strategies for non-violent conflict resolution are discussed (conflict de-escalation, [[conflict resolution]], [[conflict transformation]]). One can distinguish between strategies on the ''official level'' (e.g., measures of tension reduction and trust build such as Charles E. Osgood's "Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tension Reduction" [GRIT], [[negotiations]], [[mediation]]), approaches of ''unofficial diplomacy'' (interactive problem-solving workshops), and strategies at the level of peace and conflict ''civil society'' (e.g., [[peace journalism]], contact between social groups).

==== Official level ====

Osgood's GRIT model was designed as a counter-concept to the [[arms race]] in the East-West conflict, in which the former superpowers, USA and USSR, constantly increased the quantity and quality of their arms so that the destruction of humankind by a [[nuclear war]] seemed increasingly possible. The GRIT model, in contrast, aimed to de-escalate and create an atmosphere of mutual trust. One party publicly announces and performs a verifiable, concrete step to reduce tension, and asks or invites the other side to do something similar (developing a spiral of trust). Care is taken so that each step does not endanger the safety of one's own side. GRIT was designed to reverse the tension involved in the nuclear arms race by having each side engage in graduated and reciprocal inititiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, C. E. (1962). ''An alternative to war or surrender.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no firm evidence, it has been suggested that U.S. President Kennedy and the Soviet leader Khrushchev based their negotiations after the [[Cuban missile crisis]] on this concept.&lt;ref&gt;Tzeng, O., Landis, D., &amp; Tzeng, D. Y. (2012). Charles E. Osgood's continuing contributions to intercultural communication and far beyond!. ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 36'', 832-842.&lt;/ref&gt;

When conflicted parties are engaged in long-lasting, severe conflicts, it can be difficult to have constructive bilateral negotiations. In this case, a third party (e.g., a social scientist or reputed politician) can serve as a mediator in order to facilitate conflict management. Mediators must be well aware of the conflict and its history, should have the confidence of both conflict parties, and need to be familiar with conflict analysis and communication strategies. Important strategies include establishing trust, working out the essential elements of conflict, and possibly dividing the problem so that at least partial solutions can be achieved and violence can be prevented or stopped. Problems arise when mediators are biased and have strong individual interests. Mediation success is more likely if the conflict is moderately intense, the power difference between the parties is low, and the mediators have high prestige (as a person or because of organizational affiliation).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, S. (2012). Mediation. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unofficial level ====

In severe, long-lasting conflicts, it may be advisable to intervene at a level below official [[diplomacy]]. Interactive problem solving is such an informal approach to bring members of the conflict parties together.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (2002). Interactive problem solving: Informal mediation by the scholar-practitioner. In J. Bercovitch (Ed.), ''Studies in international mediation: Essays in honor of Jeffrey Z. Rubin'' (pp. 167-193). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/node/831&lt;/ref&gt; These can include citizens who are well-respected from different areas of society, such as media, business, politics, education, or religion. A team of social scientists (e.g., psychologists) initiate and promote a problem-solving process with the elements of conflict diagnosis, generation of alternatives, and development of nonviolent solutions that results in outcomes that are satisfactory to all parties involved. There is the expectation or hope that the participants influence their governments and public opinion so that official negotiations can follow. Psychologically important components of the process are that the respective self and enemy images are corrected. Interactive problem solving was used in particular in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] by the U.S. psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] and his team.&lt;ref&gt;d' Estrée, T. P. (2012). Addressing intractable conflict through interactive problem-solving. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 229-251). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil society level ====

Media are often involved in the formation of enemy images and escalation of conflict. [[Peace journalism]], in contrast, has the objective of investigating and using the influence of the media as a means of encouraging the constructive, non-violent resolution of conflict. Key strategies include representing the conflicting parties as well as the conflict and its history appropriately, identifying propaganda, and articulating the suffering of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Kempf, W. (2012). Peace journalism. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[collective action]] and peaceful demonstrations of the population toward peaceful and socially just ends can have an influence on the decisions of those in power – particularly in democracies. Citizens' commitment depends, among other factors, on the existence of opportunities in society, individual value orientations (e.g., valuing non-violence, social justice), the presence of role models, and the perceived probability of success of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke, K., &amp; Shani, M. (2012). Activism, antiwar. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopidia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacts between opposing groups (e.g., on the level of municipalities, associations, universities, trade unions) can contribute to building positive relationships and the reduction of prejudice (see [[contact hypothesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The nature of prejudice.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2011). ''When groups meet: The dynamics of intergroup contact.'' New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, U., &amp; Hewstone, M. (2012). Intergroup contact. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 193-209). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions associated with the improvement of intergroup relations when groups come in contact with one another include: The actors involved have similar social status; there are common goals that can be achieved through cooperation; and the contacts are supported by authorities in society.

In [[asymmetric conflicts]], where one conflict party is politically, economically, and/or militarily clearly superior, the stronger party may not be interested in a truly sustainable conflict resolution. Under asymmetric conditions, when the root causes of the conflict cannot be sufficiently addressed, structural violence persists. For such situations, approaches have been developed such as [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[liberation psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., &amp; Sonn, C. C. (Eds.) (2009). ''Psychology of liberation: Theory and applications.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; which originated in Latin America and is related to [[liberation theology]].

[[Nonviolent resistance]] refers to public, non-violent behavior directed against injustice; it involves publicly explicating one's own intentions, committing to communicate with the other side, and the willingness to endure negative consequences of one's own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bläsi, B. (2004). Gewaltfreier Widerstand. In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 412-424). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of nonviolent resistance range from protests (e.g., demonstrations) to non-cooperation (e.g., strikes, boycotts) to [[civil resistance]] (e.g., traffic blockades). Particularly well known are the actions, speeches, and writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King]].

=== Effects of war and violence ===

Peace psychology examines war and violence between groups also with the aim of illustrating the psychological and social costs of war and violence and to document the human suffering caused. The psychological consequences include, in particular, [[Psychological trauma|traumatization]] (mainly of the civilian population, but also members of the military), cognitive and emotional damage, and the destruction of trustful social relationships. Wars often do not resolve the underlying problems; they often provoke new violence and wars. For example, in post-war societies an increased level of family and community violence can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Macnair, R. M. (2012). Traumatic stress, perpetration-induced. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, resources necessary to deal with civilian issues (e.g., education, health, social welfare) are lost. There is still little comprehensive and objective research on the consequences and costs of war.&lt;ref&gt;Kantner, E. (2007). ''Shock and awe hits home: U.S. health costs of the war in Iraq.'' Washington, DC: Physicians for Social Responsibility. http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/shock-and-awe.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosocial conditions of sustainable peace ===

Even when violence has been stopped or a [[Peace Treaty]] reached, to prevent the risk of a renewed escalation, physical and economic reconstruction as well as socio-political and psychosocial interventions are required. These interventions aim to cure psychosocial wounds of war, build trust, develop a common [[collective memory]], recognize past wrongdoing, and achieve [[conflict resolution|reconciliation]] and/or [[forgiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamber, B. (2009). ''Transforming societies after political violence: Truth, reconciliation, and mental health.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are trauma therapy and [[truth commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commissions]].

Also, irrespective of any specific conflict and violence, peace psychological research looks at the psychosocial conditions that hamper or promote sustainable peace. The basic aim is to transform cultures of violence into cultures of [[peace]].&lt;ref name="De Rivera"&gt;De Rivera, J. (2012). Culture of peace. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cultural characteristics are obstacles to the development of sustainable peace: the view of one's own group (ethnicity, religion, nation, etc.) to be superior and more valuable and others as inferior and of little value (or in the extreme case: no value); the development of enemy images, [[dehumanization]] of others, legitimization of violence and damage; underlying beliefs (ideologies) such as [[ethnocentrism]], [[social dominance orientation]], [[authoritarianism]], [[nationalism]], [[militarism]], and an education system that promotes these ideologies; power differentials that are defended or increased by the powerful and that create unequal conditions in areas such as wealth, health, education, and political participation ([[structural violence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, A. (2004). Kultur und Krieg In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 383-396). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among factors conducive to the development of sustainable peace are: the fundamental belief that conflicts are frequent, but that they can be solved without violence and for the benefit of the various conflict parties; the concept of [[humanism]] with the features of human dignity, [[pacifism]], [[empathy]], [[respect]], tolerance and [[solidarity]], and respect for all people or for humanity as a whole; critical proximity to one's own group that – in addition to positive identification – also integrates own weaknesses, mistakes, and committed wrongdoings in the collective self-concept.&lt;ref name="De Rivera" /&gt;

In the transformation of cultures of violence into cultures of peace the focus on [[human rights]] is of high importance. Human rights are inalienable rights that apply to all human beings, without distinction as to sex, color, ethnicity, language, religion, political opinion, or social origin (prohibition of discrimination). The UN Human Rights Charter contains the essential documents of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR, 1948) and the Twin Covenants (1966, [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]). The UDHR consists of 30 articles with more than 100 individual rights, including civil and political rights (e.g., right to life, prohibition of torture, right to fair and public trial, right to asylum, freedom of speech, regular elections), but also social, economic, and cultural rights (including the right to work, rest, holidays with pay, protection from unemployment, the right to food, clothing, housing, medical care, and free primary education). Of particular importance in the UN's human rights concept is that all human rights are significant (indivisibility) and that they apply to all people (universality). Psychological research on human rights has mainly examined knowledge, attitudes, and readiness to act in support of human rights. Representative surveys in Germany show that the realization of human rights is considered to be very important, but at the same time knowledge of human rights is low and inaccurate. The results show a "halving" of human rights: Some civil rights are known, while economic and social rights are hardly considered human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stellmacher, J., &amp; Sommer, G. (2012). Human rights and human rights violations, psychological aspects of. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology'' (Vol. 2, pp. 514-518). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance in peace psychology are also analyses of whether human rights are used in the sense of peace or whether they are abused for the construction of enemy images or to prepare wars.

== in education ==

Peace psychological findings are used in the content and practice of [[peace education]] at various levels, from primary school to secondary and tertiary education (e.g., in the form of peace psychology courses at universities&lt;ref&gt;[[Citation signal|See]] http://peacepsychology.org/peace-course-syllabi/&lt;/ref&gt;) to vocational training.

The Conflict Information Consortium at the University of Colorado offers the Beyond Intractability project, an openly accessible, cooperative learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.beyondintractability.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

Peace psychology practice refers, for example, to trauma therapeutic work, the implementation of trainings in nonviolent conflict resolution, and activities in such roles as [[Mediation|conflict mediator]] or [[peace worker|civil peace worker]]. Of particular importance is the cooperation between research and practice, such as in the form of [[evaluation research]], to contribute to the continuous improvement of practice.

'''Problem finding''' means problem discovery. It is part of the larger problem process that includes [[problem shaping]] and [[problem solving]]. Problem finding requires intellectual vision and insight into what is missing. This involves the application of [[creativity]].

In [[prospect theory]], the '''pseudocertainty effect''' is the tendency for people to perceive an outcome as certain while it is actually uncertain. It can be observed in multi-stage decision making, in which evaluation of the certainty of the outcome in a previous stage of decisions is disregarded when selecting an option in subsequent stages. Not to be confused with [[certainty effect]], the pseudocertainty effect was discovered from an attempt at providing a normative use of [[decision theory]] for the certainty effect by relaxing the cancellation rule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|date=1981-01-30|title=The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/211/4481/453|journal=Science|language=en|volume=211|issue=4481|pages=453–458|doi=10.1126/science.7455683|issn=0036-8075|pmid=7455683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The pseudocertainty effect was illustrated by [[Daniel Kahneman]], who received the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on decision making and decision theory, in collaboration with [[Amos Tversky]]. The studies that they researched used real and hypothetical monetary gambles and were often used in undergraduate classrooms and laboratories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kahneman and Tversky illustrated the pseudocertainty effect by the following examples.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rizzo|first=James|date=2005-07-01|title=Newcomb's Problem for Decision Theory and Critical Theory|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08935690500122404|journal=Rethinking Marxism|volume=17|issue=3|pages=471–485|doi=10.1080/08935690500122404|issn=0893-5696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem 1 ===
Consider the following two stage game. In the first stage, there is a 75% chance to end the game without winning anything and a 25% chance to move into the second stage. If you reach the second stage, you have a choice between:

Which of the following options do you prefer?

*A. a sure win of $30
*B. 80% chance to win $45

Your choice must be made before the game starts, i.e., before the outcome of the first stage is known. Please indicate the option you prefer.

=== Problem 2 ===
Which of the following options do you prefer?

*C. 25% chance to win $30
*D. 20% chance to win $45

Also, this time the participants had to make their choice before the game starts.

== Significance ==
Each problem was answered by a different group of respondents. In problem 1, people preferred option A with a rate of 74% over option B with 26%. In problem 2, people preferred option D with a rate of 58% over option C with a rate of 42%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the discrepancy between the answers were surprising because the two problems were designed to have identical outcomes. The choices in problem 2 were designed to be compressed forms of the choices from the two stages of problem 1.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Brett K.|last2=Newell|first2=Ben R.|date=2009-09-01|title=Induction with uncertain categories: When do people consider the category alternatives?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/MC.37.6.730|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=730–743|doi=10.3758/MC.37.6.730|issn=0090-502X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(25% chance to move on x 100% = 25%) chance to win $30

(25% chance to move on x 80% = 20%) chance to win $45

Kahneman and Tversky referred to this incidence as a result of what they called the "pseudocertainty effect". They concluded that when people make choices at later stages of problems they often do not realize that uncertainty at an earlier stage will affect the final outcome. This was clearly observed in the two stage problem shown above in which the problem moved onto the second stage only if the condition of the first stage was met.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the second problem, since individuals have no choice on options in the first stage, individuals tend to discard the first option when evaluating the overall probability of winning money, but just to consider the options in the second stage that individuals have a choice on. This is also known as cancellation, meaning that possible options are yielding to the same outcome thus ignoring decision process in that stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[wikt:component|component]]s or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the form of a backup or [[fail-safe]], or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of [[GNSS]] receivers, or [[multi-threaded]] computer processing.

In many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research&lt;/ref&gt; which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; often outweighed by other risk factors, such as [[human error]]. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "majority voting systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303033411/http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |title=Analog Voting Circuit Is More Flexible Than Its Digital Version |author=R. Jayapal |publisher=elecdesign.com |date=2003-12-04 |archivedate=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "voting logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2003/06.html |title=The Aerospace Corporation &amp;#124; Assuring Space Mission Success |publisher=Aero.org |date=2014-05-20 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bridge-suspension.svg|thumb|A [[suspension bridge|suspension bridge's]] numerous cables are a form of redundancy.]]

Redundancy sometimes produces less, instead of greater reliability{{snd}} it creates a more complex system which is prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglect of duty, and may lead to higher production demands which by overstressing the system may make it less safe.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D. Sagan |date=March 2004 |work=Organization &amp; Environment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040714202943/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of redundancy ==
In computer science, there are four major forms of redundancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koren|first1=Israel|last2=Krishna|first2=C. Mani|title=Fault-Tolerant Systems|date=2007|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-12-088525-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are:
* Hardware redundancy, such as [[dual modular redundancy]] and [[triple modular redundancy]]
* Information redundancy, such as [[error detection and correction]] methods
* Time redundancy, performing the same operation multiple times such as multiple executions of a program or multiple copies of data transmitted
* Software redundancy such as [[N-version programming]]

A modified form of software redundancy, applied to hardware may be:

* Distinct functional redundancy, such as both mechanical and hydraulic braking in a car.  Applied in the case of software, code written independently and distinctly different but producing the same results for the same inputs.
[[Structures]] are usually designed with redundant parts as well, ensuring that if one part fails, the entire structure will not collapse. A structure without redundancy is called [[Fracture critical|fracture-critical]], meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure. Bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the [[Silver Bridge]] and the [[Skagit River Bridge|Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River]].

[[File:Series-Parallel-Systems-Examples.jpg|thumb|Series (A) and parallel (B) systems and their combination (C).&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Parallel and combined systems demonstrate different level of redundancy. The models are subject of studies in reliability and safety engineering.

== Function of redundancy ==
The two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and [[active redundancy]]. Both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity.

Passive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges. This extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse. The extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety.

Eyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy. Vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but depth perception is impaired. Hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is impaired. Performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur.

Active redundancy eliminates performance declines by monitoring the performance of individual devices, and this monitoring is used in voting logic. The voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures the components. Error detection and correction and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are two examples of active redundancy.

Electrical power distribution provides an example of active redundancy. Several power lines connect each generation facility with customers. Each power line includes monitors that detect overload. Each power line also includes circuit breakers. The combination of power lines provides excess capacity. Circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload. Power is redistributed across the remaining lines.

==Disadvantages==
[[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004/&gt;

== Voting logic ==
Voting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system. Voting logic often involves computers, but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic. Circuit breakers are an example of a form of non-computer voting logic.

Electrical power systems use [[power scheduling]] to reconfigure active redundancy. Computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost. This prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake.

The simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components: primary and alternate. They both run similar software, but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation. The primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is OK. All outputs from the primary stop, including the activity message, when the primary detects a fault. The alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases. Errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time, or cause outputs to flutter on and off.

A more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more. All perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic. The voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement, and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device(s) that disagree. A single fault will not interrupt normal operation. This technique is used with [[avionics]] systems, such as those responsible for operation of the [[Space Shuttle]].

== Calculating the probability of system failure ==
Each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:-

:&lt;math&gt;{p}=  \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; – number of components
* &lt;math&gt; p_{i} &lt;/math&gt; – probability of component i failing
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; – the probability of all components failing (system failure)

This formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket in such a way that if one power supply failed, the other would too.

It also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98211">'''Self-disclosure''' is a process of communication by which one person reveals information about himself or herself to another.  The information can be descriptive or evaluative, and can include thoughts, feelings, aspirations, goals, failures, successes, fears, and dreams, as well as one's likes, dislikes, and favorites.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ignatius|first=Emmi|author2=Marja Kokkonen |title=Factors contributing to verbal self-disclosure|journal=Nordic Psychology|year=2007|volume=59|issue=4|pages=362–391|doi=10.1027/1901-2276.59.4.362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social penetration theory]] posits that there are two dimensions to self-disclosure: breadth and depth. Both are crucial in developing a fully intimate relationship. The range of topics discussed by two individuals is the breadth of disclosure. The degree to which the information revealed is private or personal is the depth of that disclosure. It is easier for breadth to be expanded first in a relationship because of its more accessible features; it consists of outer layers of personality and everyday lives, such as occupations and preferences. Depth is more difficult to reach, and includes painful memories and more unusual traits that we might hesitate to share with others.  We reveal ourselves most thoroughly and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.&lt;ref name="Tolstedt 1984 84–90"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolstedt|first=Betsy E.|author2=Joseph P. Stokes |title=Self-disclosure, Intimacy, and the Depenetration Process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=46|issue=1|pages=84–90|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.1.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"&gt;Altman, I., &amp; Taylor, D. A. (1973). ''Social penetration: The development of interpersonal relationships.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-disclosure is an important building block for [[intimate relationship|intimacy]] and cannot be achieved without it. Reciprocal and appropriate self-disclosure is expected. Self-disclosure can be assessed by an analysis of cost and rewards which can be further explained by [[social exchange theory]]. Most self-disclosure occurs early in relational development, but more intimate self-disclosure occurs later.

==In intimate relationships==

===Social penetration theory===

[[Social penetration theory]] states that the development of a relationship is closely linked to systematic changes in communication. Relationships generally begin with the exchange of superficial information and gradually move on to more meaningful conversations. In order to develop a more intimate relationship, partners must increase the breadth and depth of their conversations. Breadth includes the variety of topics two people discuss and depth is the personal significance of these topics.&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"/&gt;

Altman and Taylor use a wedge to explain this theory. In this example, the beginning of a relationship is represented by a narrow and shallow wedge because only a few topics are discussed. However, as the relationship goes on, the wedge should become broader and deeper, including more topics of personal significance. The wedge must drive through three "layers" in order for intimacy to develop. The first is superficial "small talk" with little personal information about the speakers. The next layer is intimate, with increasing breadth and depth and more personal details.  The third is the very intimate level, where extremely private information is shared.&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"/&gt;

Intimacy in these relationships can develop only if the persons involved reciprocate disclosures. Intimacy will not develop if only one partner discloses and the other continues to reveal only superficial information. Reciprocity must be gradual and match the intimacy of the other's disclosures.  Too rapid, too personal disclosure creates an imbalance in a relationship that can be discomfiting. This gradual process varies from relationship to relationship and can depend on the specific partner with whom one is communicating.&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"/&gt;

===Reciprocity and intimacy===
[[Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocity]] is a positive response from the person with whom one is sharing information, whereby the person who received the disclosure self-discloses in turn. Self-disclosure usually influences whether two people will want to interact again. Research has shown that when one person self-discloses, another person is more likely to self-disclose. Initially, the process is started by one partner's reveal of personal information to the other partner. In return, the other will disclose something and behave in such a way so as to be responsive to the initial disclosure's content, while also conveying a degree of understanding and validation for what was revealed.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Research has found that people who consider themselves to be high in disclosure are likely to be good at eliciting more disclosure from those with whom they interact.&lt;ref name="Sprecher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprecher|first=Susan|author2=Susan Hendrick |title=Self-Disclosure in Intimate Relationships: Associations With Individual and Relationship Characteristics Over Time|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|year=2004|volume=6|issue=23|pages=857–877|doi=10.1521/jscp.23.6.857.54803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three theories describe reciprocity: The social attraction-trust hypothesis, [[social exchange theory]] and the [[norm of reciprocity]]. The social attraction-trust hypothesis says that people disclose to one another because they believe the person who disclosed to them likes and trusts them. Social exchange theory explains that people attempt to maintain equality in self-disclosure because an imbalance in this makes them uncomfortable. The third explanation, the norm of reciprocity, argues that reciprocating disclosure is a [[social norm]] and violating it makes a person uncomfortable.

There are two types of reciprocity: turn-taking reciprocity and extended reciprocity. Turn-taking is when partners immediately self-disclose with one another and extended is when disclosure happens over a period of time, in which one partner may be the only one disclosing while the other just listens. Those who engage in turn taking reciprocity are shown to like their interaction partners more than those who engage in extended reciprocity. Turn taking partners are also shown to feel closer and similar to each other and to enjoy the other's company more than extended pairs. This can be explained by the social attraction-trust hypothesis because the partners perceive the discloser as liking and trusting them because they disclosed personal information. Those who engage in extended reciprocity are affected by the social exchange theory and the norm of reciprocity which can account for the lower degree of liking. Since extended reciprocity limits reciprocating disclosure it creates an imbalance in disclosure which violates both of these theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|author=Sprecher, S., Treger, S., Wondra, J. D., Hilaire, N., &amp; Wallpe, K.|title=Taking turns: Reciprocal self-disclosure promotes liking in initial interactions.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.03.017|volume=49|pages=860–866}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, people usually report that they themselves are disclosing more than is the other partner. This is called perceived partner reciprocity, and it is critical to the self-disclosure process in developing relationships.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

Two key components for intimacy are disclosure and partner responsiveness.  It is extremely important that when a speaker discloses personal information their partner also discloses something personally relevant. It is also essential that the listener understand, validate and care about what the speaker is disclosing. If the speaker does not feel accepted by the listener then they may not disclose something to them in the future, which stops the development of intimacy. Emotional disclosures are also shown to foster intimacy more than factual disclosures. Factual disclosures reveal facts and information about the self (e.g., "I am divorced from my husband.") while emotional disclosures reveal a person's feelings, thoughts and judgments (e.g., "My divorce was so painful it has made it difficult for me to trust a romantic partner again"). Emotional disclosures can increase intimacy because they allow the listener to confirm and support the discloser's self-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Laurenceau, J., Barrett, L., &amp; Pietromonaco, P. R.|title=Intimacy as an interpersonal process: The importance of self-disclosure, partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness in interpersonal exchanges.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=74|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1238|pmid=9599440|pages=1238–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The transition from sharing impersonal to personal facts is crucial to the building of an intimate relationship. One must feel accepted in order to feel comfortable enough to self-disclose. Without acceptance, one partner will withdraw and fail to reveal personal facts within the relationship. Sharing ourselves also brings us out of our imaginary worlds and allows us to see the realities of the world we live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Matthew|title=The Seven Levels of Intimacy|year=2005|publisher=Fireside Book|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; We are most comfortable sharing with those whom we like and feel like us. There is also evidence that someone who introduces himself with more intimacy is more likely to facilitate self-disclosure and intimacy with the recipient. Thus, self-disclosure breeds intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ignatius|first=E.|author2=M. Kokkonen |title=Factors contributing to verbal self-disclosure|journal=Nordic Psychology|year=2007|volume=4|issue=59|pages=362–391|doi=10.1027/1901-2276.59.4.362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is why we reveal ourselves most and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.&lt;ref name="Tolstedt 1984 84–90"/&gt;

We often perceive our own self-disclosure as higher than our partner's, which can lead to ill feelings. It is hard for humans to accurately judge how fully another is disclosing to them.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

===Individual differences in reciprocity===

====Self-monitoring====

According to Snyder (1974) self-monitoring is the personality difference in individual's degree of preference to both self-expression and self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.R., Mackie, D.M., Claypool, H.M. (2015): Social Psychology (4th Edition). Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Self-monitoring]] is a form of impression management in which a person examines a situation and behaves accordingly. Although self-monitoring is measured on a continuous scale, researchers often group individuals into two types: high and low self-monitors. Someone who is a high self-monitor tends to examine a situation more closely and adjusts their behavior in order "fit in" with others in the scenario. High self-monitors tend to behave in a friendlier and extroverted manner in order to be well liked by peers. A low self-monitor does not do this and tends to follow their own emotions and thoughts when behaving in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Mark|title=The self-monitoring of expressive behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|volume=30|pages=526–537|doi=10.1037/h0037039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since they are more attuned to social cues, high self-monitors are generally better at assessing the level of intimacy a partner is disclosing. By noticing these cues, high self-monitors tend to reciprocate equally in their self-disclosures.&lt;ref name = "self-monitoring"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaffer|first=David R. |author2=Smith, Jonathan E. |author3=Tomarelli, Michele |title=Self-monitoring as a determinant of self-disclosure reciprocity during the acquaintance process.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1982|volume=43|issue=1|pages=163–175|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be explained by the norm of reciprocity because the high self-monitors can pick up on these cues easily and know that they need to respond with their own disclosure. It can also be explained by social exchange theory. Research shows that high self-monitors are more uncomfortable when paired with a low self-monitor because low self-monitors do not tend to disclose intimate details so the balance in the conversation is uneven. High self-monitors are also shown to be the "pace-setters" of the conversation and generally initiate and maintain the flow of a conversation.&lt;ref name="self-monitoring"/&gt;

====Mood====

Those in a positive mood have been found to disclose more intimately than those in a negative mood. This may be because of informational effects whereby happy people tend to access more positive information which leads them to behave in a more optimistic and confident manner. Unhappy people tend to access more negative information which increases the likelihood of cautious, pessimistic and restrained communications.&lt;ref name = "Forgas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|title=Affective influences on self-disclosure: Mood effects on the intimacy and reciprocity of disclosing personal information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=449–461|doi=10.1037/a0021129|pmid=21171788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may also be due to processing effects, in particular assimilation and accommodation effects. Assimilation effects rely on an individual's prior knowledge to guide their behavior in a situation and accommodation effects rely on careful monitoring of a situation and a greater attention to concrete information. Assimilative processing is ideal for safe, routine situations while accommodative processing is for problematic situations. Happy people tend to use assimilative processing, which leads to more daring and direct disclosures, while unhappy people use accommodative processing, which leads them to be more cautious in their disclosures. These accommodating effects for unhappy people tend to increase reciprocity because these individuals will match the level of disclosure from their partner but will not go beyond that.&lt;ref name="Forgas"/&gt;

However, it can also be said that being distressed, anxious, or fearful (which would be classified as negative mood states) can accelerate disclosure as well. The exception to this is [[loneliness]], for lonely individuals have shown decreased rates of self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391" /&gt;

====Gender====

Whether or not one sex shares more readily is a heated debate in social psychology, but sex-role identities play a large part in the amount one chooses to reveal to another. [[Androgynous]] people disclose more intimately across contexts than do notably masculine and feminine people.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391" /&gt;

Research findings on gender differences in self-disclosure are mixed. Women self-disclose to enhance a relationship, while men self-disclose relative to their control and vulnerabilities. Men initially disclose more in heterosexual relationships. Women tend to put more emphasis on intimate communication with same-sex friends than men do.&lt;ref&gt;Farber A. Barry. Self Disclosure in Psychotherapy. The Guilford Press. New York. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In relationships, there are still other factors that contribute to the likelihood of disclosure. While people with high self-esteem tend to reveal themselves more, the reverse is also true, where self-esteem is enhanced by a partner's disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Mark|title=Importance of Self Disclosure in Modern Relationships|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-self-disclosure-modern-relationships-mark-taylor|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In men, self-disclosure and the level of disclosure they perceive from their wives is positively correlated with their [[self-esteem]]. For both genders, the state of a relationship and the feelings associated with it are major contributors to how much each spouse reveals himself or herself. Husbands and wives in a relationship marked with satisfaction, love, and commitment rate their own levels of disclosure highly as well as their perceptions of their spouses' disclosures.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

====Additional individual differences====

Being [[shyness|shy]] decreases self-disclosure. Among men, those who are or appear more "tough" are less likely to disclose and express themselves.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391" /&gt;

[[Motivation]] for disclosure is also critical: does the individual need to present himself or herself in a certain way in order to gain certain benefits, and does the self-disclosure match the person's sense of ideal self? We like to present ourselves in ways that we feel are congruent with our own [[self-concepts]], and what we tell others about ourselves often becomes how we actually are.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391" /&gt;

====Sexual====

Sexual self-disclosure is the act of revealing one's sexual preferences to another, usually to one's sexual partner. This allows an even deeper level of understanding between two people and fosters even more intimacy as a result of the disclosures. Likewise, relationship satisfaction was found to correlate with sexual disclosures. For men, high levels of sexual self-disclosure predicted higher relationship satisfaction, though this was not found to be true for women. But, sexual satisfaction was linked to higher levels of sexual self-disclosure for both men and women. Further, those who disclose more sexually have been found to have less sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rehman | first1 = U. S. | last2 = Rellini | first2 = A. H. | last3 = Fallis | first3 = E. | year = 2011 | title = The importance of sexual self-disclosure to sexual satisfaction and functioning in committed relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 11| pages = 3108–3115 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02439.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In marriage====

Self-disclosure is a method of relationship maintenance, aiming to keep partners satisfied with their relationship. Partners learn a shared communication system, and disclosures are a large part of building that system, which has been found to be very beneficial in highly satisfying relationships.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt; Significant positive relationships have been found between multiple measures of relationship satisfaction and the levels of spouses' disclosure on the Social Penetration Scale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendrick | first1 = S. S. | year = 1981 | title = Self-disclosure and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = 6| pages = 1150–1159 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.40.6.1150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, affection and support are provided to most in the most important ways through marriage. Surveys done by a variety of researchers have found that people list marriage as the ultimate form of intimacy. Spouses feel responsible, in that they need to be responsive to their partners' self-disclosures, more so than they feel obligated to respond to the disclosures of people in their other relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a study by Laurenceau and colleagues, several differences were found in the satisfaction of spouses based on their daily-diary recordings of self-disclosures in their daily interactions. The results show that the actual disclosures in the process of self-disclosure may not be the only factors that facilitate intimacy in relationships. Husbands' intimacy was most strongly predicted by self-disclosure, while perceived responsiveness to disclosure was the stronger predictor for wives' feelings of intimacy with their husbands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A different study found evidence of wives' perceptions of their husbands' self-disclosures as being a strong predictor of how long a couple will stay together. Those who think their husbands are not sharing enough are likely to break up sooner. This finding links to the idea of [[positive illusions]] in relationship studies.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt; For husbands, the actual act of self-disclosure is more indicative of their feelings of intimacy with their wives. On the other hand, wives are thought to value more the feelings of being understood and validated by their husbands' responsiveness to their disclosures, and this is the more important factor in their feelings of intimacy in their marriages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurencaeu|first=Jean-Philippe |author2=Lisa Feldman Barrett |author3=Michael J. Rovine|title=The interpersonal process model of intimacy in marriage: a daily diary and multilevel modeling approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=2|pages=314–323|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Related to these findings, those husbands who reported the highest ratings of global marital satisfaction showed the highest ratings in daily intimacy. Similarly, the wives who rated their global satisfaction highest also had higher levels of daily intimacy. Greater marital satisfaction was found among those who had the higher ratings of intimacy. Further, couples with high levels of demand-withdraw communication rated their average daily intimacy as much lower. This suggests a relationship between one's overall marital satisfaction and the amount of intimacy in a relationship, though no causation can be proven with the present research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Self-esteem has also been found to be a predictor of satisfaction, with couples exhibiting both high self-esteem and high self-disclosure levels being the most satisfied in their relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More disclosures of unpleasant feelings led to less marital satisfaction in recent studies, and disclosure is affected the minute a relationship is stressed, as feelings of less attachment to a spouse promote decreased self-disclosure. Likewise, less intimacy leads to more negative disclosures between partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolstedt|first=B.E.|author2=J.P. Stokes |title=Self-disclosure, intimacy, and the depenetration process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=1|issue=46|pages=84–90|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.1.84}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, findings by Tolstedt and Stokes (1984) suggest that the depth of self-disclosure actually increases as the intimacy of a relationship decreases. The breadth of disclosure decreases with decreasing intimacy as originally predicted, but couples actually disclose more deeply. It is speculated that these results come about because a strained relationship causes spouses to restrict their topics of communication (breadth), but that they are also more willing to discuss deeply intimate subjects: the negative ones. Thus, while they are sharing more deeply, it is mostly in a negative light. The researchers then speculated that people might actually avoid disclosing very personal facts in the most satisfying relationships because they are fearful that their positive relationships will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name="Tolstedt 1984 84–90" /&gt;

As time progresses, disclosure in marriage has been found to decrease, often around the time that spouses reach their 40's. It is suggested that at this stage partners know each other quite well and are very satisfied with what they communicate already.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Process====

People first disclose facts then emotions and disclose mostly positive information in the early stages of a relationship. Some speculate that disclosures and their respective responses from a spouse lead to intimacy between the partners, and these exchanges accumulate into global and positive evaluations of the relationship by the couple. In support, studies show that couples who report greater levels of intimacy in self-reports of their daily interactions are also those who report increased global relationship functioning in their marriages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further, the importance of disclosure in a relationship might change over time as it relates in different ways to various factors of a relationship, such as responsiveness and love, especially at the beginning of a relationship.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

===Effects of group size===

Disclosure also changes as group size increases. As a group gets larger, people become less willing to disclose. Research has shown that individuals are more willing to disclose in groups of two than in larger groups and are more willing to disclose in a group of three rather than four.  The actual disclosures mimic the willingness to disclose as individuals disclose more in pairs than they do in the larger groups. There are also gender differences in disclosure depending on group size. Men feel more inhibited in dyads, match the intimacy of the disclosure from their partner, and do not offer more information. Women, on the other hand, feel more inhibited in larger groups and disclose more personal information in dyads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solano|first=Cecilia|author2=Mina Dunnam |title=Two's Company: Self-Disclosure and Reciprocity in Triads Versus Dyads|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1985|volume=48|issue=2|pages=183–187|doi=10.2307/3033613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In therapy==
Nearly every [[school of thought]] is in agreement that self-disclosure is a necessary element of [[therapeutic]] technique. Self-disclosure by the therapist is often thought to facilitate increased disclosure by the client, which should result in increased understanding of the problem at hand. It helps to acknowledge the therapeutic relationship as a fundamental healing source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziv-Beiman|first=S.|title=Therapist self-disclosure as an integrative intervention|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|year=2013|volume=1|issue=23|pages=59–74|doi=10.1037/a0031783}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alliance between client and therapist is founded on self-disclosure from both parties. In some respects it is similar to modeling appropriate social behavior. Establishing common interests between therapists and clients is useful to maintain a degree of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturges|first=J.W.|title=Use of therapist self-disclosure and self-involving statement|journal=The Behavior Therapist|year=2012|volume=5|issue=35|pages=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing such interests is especially beneficial in therapists' relationships with children, especially teens, who need to understand that the therapist is not an authority in order to fully benefit from therapy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Sturges, J. W. (2012). Use of therapist self-disclosure and self-involving statements. The Behavior Therapist, 35(5), 90-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of self-disclosure in therapy, two types have been identified: immediate and non-immediate. Immediate disclosure shows positive views of the therapeutic process in which the two are engaging and communicates self-involving feelings and information about the therapist's professional background. Many see the benefits of this type of disclosure. Non-immediate disclosure, however, is the revealing of more about the therapist than his or her professional background and includes personal [[insight]]. This type is rather controversial to psychologists in the present day; many feel it may be more detrimental than it is beneficial in the long-run, but there are significant findings that contradict this claim as well.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

Further, there are two methods that therapists use to disclose: direct and indirect. Direct disclosures grant the client information about personal feelings, background, and professional issues. Indirect disclosures are those not explicitly granted, such as pictures on the therapist's desk and walls or wearing his or her wedding band.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paine | first1 = A.

===Therapists' reasons to share information===

Studies have asked therapists to report their reasons to disclose to clients. The most common reasons are: to answer a direct question from the client, to help soothe the client's feelings of loneliness, to express understanding, to lower a client's anxiety levels and make his or her feelings seem more normal, and to build rapport.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The topics discussed by therapists who self-disclose in their sessions can vary. The preferred therapeutic approach and the effectiveness of treatments are two of the most common. Many also reveal their views of raising children, stress-coping methods, items that convey respect for the client, and emotions that will validate those the client has expressed. Anecdotes about sexual attraction, dreams, and personal problems seem to be disclosed to subjects with the least frequency by therapists.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

===History===

The history of therapist disclosure has been a journey based largely on the therapists' perspectives. Early [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]] theorists strongly disagreed with the incorporation of therapist self-disclosure in the client-therapist relationship. Ferenczi notably maintained his belief that self-disclosure was of the utmost importance in children's therapy for traumas in that a neutral, flat therapist would only cause the child to relive the trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Ferenczi, S., &amp; Rank, O. (1986). The development of psychoanalysis. Classics In Psychoanalysis Monograph Series, MO 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory|Object-relation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s theorists want the client to be able to see how he or she is seen by another and how what she shares is viewed by another, and the best way to operationalize these factors is through a trusting relationship with a therapist who also discloses. [[Self psychology|Self-theorists]] believe much the same as object-relations theorists. [[Intersubjective psychoanalysis|Intersubjective]] and [[Relational psychodynamics|relational]] schools of thought encourage disclosure due to its ability to bring subjectivity into therapy, which they deem a necessary element to real healing. They maintain that therapeutic relationships cannot be initiated and changed without intentional disclosures from both therapist and client.&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziv-Beiman|first=Sharon|title=Therapist self-disclosure as an integrative intervention|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|year=2013|volume=23|issue=1|pages=59–74|doi=10.1037/a0031783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary views, most agree with the inevitability of self-disclosure in therapy. [[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic]] theorists want to trigger personal growth in clients and feel that a strong relationship with a therapist is a good facilitator of such, so long as the therapist's disclosures are genuine. Seeing that weakness and struggle are common among all people, even therapists, is useful to clients in the humanistic therapy setting. In order for [[Existential therapy|existential]] psychologists to help clients, they try to disclose their own coping methods to serve as sources of inspiration to find one's own answers to questions of life. For therapists who value [[feminism]], it is important to disclose personal feelings so that their clients have total freedom to choose the correct therapist and to eliminate power fights within the therapeutic setting. The ever-popular [[Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy|cognitive-behavioral]] approach also encourages disclosure in therapy so that clients can normalize their own thoughts with someone else's, have their thoughts challenged, and reinforce positive expectations and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

Humanistic theorists have been the highest in rating self-disclosure as part of their normal therapeutic methods. Clearly, today's therapists are mostly supportive of disclosure in therapy, as the early psychoanalytic [[taboo]] of such is slowly being overridden through the recognition of many schools of thought. Most identify the benefit of self-disclosures in facilitating rewarding relationships and helping to reach therapeutic goals.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

===Benefits===

It is useful to discuss personal matters in therapy for a variety of reasons. Certain types of disclosures are almost universally recognized as necessary in the early stages of therapy, such as an explanation of the therapeutic approach to be used and particular characteristics of the therapist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disclosure with another individual facilitates a closeness in that relationship and is strongly believed to lead to a deeper understanding of the self.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt; One will often see his or her disclosure in a more positive [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] if it is shared with someone else. It is thought that disclosing the details of a traumatic experience can greatly help with the organization of related thoughts, and the process of retelling is itself a method of healing. An understanding between therapist and client is achieved when the client can share his or her perceptions without feeling threatened by judgments or unwanted advice. Further, expressing emotions lessens the toll of the [[autonomic nervous system]] and has been shown in several studies to improve overall physical health in this way.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391"/&gt; A disclosing therapist invites his or her client to compare cognitive perceptions and perhaps realize his or her own distortions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The disclosure need not be verbal to be advantageous, as writing about traumas and positive experiences alike has been seen to produce less psychological and physiological distress. The [[Writing therapy|Pennebaker Writing Disclosure Paradigm]] is a method commonly used in therapy settings to facilitate writing about one's experiences. [[Exposure therapy|Exposure theory]] also offers support in that reliving and talking about a negative event should help the [[negative affect]] to be more accepted by the individual overtime through [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391"/&gt;

A study by Watkins (1990) formulated four model hypotheses for the use of self-disclosure in therapy sessions. Supported heavily is the idea of mutuality: disclosure by one leads to disclosure by the other. The modeling hypothesis suggests that the client will model the disclosures of the therapist, thereby learning expression and gaining skills in communication. Some argue for the reinforcement model, saying that the use of self-disclosure by therapists is purely to reinforce self-disclosure in their clients. Lastly, the social exchange hypothesis sees the relationship between client and therapist as an interaction that requires a guide: self-disclosure.&lt;ref name=Ziv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, C. E. ( 1990). The effects of counselor self-disclosure: A research review. The Counseling Psychologist, 18, 477– 500. {{DOI|10.1177/0011000090183009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clients' self-reported improvement when a therapist has used disclosure in therapy is high.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Regardless, the benefits of validating the client's thoughts through self-disclosure has been shown to be largely beneficial in the scope of therapy.

Studies have also shown the disadvantageous effects of keeping [[Secrecy|secrets]], for they serve as [[stressors]] over time. Concealing one's thoughts, actions, or ailments does not allow a therapist to examine and work through the client's problem. Unwanted, recurrent thoughts, feelings of anxiousness and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], sleeping problems, and many other physiological, psychological, and physical issues have been seen as the results of withholding important information from others.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391"/&gt;

The treatment of clients with [[adjustment disorders]], [[anxiety disorders]], [[mood disorders]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] have been thought to use self-disclosure techniques the most. Therapy sessions for [[personality disorders]], [[Behavioral disorder|behavior disorders]], [[impulse control disorders]], and [[psychotic disorders]] seem to use therapist self-disclosure far less often.&lt;ref name=Ziv /&gt;

===Effects on the client's view of the therapist===

Therapists who self-disclose, especially information that validates or reflects the information disclosed by the client, have been rated in studies consistently as demonstrating more warmth and being more personable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study using participants who were to imagine themselves in hypothetical counseling situations found that therapists who responded to "What would you do if you were me?" when asked by the client, were viewed as more socially attractive, more expert, and more trustworthy. Their likability was increased by their willingness to disclose to their clients. The three dimensions mentioned have been said to be of utmost importance when determining one's likability.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, these therapists may also been seen as less professional for these disclosures. Additionally, a therapist who discloses too frequently risks losing focus in the session, talking too much about himself or herself and not allowing the client to actually harvest the benefits of the disclosures in the session through client-focused reflection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ziv /&gt; Much research has found that successful therapy treatments are enhanced when the client has a largely favorable view of the therapist.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Environmental contributions to client disclosures===

The atmosphere in which the therapy takes place is crucial too. Research shows that "soft" architecture and decor in a room promotes disclosure from clients. This is achieved with rugs, framed photos, and mellow lighting. It is thought that this environment more closely imitates the setting in which friends would share feelings, and so the same might be facilitated between counselor and client. Further, a room should not be too crowded nor too small in order to foster good disclosures from the client&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362–391" /&gt;

===Effectiveness===
The efficacy of self-disclosure is widely debated by researchers, and findings have yielded a variety of results, both positive and negative. A typical method of researching such ideas involves [[Self-report study|self-reports]] of both therapists and clients. The evaluations of therapists on the positive effects of their own disclosures is far less positive than that of clients' self-reports. Clients are especially likely to assert that the disclosures of their therapists help in their recovery if the disclosures are perceived as more intimate in content.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Clients report that disclosures are helpful when they encourage a positive relationship with the therapist, build trust in their therapists' abilities and general person, create a feeling of being better-understood, and make the therapist seem more human. Much of these results, however, are linked to how skilled the therapist is in disclosing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Risks===

Any information revealed that could reverse the effects of therapy or switch the roles of therapist and client is thought to be the most detrimental. Therapists must choose wisely in what they disclose and when. A client who is suffering greatly or facing a horrific crisis is not likely to benefit much from therapist self-disclosures. If a client at any point feels he or she, should be acting as a source of support to the therapist, disclosure is only hindering the healing process. Further, clients might become overwhelmed if their initial ideas of therapy do not include any degree of self-disclosure from their counselor, and this will not lead to successful therapy sessions either. It is also a risk to reveal too much about a therapist because the client may begin to see the healer as flawed and untrustworthy. Clients should not feel like they are in competition for time to speak and express themselves during therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite contradictory findings, self-disclosure is still used frequently in therapy and is often recommended. The [[American Psychological Association]] supports the technique, calling it "promising and probably effective".&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt; Therapists are advised, however, to use self-disclosure with a mild frequency, to disclose more immediate-disclosure information, to keep intimacy at a minimum, and to keep the focus on the client promptly after disclosure to ensure optimum effectiveness in therapy sessions.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt; Therapist self-disclosure in a counseling setting is ethical so long as the client is not harmed or exploited.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Self-involving statements===

Therapists who use self-involving statements are likely to facilitate valuable self-disclosures from their clients. Using [[I-statements|"I" statements]], a therapist emits a certain level of care not otherwise felt by many clients, and they are likely to benefit from this feeling of being cared for. In cases of a therapist needing to provide feedback, self-involving statements are nearly inevitable, for he or she must state a true opinion of what the client has disclosed. These sorts of "I" statements, when used correctly and professionally, are usually seen as especially validating by clients. Largely, the use of self-involving statements by therapists is seen as a way of making the interaction more authentic for the client, and such exchanges can have a great impact on the success of the treatment at hand.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Marital therapy ===
Couples-therapy is often centered on creating more intimacy in a relationship. Spouses are encouraged, or even required, to disclose unexpressed emotions and feelings to their partners. The partners' responses are practiced to be nonjudgmental and accepting. Therapists utilize techniques like rehearsal and the teaching of listening skills. Some fear that this is of little long-term help to the couple because in their real lives, there is no mediator or guiding therapist's hand when one is disclosing to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurenceau|first=Jean-Philippe |author2=Lise Feldman Barret |author3=Michael J. Rovine|title=The interpersonal process model of intimacy in marriage: a daily-diary and multilevel modeling approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=2|pages=314–323|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that self-disclosure is related to husband's ratings of marital satisfaction, teaching proper ways for a couple to disclose to one another might be a very beneficial skill therapists can use both for prevention and treatment in therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==During childhood==
While striving to become more like adults, looking for greater independence, and learning to become more self-reliant, children are also trying to facilitate relationships of equality with their parents. Goals like these, as reported by young people fairly universally, can affect how they disclose to their parents to a large degree.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Children's disclosures with their parents has been studied by many, especially recently, after the discoveries of disclosures' positive relationships with children's adjustment levels and psychological and physical health. Some go so far as to use the rate of self-disclosure between parents and children as a dominant measure of the strength of their relationship and its health.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = S. B. | last2 = Barber | first2 = B. K. | last3 = Olsen | first3 = J. A. | last4 = McNeely | first4 = C. A. | last5 = Bose | first5 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Adolescents' self-disclosure to parents across cultures: Who discloses and why | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 447–478 | doi = 10.1177/0743558411402334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose of disclosure===

In [[adolescents]]' relationships with their parents, self-disclosure is thought to serve three key functions: 
#  [[Intimacy]] is promoted. When information is withheld, distance is created and closeness is nearly impossible to facilitate.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; 
#  [[Autonomy]] is regulated. Teens pick and choose what to tell their parents, thus limiting their control over the teens' daily activities.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
#  [[Individuation]] is heightened. Adolescents' unique preferences and interests are expressed. If these vary from their parents', they establish an identity of their own.&lt;ref name="tokic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokic|first=Ana|author2=Ninoslava Pecnik |title=Parental behaviors related to adolescents' self-disclosure: adolescents' views|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=2010|volume=2|issue=28|pages=201–220|doi=10.1177/0265407510382320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Children still attempt to maintain a certain amount of control over their parents' knowledge of their lives by monitoring how and when to disclose to them. Thus, they moderate their parents' potential reactions. Because of this, it is important for parents to be aware of how they react to their children's disclosures, for these reactions will be used as judgment calls for the children's' future sharing.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Reasons for===

Often, the reason for disclosing given by children in studies is  based on the parent's expectations: "I've learned that [Mom or Dad] wants to have this information." This is adaptive, in that the child has learned what his or her parents want to know. Other times a reason is that the children do not want their parents to worry about them, and this is called parent-centered disclosures. Disclosing in order to make oneself feel better or to ensure protection from parents is considered to be another reason for youth to disclose, and it is called self-oriented disclosure. On a more manipulative level, some adolescents report telling their parents things based solely on gaining an advantage of some sort, whether this is the right to reveal less or the fact that being more open tends to result in more adolescent privileges. Sometimes children qualify their disclosures by merely stating that they only disclose what they feel they want to their parents. Thus, some information is kept secret. This is dubbed selective self-disclosure. In sum, adolescents feel different pulls that make them self-disclose to their parents that can be based on the parents' needs and the children's needs. There has not been a distinct pattern found to predict which reasons will be utilized to explain disclosures by different children. For this reason it is widely believed that the reason for disclosure is largely situation- and context- dependent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Benefits===

The self-disclosure of children to their parents is the dominant source of information for parents to gain knowledge about their children and their daily lives. Parental knowledge of their children's whereabouts and daily lives has been linked to several positive outcomes. The more parents know about their kids, the lower the rate of behavior problems among children, and the higher the children's [[well-being]]. Adolescents who disclose have been found to have lower rates of [[substance abuse]], lower rates of risky sexual behaviors, lower anxiety levels, and lower rates of depression.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urry | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = L. J. | last3 = Padilla-Walker | first3 = L. M. | year = 2011 | title = Mother knows best: Psychological control, child disclosure, and maternal knowledge in emerging adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Family Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 157–173 | doi = 10.5172/jfs.2011.17.2.157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Additionally, those who are well-adjusted, meaning they exhibit the qualities discussed above, generally want and enjoy parental involvement and are likely to disclose more.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; In contrast, keeping secrets from one's parents has been linked to more [[physical illness]], poor behavior, and depression in all cultural groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many theorize that in at least one significant relationship one should feel able to disclose nearly completely in order for a healthy personality to develop.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; While parental behavioral control was once thought to provide the greatest benefits to children in limiting their activities and serving as a source of forced protection, more recent research strongly suggests that disclosures to parents that provide the parents with information about daily activities actually shows the most promise in fostering positive development through childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Development of reciprocity===

Reciprocity in children's self-disclosures is often examined in children's friendships. It has been shown that children's understanding of friendship involves sharing secrets with another person. This mutual exchange of sharing secrets could be the norm of reciprocity, in which individuals disclose because it is a social norm. This [[norm of reciprocity]] is shown to begin occurring for children in sixth grade. Sixth graders are able to understand the norm of reciprocity because they realize that relationships require both partners to cooperate and to mutually exchange secrets. They realize this because they possess the cognitive ability to take another person's perspective into account and are able to understand a third person's views which allows them to view friendships as an ongoing systematic relationship.&lt;ref name = "Rotenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotenberg|first=Ken|author2=Nancy Chase |title=Development of the reciprocity of self-disclosure.|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|year=1992|volume=153|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1080/00221325.1992.10753703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in sixth grade are also shown to understand equivalent reciprocity. Equivalent reciprocity requires matching the level of intimacy a partner discloses, therefore, a high-intimacy disclosure would be matched with an equally revealing disclosure while a low-intimacy disclosure would be matched with little information revealed. Another type of reciprocity is covariant reciprocity, in which disclosures are more intimate if a partner communicates a high-intimacy disclosure instead of a low-intimacy disclosure. This differs from equivalent reciprocity, which matches the level of intimacy, while covariant reciprocity only focuses on whether someone disclosed something personal or not. Covariant reciprocity is shown to begin in fourth grade.&lt;ref name="Rotenberg" /&gt;

It has also been shown that girls across all ages disclose more intimate information than boys, and that the number of disclosures a child reveals increases with age.&lt;ref name="Rotenberg" /&gt;

===Influencing factors===
Early studies note two distinct factors that contribute to how much children self-disclose to their parents. The first is intraindividual factors, which are those that are on the child's mind and cause him or her to need social input. Biological development, cultural and social pressures, and individual [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] determine these issues, and, thus, a child's age, personality, and background also contribute to his or her level and need of self-disclose in a relationship with a parent.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

The second set of factors is called contextual factors, which include the opportunities and situations that the individual has to disclose as created by the [[Sociocultural perspective|sociocultural]] environment. These are most directly related, then, to the target of the disclosure; these targets are the parents.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

Also, gender contributes: girls are noted for usually disclosing their problems, mostly to their mothers, while boys reveal more about bad grades, behavioral conflicts, and other issues to both parents.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

Certain people are more likely to get others to disclose. These are called high openers. Even people known to disclose very little are likely to disclose more to high openers. Thus, if parents are characterized as good listeners, trustworthy, accepting, relaxed, and sympathetic, as are high openers, then they will likely elicit more disclosure from their children. Adolescents who view their parents like this are also said to see them as less controlling and less likely to react negatively to their disclosures. Parental responsiveness has been said to be the dominant factor of influence on adolescents' rates of self-disclosure; warmth and affection facilitate more disclosures.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Parental psychological control has also been linked to increased self-disclosure of personal issues and peer issues among youth. While this sort of control is not often thought of in a positive light, some hypothesize that these kids are likely just feeling coerced to disclose subtly and without being harmed. Much of what children choose to reveal to their parents is based on previous disclosures and their parents' reactions to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Feelings about the parent-child relationship during one's upbringing have also be found to correlate with the child's disclosures to the parents. A child with a positive memory of his or her relationship with a parent during the past years is a predictor of a higher level of self-disclosure. In fact, the view of the parent-child relationship in the past is a stronger predictor than that of the child's view of the current parent-child relationship. The relationship with the mother, in particular, is extremely predictive of disclosures from adolescents. Such findings suggest to parents that fostering [[secure attachment]] early in their children will better set the stage for disclosures in the later years, and their children may then reap the benefits of such a relationship.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Adolescents are able to determine their own amount of parental authority over certain issues by how much or how little they choose to disclose to their parents.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Surveys revealed that they are least likely to share information that involves their personal feelings and activities. They actively resist disclosing this to their parents because they do not see the issues as being harmful, or they feel their parents will not listen to them, or because the matters are very private to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The way adolescents perceive their parents' authority as legitimate largely impacts how much they feel obligated to disclose to them. The more authority the children believe their parents rightly possess, the more [[obligation]] they perceive to share their lives accordingly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parents who attempt a large degree of psychological control over their children are unlikely to be disclosed to as frequently, which only makes logical sense given the fact that most children are searching for a sense of autonomy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The adolescents have been found to feel the most obligation to tell their parents about such activities as drinking and smoking but less need to disclose information about personal issues. Not surprising either, less obligation is felt as age increases.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Contrary to popular belief though, most adolescents in the US do not consider themselves to be adults between the ages of 18 and 27, and their parents feel the same way. The age at which children feel they no longer are obligated to disclose to their parents has increased over time, and the same trend is predicted over the next few decades.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Often, the motivation to disclose negative behaviors is purely because the children fear that they will not get away with it or feel obligated to share. Adolescents also want to disclose more if they feel that the activities in question are out of their own jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is measured, in the adolescents' minds, as how short-term and close the activities are. Short-term, close activities are judged as ones to be handled without disclosure to parents, while activities that will take longer or require the adolescent to be farther from home are thought of as being issues to discuss with parents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Inhibitors===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make disclosures unlikely:&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Mood: Nervous, angry, or unhappy parents make children less likely to disclose&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Preoccupied: Parents who do not seem accessible to their children do not receive good disclosures&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reluctance: When parents seem unwilling to talk about problems or consistently avoid certain topics of conversation&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Questioning: Adolescents are bothered by persistent questions that their parents ask of them&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Respect: Children do not disclose as much if they feel their parents are not taking them seriously&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Nagging: When parents seem to hag on unimportant matters, children become frustrated&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Previous disapproval: Adolescents are not likely to disclose if their parents have previously expressed disapproval of a matter they wish to discuss&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Factors that discourage future disclosures===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make the child less willing to disclose to that parent in the future:
*Distraction: If parents seem inattentive, the child is not likely to try to disclose in the future&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Respect: Parents who make jokes about disclosures or tease their children discourage future discussions&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Lack of trust: Children are not likely to disclose again when parents have shown doubt about their previous disclosures or checked the information that had been revealed&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Interrupting: Parents who interrupt their children do not encourage future disclosure&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Lack of relatability: Children will not disclose again if they feel their parents did not try to understand their position in previous disclosures&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Lack of receptivity: Parents who seem not to care about the child's thoughts on matters and who will not listen to arguments discourage future disclosure&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Confidentiality: Children feel less inclined to disclose in the future if their parents do not keep their disclosures confidential&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Emotion: Parents who have angry outbursts do not encourage further disclosures from their children&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Consequences: Disclosures that resulted in punishment serve has discouragement for future disclosures. Additionally, long lectures from parents are not viewed as favorable&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Disappointment: When disclosure has made a parent disappointed or sad in his or her child, the child feels less inclined to disclose again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Silence: Parents who respond to a disclosure with the [[silent treatment]] are unlikely to facilitate later disclosures&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Withholding permission: If earlier disclosure resulted in parents withholding permissions for children to participate in their desired activities, the children often do not disclose such information again later&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Facilitators===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make disclosures likely:
*Mood: Positive moods (happy and relaxed) in parents make adolescents likely to begin to disclose&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Accessibility: When parents seem ready and able to chat without doing other things, children want to disclose to them&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Opportunities: Parents who make time for the child, initiate conversations, and prompt disclosures (perhaps with humor) usually facilitate disclosures from their children&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reciprocal disclosure: Children are encouraged if their parents choose to reveal things about themselves&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Questions: Open-ended questions give adolescents motivation to disclose&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Attention to child's mood: When parents recognize the affective state of a child, the child feels cared for and is likely to be open to discussing the causes of that mood&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Unconditional disclosure: Children feel encouraged to disclose when parents make a point of telling the child to reveal himself or herself no matter what&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Pace: Letting children choose how and how fast they disclose makes them more likely to reveal things to their parents&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Factors that encourage future disclosures===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make the child more likely to disclose to that parent in the future:
*Support: Previous disclosures that have made the child feel emotionally supported positively affect whether or not he or she will disclose to a parent again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Humor: Parents who can appreciate humor in disclosure, where appropriate, encourage the child to disclose again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reciprocity: Parental disclosure makes a child more likely to disclose to that parent again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Understanding/empathy: A parent who makes an obvious attempt to understand the child's position makes the child more willing to share in the future.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Attention: Children will likely disclose again when they believe their parents are giving them their full attention without interruption&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Appreciations: Parents who express to their adolescents that they value their disclosures encourage such to happen again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Respect: Children want to disclose again if they feel their parents take them seriously&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Confidence in the child: Parents who express their trust in the child's ability to handle his or her problems will likely be disclosed to in the future&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Trustworthiness: Adolescents will want to reveal information to their parents again if they trust that the disclosure will be confidential&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Advice: If parents offer good advice and help for a youth's problems, he or she is prompted to discuss things with the parent later on&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reactions: Parents will often be told information from their children again if they keep their reactions to disclosures calm&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Discussion: Children prefer to talk about their issues, so if adults are willing, children will likely open up to them often&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Receptivity: Adults who consider arguments from the child and "hear him or her out" encourage these children to reveal their thoughts again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Results: If permissions for adolescents' wishes have been granted after disclosing in the past, the child is more likely to disclose in the future&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

==On the Internet==

There are four major differences between online communication and face to face communication. The first is that [[Internet]] users can remain anonymous. The user can choose what personal information (if any) they share with other users. Even if the user decides to use their own name, if communicating with people in others cities or countries they are still relatively anonymous. The second is that physical distance does not limit interaction on the Internet the way it does in real life. The Internet gives the ability to interact with people all over the world and the chance to meet people who have similar interests that one may not have met in their offline life.  Visual cues, including those pertaining to physical attractiveness, are also not always present on the Internet. These factors have been shown to influence initial attraction and relationship formation. Finally, Internet users have time to formulate conversations which is not allotted in face to face conversation. This gives a user more control in the conversation because they do not have to give an immediate response.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Katelyn Y. A.|last1=McKenna|first2=John A.|last2=Bargh|title=Plan 9 From Cyberspace: The Implications of the Internet for Personality and Social Psychology|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=57–75|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0401_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of online interaction affecting disclosure===

====Anonymity====

[[Anonymity]] can allow individuals to take greater risks and discuss how they truly feel with others. A person might take these risks because they are more aware of their private self. Private self-awareness is when a person becomes more aware of personal features of the self. This is in contrast to public self-awareness in which a person realizes that they can be judged by others. This type of awareness can lead to evaluation apprehension, where a person fears receiving a negative evaluation from their peers. Public self-awareness is also associated with conforming to group norms even if they go against personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crisp|first1=R.J.|last2=Turner|first2=R.N.|title=Essential Social Psychology|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|isbn=1849203865|pages=2–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that said, the absence of visual cues from a partner in Internet discussion can activate a person's private self which encourages self-disclosure. This is because the discloser is not worried about being judged publicly and is able to express their own private thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joinson|first=Adam|title=Self-disclosure in computer-mediated communication: The role of self-awareness and visual anonymity.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=177–192|doi=10.1002/ejsp.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymity also aids in identity construction. A person can change their gender and the way they relate to others due to anonymity. This can increase life satisfaction because those who can identify with multiple roles are shown to be more satisfied. Since the Internet can allow someone to adopt these roles, that close others may not accept in the real world, it can increase their self-worth and acceptance.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;
 
The anonymity that comes with Internet communication also makes it easier to reveal the "[[true self]]". The "true self", as described by McKenna and her colleagues includes the traits a person possesses but is unable to share freely with others. What they do share is the "actual self" which includes traits they do possess and are able to be shown in social settings. The actual self can be easier to present in face to face conversations because a person's true self may not fit societal norms. Disclosing one's "true self" has been shown to create empathetic bonds and aid in forming close relationships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bargh|first1=John A.|last2=McKenna|first2=Katelyn Y.A.|last3=Fitzsimons|first3=Grainne M.|title=Can You See the Real Me? Activation and Expression of the "True Self" on the Internet|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2002|volume=58|issue=1|pages=33–48|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymity can also help stigmatized groups reveal their "true selves" and allow them to come together to discuss aspects of the self that cannot be discussed in one's social circle. This can help them in life because it allows them to form a group of similar others and the opportunity to receive emotional support. It has also been found that those who join these groups and disclose their identity were more likely to share this aspect of the self with their close family and friends. Sharing these long kept secrets has also shown to significantly reduce health symptoms over a length of time.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

There are some negative consequences to being anonymous on the Internet. [[Deindividuation]], where self-awareness is blocked by environmental conditions, can occur and be problematic. Some consequences of deindividuation include the reduced ability to control one's behavior and engage in rational, long-term planning, and the tendency to react immediately and emotionally. A person who is lacking this self-awareness is also less likely to care about other's opinions of his or her behavior. This all can lead to increased hostility towards others and the formation of anonymous hate groups.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

There can also be some negative consequences to forming multiple selves. If these identities are not integrated it can lead to an incomplete sense of self. They could also be brought into the real world and lead to delusional and unrealistic behavior.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;
 
One downside to all of the connections that can be formed online regards the effect called the "illusion of large numbers." This effect means that people overestimate how many people share the same opinion as them. This can be especially harmful if someone holds negative views of a particular group because they may not realize that their views are very different from the mainstream.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

====Lack of visual cues and physical attractiveness====

Physical attractiveness plays an important role in determining if two people will begin a relationship. In face to face conversation, if initial attraction is not present, the relationship is less likely to form. This, however, does not play a role in Internet communication. Relationships online must form based on things such as similarities, values, interests or an engaging conversation style. Since these relationships form at a deeper level they may be more durable and more important to the individual. Not being seen also assists in presenting ideal qualities (attributes an individual would ideally like to possess)  to other users because there is no information to contradict what they say, the way there is in face to face conversation. This can help a person make these ideal qualities a [[social reality]] because when someone confirms these traits the individual can make them a part of their self-concept.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

An individual is also liked more on the Internet than in face to face conversation. Even if partners think they are communicating with two different people they still like the person from the Internet more than the face to face interaction, even though they were the same person. This greater liking also continues after the initial interaction on the Internet when the pair meets face to face. This greater liking may occur because of the lack of physical information. Physical attractiveness plays an important role in impression formation and once these views are formed they are not likely to be changed even when presented with new information. Since the people communicating online cannot rely on attractiveness these factors may not play a role when they eventually meet face to face. An increase in disclosures can also foster this liking because intimate disclosure is associated with increased intimacy.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt; Online disclosures are generally seen as more intimate than face to face disclosures. Since there is a lack of nonverbal cues in Internet communication, many people form a biased perception of their communication partner. The minimal cues that are available in computer based communication are often over interpreted and the person will attach greater value to them. For example, if there seems to be a similarity between the two communicating, an individual may intensify this perception and idealize their partner. This all then increases the perceived intimacy of the discloser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=L.C.|last2=Bazarova|first2=N.N.|last3=Hancock|first3=J.T.|title=From Perception to Behavior: Disclosure Reciprocity and the Intensification of Intimacy in Computer-Mediated Communication|journal=Communication Research|year=2013|volume=40|issue=1|pages=125–143|doi=10.1177/0093650211405313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical distance and familiarity====

People are more likely to form relationships with those who are in close physical proximity of them. Individuals are also more likely to begin an interaction with someone who is seen on a regular basis, showing that familiarity also influences interactions. Communicating on the Internet can allow individuals to become familiar with those who frequent the pages they converse on by recognizing usernames and pages. Regardless of how far away these individuals may be from each other, they are all in one confined space on the Internet which can give the feeling of being in the same place. The Internet also brings people together that may not have met because of physical distance. They can also go to specific websites where people share the same interests so they enter conversations knowing they already have similarities. This can contribute to why Internet relationships form so quickly. These online users do not have to go through the traditional stages that face to face interactions require in order to find similar interests. These face to face interactions usually take longer to find common ground but online users are able to dive right into conversations.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

====Pace and control of conversation====

Internet communication differs significantly from face-to-face conversation in the timing and pacing of a conversation. For example, both users do not need to be online at the same time to have a conversation. E-mail, for example, allows individuals to send messages and wait for a reply that may not come for hours or even days. This can allow many people to stay in touch, even if they are in different time zones, which significantly broadens the range of communication.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

This communication also allows an individual to take their time when speaking with someone. They do not have to have an immediate response that face-to-face conversation requires. This allows them to carefully select and edit their messages and gives them more control over their side of the conversation that they would not have outside of the Internet. There are also no interruptions in online communication that occur in face-to-face conversation. A person is able to "hold the floor" and say as little or as much as they would like in these communications, allowing them to fully form their point.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

This control helps users to take greater risks with their self-disclosures online. These people also begin to incorporate their Internet lives with their non-Internet lives and engage in a presence–control exchange. In this exchange, Internet users start their relationships with relatively high control and gradually trade that for physical closeness as their comfort levels and knowledge of the other person increases. This seems to be the Internet version of [[social penetration theory]], where individuals have a mutual exchange of self-disclosures. As the relationship develops in face-to-face communication the individuals' disclosures gradually become more revealing and cover a wide range of topics. This equivalent on the Internet includes the partners exchanging control of the conversation for physical closeness. The stages this occurs in could include moving from messaging online, to telephone conversations and eventually face-to-face communication.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

===Individual differences===

====Self-esteem====

The use of social media for self-disclosure has shown to be very helpful for those with low [[self-esteem]]. People with low self-esteem are more socially anxious and shy which can make it difficult to form close relationships with others. This can harm both their physical and mental health because feeling connected to others is considered a fundamental human motivation.  Individuals with low self-esteem have difficulty disclosing to others because they are very focused on not revealing their flaws and fear criticism and disapproval from others. Disclosing less, therefore, protects them from the possibility of rejection or being ignored. 
In light of these fears, social media can provide a safe environment for people with low self-esteem to disclose personal information because they cannot see their partner's reactions which can help them to more freely express themselves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forest|first1=Amanda L.|last2=Wood|first2=Joanne V.|title=When Social Networking is Not Working: Individuals with Low Self-Esteem Recognize but do not Reap the Benefits of Self-Disclosure on Facebook|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=23|issue=3|pages=298–302|doi=10.1177/0956797611429709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many with low self-esteem do view social media as a safe outlet for disclosure, many do not receive positive feedback for their disclosures. People with low self-esteem tend to post more negative thoughts on social media which has been shown to make them less liked by readers. Negative posts are also more likely to be ignored by readers in hopes that the discloser will stop and begin to post more positively. When someone who frequently shares negative thoughts posts something positive they do receive more positive feedback from readers. In contrast, someone with high self-esteem is more liked by readers and tends to post more positively. If they do post something negative they tend to get more responses than those with low self-esteem do.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Loneliness====

Social media can also help those who are [[loneliness|lonely]]. Many social networking sites give access to profiles, pictures and the ability to comment and message others which helps people to feel less lonely. It also aids them in gaining social capital like emotional satisfaction and access to information. These sites can facilitate disclosure because they make it easier to access others who can provide social support for someone to disclose personal information. Social support is extremely important in disclosure as it makes the discloser feel validated and cared for. Social support is also positively related to well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=K.|last2=Noh|first2=M.|last3=Koo|first3=D.|title=Lonely people are no longer lonely on social networking sites: The mediating role of self-disclosure and social support.|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|year=2013|volume=16|issue=6|pages=413–418|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0553}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that having this social support and forming close relationships online decreases loneliness overtime.&lt;ref name= "McKennaGreenGleason2002"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Katelyn Y. A.|last1=McKenna|first2=Amie S.|last2=Green|first3=Marci E.J.|last3=Gleason|title=Relationship Formation on the Internet: What's the Big Attraction?|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2002|volume=58|pages=9–31|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research does show that spending too  much time on the Internet and forming these close relationships could take away time from existing non-Internet relationships. Neglecting these relationships could make a person lonelier in the long run because they could lose these face to face relationships.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

However, other research shows that there are certain personality traits that lead to increased loneliness which then leads to increased use of the Internet. In particular, extroversion and neuroticism have been linked to loneliness. An extrovert is someone who is outgoing, enjoys the company of others, requires stimulation, and is spontaneous, while an introvert prefers his or her own company, is quiet, and prefers quiet, small gatherings. Introverts can often be seen as distant and unfriendly because of this behavior which may explain some of their loneliness. A neurotic person is extremely anxious, emotional and reacts in a disproportional way to many situations. Someone high in neuroticism generally has a negative attitude which may push people away and prevent them from forming close relationships which may lead to their loneliness.  Both of these groups (introverts and neurotics) have been shown to have increased Internet use and in particular increased use of social service sites (i.e. chatrooms, newsrooms, etc.). This may show that those who are already lonely are more attracted to the Internet as a means of social networking and not that the Internet increases loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|author2=E. Ben-Artzi |title=Loneliness and Internet use|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2003|volume=19|pages=71–80|doi=10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introverts and neurotic individuals have also been shown to feel more comfortable revealing their "true-self" online than in face-to-face conversation and revealing the "real you" has been shown to help the discloser to form close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|author2=Galit Wainapel |author3=Shaul Fox |title="On the Internet No One Knows I'm an Introvert":Extroversion, Neuroticism, and Internet Interaction|journal=Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2002|volume=5|issue=2|pages=125–128|doi=10.1089/109493102753770507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social anxiety====

It can be very difficult for those with [[social anxiety]] to engage in face to face communication. These people can become anxious when meeting someone for the first time, speaking with someone attractive, or participating in group activities. This can limit their in-person interactions and deny them their basic needs of intimacy and belonging. With the absence of many of these worries in Internet communication, many with social anxieties use it to form social connections. It has been shown that individuals with social anxiety are more likely to use the Internet to form close relationships. These relationships are also shown to be stronger online relationships as opposed to weaker relationships (i.e. "acquaintances").&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt; Forming these relationships can also help a socially anxious person express their true-self and form their social identity. This identity often involves the groups a person is a part of because belonging to a group frequently becomes a part of one's self-concept.  Someone with social anxiety would be denied this because of their fear of face-to-face interaction. Therefore, disclosing with others online gives a socially anxious person access to a wide variety of people with which they can form relationships and belong to a group.&lt;ref name="McKennaGreenGleason2002" /&gt;

Socially anxious people are also shown to become less anxious over time if they have formed close online relationships. They have also been shown to broaden their social circles in the "real world" when they have had this time to form online relationships.&lt;ref name="McKennaGreenGleason2002" /&gt; One possibility for this occurrence may be that these online relationships can give the anxious individuals confidence in forming relationships outside of the Internet. Being able to practice communications online can show them they are capable of communicating and can lessen their anxieties in face to face communication.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt; They are also very likely to bring their online relationships into their offline lives in order to make them a "social reality" by sharing these relationships with family and friends in the real world.&lt;ref name="McKennaGreenGleason2002" /&gt;

===Online support groups===

Online support groups are another place where people from all over can come together to disclose common struggles. They provide an environment of mutual disclosure and support. People are more likely to use these forums to discuss personal struggles and disclose emotions and thoughts pertaining to these struggles than normal discussion forums. There is also a higher degree of reciprocity in online support groups than in normal discussion forums and reciprocity has been shown to help people feel valued after disclosing. Men and women are also equally likely to use these forums for disclosing personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barak|first1=A.|last2=Gluck-Ofri|first2=O.|title=Degree and Reciprocity of Self Disclosure in Online Forums|journal=Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2007|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9938|pages=407–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers===

While there are many benefits to engaging in self-disclosure online there are also some dangers. There is a relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and problematic behavior. Internet abuse can be defined as, "patterns of using the Internet that result in disturbances in a person's life but does not imply a specific disease process or addictive behavior."  When a person is high for Internet abuse and high for self-disclosure it can lead to dangerous behaviors like sending personal information (addresses, home phone number etc.) and photos to online acquaintances.  High ratings for Internet abuse and self-disclosure also positively influence online communication with all types of online relationships. These relationship types include long-distance relationships, in which people have met face to face and continue the relationship by communicating online; purely virtual relationships, where people meet online and stay in touch only by using the Internet; and migratory mixed-mode, where the relationship begins online and then proceeds to face to face interaction. The relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and dangerous behaviors could pose an even bigger problem with the high number of communications this group has with others, particularly those they have only communicated with online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=Ina|title=Application Use, Online Relationship Types, Self-Disclosure, and Internet Abuse Among Children and Youth: Implications for Education and Internet Safety Programs|journal=Educational Computing Research|year=2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=95–116|doi=10.2190/EC.45.1.e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The Internet, while providing most with a source of entertainment, knowledge, and social realms, is actually a large threat to children due to the ways in which they self-disclose. Their privacy is often more at risk than is an adults because of their openness to sites. Given that they are still developing, researchers say that they are in the "Cued Processors" group between the ages of eight and eleven. At this time, many children are using the Internet and are doing so alone, without the guidance and overseeing of an adult/guardian. Thus, they must use their own judgments to decide how much information to share on the various sites they visit.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As  "Cued Processors", however, they are only able to think logically about concrete events; the notion of their disclosures online being used against them is far in the abstract world. They will likely not think of any sort of consequences that could result from their disclosures, and this is just what online marketers and predators alike expect and are looking for. Combined with [[behavioral profiling]] tracking programs, online advertisers and predators can build a pretty clear image of the child and what he or she likes to do, where he or she lives, his or her phone number, his or her school district, and other sources of identifying information that they use to prompt the child to disclose without his or her really knowing. A common strategy is the use of brand characters in online games who "ask" for the information; children are especially likely to give out very personal information in this sort of setting. The children's vulnerability online is a product of their cognitive limitations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lwin | first1 = M. O. | last2 = Miyazaki | first2 = A. D. | last3 = Stanaland | first3 = A. S. | last4 = Lee | first4 = E. | year = 2012 | title = Online usage motive and information disclosure for preteen children | url = | journal = Young Consumers | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 345–356 | doi = 10.1108/17473611211282590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uses and gratifications theory]]  is often used to attempt to explain such things as motivation on the Internet. Studies have found that, if applied to the use of the Internet by children and their likelihood to disclose personal information, one can find significant [[correlations]] with various types of motivation. Children who use the Internet primarily as a source of information are less likely to give out personal information. Some theorize that these children are simply made to be more aware of the dangers of Internet disclosures and are more cautious because of this. But, children who mention social contact on the Internet as their first-order use are more often the ones who submit to the attempts of online marketers and predators who seek their personal contact information and behavioral preferences. These children have goals of social acceptance in mind, and it seems to them that acceptance can be easily gained from sharing and communicating with friends and strangers alike. Socializing motives reduce privacy concerns, and children will disclose nearly anything online in order to be seen and responded to socially. It was also discovered that a simple incentive is usually enough to elicit personal information from a child.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Parents' knowledge of their children's Internet use is rapidly decreasing. Children are withholding more and more from their parents, including how much information they are sharing over the Internet. Parent-child self-disclosure about this topic needs to be increased if interventions are to help keep children safer online. Notably, there are many parents who have even admitted to allowing their children to lie about their ages on [[social media]] sites in order to gain access to them. Parents, thus, are encouraged to remain open to discussing such things with their children, to use better judgment themselves when making decisions about their children's Internet usage, and to provide them with education about how privacy on the Internet is a risky notion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Today, many regulations are being proposed and implemented that will hopefully help protect children's personal information on the Internet. However, these will not be enough to guarantee safe exchanges of self-disclosure, so adults still must be open to discussion with their children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==In education==

Self-disclosure is an important matter to consider in the realm of education. The varying ways that it can impact social relations adds a new and important dynamic to the classroom. There are different results and experiences that students and teachers see from the implementation of self-disclosure in the classroom. The relationships that will be addressed through the lens of self-disclosure include the student to teacher relationship, the student to student relationship and how cultural relations impacts the situation as a whole.

===Student to teacher relations===

The tone of the classroom is set by the attitudes and behaviors of those who participate in it. The teacher often has the most powerful role in leading a classroom and how that class will interact and connect through the subject matter. The practice of self-disclosure in the interactions between the teachers and the students has an impact on the classroom atmosphere and how the people perform in that atmosphere. The decision to practice self-disclosure as a teacher has many benefits and challenges.

====Benefits====

When the teacher engages in self-disclosure with the students, it opens up a new channel of communication in the classroom. As the teacher shares more information about who they are and their personal life, the students begin to see a new side of their teacher that is more than the person that stands in the front of their classroom everyday. The teacher is seen as a real person with their own difficulties and struggles in life. This would allow the teacher to appear more relatable to the students which would promote better student to teacher communication. Of course, the information shared with the class must be appropriate and relevant. A teacher may use an illustration of a concept using an example from their own life in order to connect with a particular audience in the class. These connections with the teacher promotes a more productive relationship.

As the teacher sets the tone of self-disclosure, students feel more willing to share in the practice of self-disclosure as well. The teacher demonstrates and helps to guide the students in understanding what is appropriate information to share in public discourses.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobin|first=Lad|year=2009|title=Self-Disclosure as a Strategic Teaching Tool|url=|journal=College English|volume=73|pages=196–206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the students feel more comfortable with the teacher and begin sharing more about their own lives, the environment of the classroom is one of camaraderie and friendship. By understanding the people in the classroom on a deeper level can open up opportunities to provide support to those involved. The teacher can better understand who the students are, what they struggle with, what their strengths are and what they need to succeed. Self-disclosure from student to teacher allows the teacher to best support the students based on their individual needs, therefore providing an improved education.

====Challenges====

With implementing self-disclosure into the classroom, comes a set of negative consequences and challenges. As the teacher shares more about their personal life, the students may become overly comfortable with the teacher. This could lead to a lack of respect for the teacher or an inability to maintain appropriate superior relationship. Self-disclosure may blur the lines of the roles between the student and the teacher, which could disrupt the authority the teacher needs to maintain their role in the classroom and have an effective teaching persona.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is the case that not all students will connect to this method of teaching. Some students may not choose to participate in this environment which could lead them to feel alienated. Self-disclosure from the teacher needs to be taken into deep consideration so that the sharing of information does not take away from the education being transferred.

There are some risks involved in bringing self-disclosure into the classroom when students begin sharing information with the teacher. As the student is more open with the teacher, there is the chance that the student could share information that would require the teacher to follow a reporting procedure. If a student reveals information about themselves in confidence to the teacher that implies that the students life is potentially at risk, or other matters of equal seriousness that would need to be reported to the school guidance counselor. Revealing this information although confidentiality was implied would inevitably break the trust the teacher has built with the student, ultimately harming their relationship. This hurt relationship could negatively impact that students ability to learn in the classroom. In another scenario, students may not fully understand the differences between public and private discourse. This would lead students to have conversations of self-disclosure in the classroom when the timing is not appropriate, therefore, taking away from the educational matters at hand.

==Culture ==

Self-disclosure, just like anything varies and differs depending on the culture. Collectivistic culture and individualism are two types of ways to explain self disclosure is a culture. If a country is more on the collectivistic side then they will tend to disclose themselves more as an Avatar, like in China and Germany. However, in a more individualist culture setting people open up more about themselves, even personal details, like in America. There is also a difference in the boy vs. girl culture. Girls tend to open up more and easier than most boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Betty|title=Differences in Self-Disclosure among Cultures and Genders: A Comparative Study in Online Social Networks|url=https://www.academia.edu/4595770/Differences_in_Self-Disclosure_among_Cultures_and_Genders_A_Comparative_Study_in_Online_Social_Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each culture has a different idea about what and how much self-disclosure is acceptable. For example, American students tend to share more in class with their peers than Chinese students. They are usually more open about themselves and interests with most of their classmates than students in other countries. The difference is seen in the internet as well. Korean students usually talk more in blog form on social media pages keeping the posts short and to the point. However, American students share more often and share more personal information to their followers. Cultures like Korea and China, the collectivistic cultures, are more reserved whereas, the American culture is more about disclosing a lot of personal details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lizprovasi.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/self-disclosure-2-2/|title=Self-disclosure|last=Provasi|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-04-26|website=Cultural Connections|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Five senses.jpg|thumb|318x318px|Five Aristotelian senses and their respective sensory organs inherent among ''[[Homo sapiens]]'']]
[[File:Claesz., Pieter - Still Life with Musical Instruments - 1623.jpg|thumb|270px|An [[allegory]] of five senses. Still Life  by [[Pieter Claesz]], 1623. The painting illustrates the senses through musical instruments, a compass, a book, food and drink, a mirror, [[incense]] and an open perfume bottle. The [[tortoise]] may be an illustration of touch or an allusion to the opposite (the tortoise isolating in its shell).]]

A '''sense''' is a [[physiological]] capacity of [[organism]]s that provides data for [[perception]]. The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]] (or [[cognitive science]]), and [[philosophy of perception]]. The [[nervous system]] has a specific [[sensory nervous system]], and a '''sense organ''', or '''sensor''', dedicated to each sense.

Humans have a multitude of sensors. Sight ([[Visual perception|vision]]), hearing ([[Hearing|audition]]), taste ([[taste|gustation]]), smell ([[olfaction]]), and touch ([[Somatosensory system|somatosensation]]) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these [[sensory modalities]] include temperature ([[thermoception]]), kinesthetic sense ([[proprioception]]), pain ([[nociception]]), balance ([[equilibrioception]]), vibration ([[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreception]]), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different [[chemoreceptor]]s for detecting [[salt]] and [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations in the blood, or sense of [[hunger]] and sense of [[thirst]]). However, what constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders lie between responses to related stimuli.

Other animals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other [[mammals]] while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] in very different ways. Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense [[electrical field|electrical]] and [[magnetic field]]s, and detect [[water pressure]] and currents.

==Definition==
[[File:Peacock served in full plumage (detail of BRUEGHEL Taste, Hearing and Touch).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste'', [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], 1618]]
A broadly acceptable definition of a sense would be "A system that consists of a group of sensory cell types that responds to a specific physical phenomenon, and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted." There is no firm agreement as to the number of senses because of differing definitions of what constitutes a sense.

The senses are frequently divided into exteroceptive and interoceptive:
* ''Exteroceptive senses'' are senses that perceive the body's own position, motion, and state, known as ''proprioceptive senses''. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, as well as [[thermoception]] (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak [[magnetoception]] (direction).&lt;ref name="Voustianiouk 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Voustianiouk A, Kaufmann H |title=Magnetic fields and the central nervous system |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=111 |issue=11 |pages=1934–5 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11068225 |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(00)00487-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proprioceptive senses include [[nociception]] (pain); [[equilibrioception]] (balance); [[proprioception]] (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).
* ''Interoceptive senses'' are senses that perceive [[#Other internal senses|sensations in internal organs]].

Non-human animals may possess senses that are absent in humans, such as [[electroreception]] and detection of [[polarized light]].

In [[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Ayatana]] or "sense-base" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.

===Sight===

[[Image:Pietro Paolini - Allegory of the Five Senses - Walters 372768.jpg|left|thumb|In this painting by [[Pietro Paolini]], each individual represents one of the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]

'''[[Visual perception|Sight]]''' or '''vision''' (adjectival form: visual/optical) is the capability of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible [[light]] on [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the [[retina]] of each eye that generates electrical [[Action potential|nerve impulses]] for varying colors, hues, and brightness.  There are two types of photoreceptors: [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]]. Rods are very sensitive to light, but do not distinguish colors.  Cones distinguish colors, but are less sensitive to dim light. There is some disagreement as to whether this constitutes one, two or three senses. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two senses, given that  different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that [[stereopsis]], the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the [[visual cortex]] of the brain where patterns and objects in [[Real image|images]] are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.

The inability to see is called [[blindness]]. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from [[stroke]] ([[infarct]]s in the brain).  Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications.

People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as [[blindsight]]. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behaviour to the stimulus.

On February 14, 2013 researchers developed a [[neural implant]] that gives [[rat]]s the ability to sense [[infrared]] light which for the first time provides [[living creatures]] with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/14/implant-gives-rats-sixth-sense-for-infrared-light|title=Implant gives rats sixth sense for infrared light|work=Wired UK|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearing===

'''[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]]''' or '''audition''' (adjectival form: auditory) is the sense of [[sound]] perception. Hearing is all about vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the [[inner ear]], which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml |title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing, Physics Factbook by Glenn Elert (ed) |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called [[deafness]] or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as [[Seismic communication|vibrations conducted through the body]] by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdeaf.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/Information%20Sheets/Deaf%20Culture%20and%20Communication%20-%20A%20Basic%20Guide.pdf|title=Deaf Culture and Communication: A Basic Guide|work=Victorian Deaf Society|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taste===

'''[[Taste]]''' or '''gustation''' (adjectival form: gustatory) is one of the traditional five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the "sense" of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. [[File:Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project]] Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five [[basic taste]]s: [[sweet]], [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitter]], [[sour]], [[Saltiness|salty]] and [[umami]]. Other tastes such as calcium&lt;ref name="Tordoff 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tordoff MG |title=Gene discovery and the genetic basis of calcium consumption |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=649–59 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18499198 |pmc=2574908 |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.04.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciencedaily 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080820163008.htm |title=That Tastes ...

The inability to taste is called [[ageusia]].

===Smell===

'''[[Olfaction|Smell]]''' or '''olfaction''' (adjectival form: olfactory) is the other "chemical" sense. Unlike taste, there are hundreds of olfactory receptors (388 according to one source&lt;ref name=Moonwalk
&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/sense-of-smell-olfactory-receptors.html |title=A Sense of Smell: Olfactory Receptors |work=Sandwalk |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), each binding to a particular molecular feature. Odor molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what we perceive as the molecule's smell. [[File:The sense of smell Philippe Mercier.jpg|thumb|The sense of smell [[Philippe Mercier]]]] In the brain, olfaction is processed by the [[olfactory system]]. [[Olfactory receptor neuron]]s in the [[Human nose|nose]] differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called [[anosmia]]. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html |title=The Surprising Impact of Taste and Smell |work=LiveScience }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touch===

'''[[Somatosensory system|Touch]]''' or '''somatosensation''' (adjectival form: somatic), also called '''[[tactition]]'''  (adjectival form: tactile) or '''[[Mechanoreceptor|mechanoreception]]''', is a perception resulting from activation of neural [[Mechanoreceptor|receptors]], generally in the [[skin]] including [[hair follicle]]s, but also in the [[tongue]], [[throat]], and [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. A variety of [[pressure]] receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of [[itch]]ing caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Sun Zhao 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun YG, Zhao ZQ, Meng XL, Yin J, Liu XY, Chen ZF |title=Cellular basis of itch sensation |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5947 |pages=1531–4 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19661382 |pmc=2786498 |doi=10.1126/science.1174868 |url=|bibcode=2009Sci...325.1531S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile [[anesthesia]].  [[Paresthesia]] is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or [[numbness]] of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.

== Other senses ==

===Balance and acceleration===
{{Main|Vestibular system}}

'''[[Balance (ability)|Balance]]''', '''[[equilibrioception]]''', or '''vestibular sense''' is the sense that allows an organism to sense body movement, direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance. The organ of equilibrioception is the vestibular labyrinthine system found in both of the [[inner ear]]s. In technical terms, this organ is responsible for two senses of [[angular momentum]] acceleration and [[linear acceleration]] (which also senses [[gravity]]), but they are known together as equilibrioception.

The [[vestibular nerve]] conducts information from sensory receptors in three [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] that sense motion of fluid in three [[semicircular canal]]s caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head.  The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]], which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of [[otolith]]s (which are small crystals of [[calcium carbonate]]) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.

===Temperature===

'''[[Thermoception]]''' is the sense of '''heat''' and the absence of heat ('''cold''') by the [[skin]] and internal skin passages, or, rather, the '''[[heat flux]]''' (the rate of [[heat flow]]) in these areas. There are specialized receptors for cold (declining temperature) and for heat (increasing temperature). The cold receptors play an important part in the animal's sense of smell, telling wind direction.  The heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in [[pit vipers]]. The [[Thermoreceptor|thermoceptors]] in the skin are quite different from the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] thermoceptors in the brain ([[POAH|hypothalamus]]), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.

===Proprioception===

'''[[Proprioception]]''', the '''kinesthetic sense''', provides the [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.&lt;ref name="roblesdelatorre"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf |title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments |work=International Society for Haptics |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===

'''[[Nociception]]''' (physiological [[pain]]) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="Fulbrigh 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fulbright RK, Troche CJ, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Wexler BE |title=Functional MR imaging of regional brain activation associated with the affective experience of pain |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=177 |issue=5 |pages=1205–10 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11641204 |doi=10.2214/ajr.177.5.1771205 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main function of pain is to attract our [[attention]] to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.

===Sexual stimulation===
{{Main|Sexual stimulation}}

'''[[Sexual stimulation]]''' is any [[stimulation|stimulus]] (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains [[sexual arousal]], and may lead to [[orgasm]]. Distinct from the general sense of touch, sexual stimulation is strongly tied to hormonal activity and chemical triggers in the body. Although sexual arousal may arise without [[physical stimulation]], achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation (stimulation of the Krause-Finger [[Bulboid corpuscle|corpuscles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abdominalkey.com/sensory-corpuscles/|title=Sensory Corpuscles|last=Themes|first=UFO|date=2017-03-29|work=Abdominal Key|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in erogenous zones of the body).

===Other internal senses{{anchor|Interoception}}===
An '''internal sense''' also known as [[interoception]]&lt;ref name="Craig 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig AD |title=Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=500–5 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12965300 |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "any sense that is normally stimulated from within the body".&lt;ref name="Dunn Galton 2010"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dunn BD, Galton HC, Morgan R, etal |title=Listening to your heart. How interoception shapes emotion experience and intuitive decision making |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1835–44 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21106893 |doi=10.1177/0956797610389191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These involve numerous sensory receptors in internal organs, such as stretch receptors that are neurologically linked to the brain. Interoception is thought to be atypical in clinical conditions such as alexithymia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Punit|last2=Hall|first2=Richard|last3=Catmur|first3=Caroline|last4=Bird|first4=Geoffrey|date=2016-08-01|title=Alexithymia, not autism, is associated with impaired interoception|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945216300594|journal=Cortex|volume=81|pages=215–220|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.03.021|pmc=4962768|pmid=27253723}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some examples of specific receptors are:
* [[Hunger (motivational state)|Hunger]] is a sensation that is governed by a set of brain structures (e.g., the [[hypothalamus]]) that are responsible for [[energy homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Hunger - CNS energy homeostasis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farr OM, Li CS, Mantzoros CS | title = Central nervous system regulation of eating: Insights from human brain imaging | journal = Metab.

* [[Pulmonary stretch receptors]] are found in the lungs and control the [[respiratory rate]].
* [[Peripheral chemoreceptors]] in the brain monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the brain to give a feeling of [[suffocation]] if carbon dioxide levels get too high.&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks How Your Lungs Work"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/lung3.htm |title=How Your Lungs Work |work=HowStuffWorks }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] is an area of the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] in the brain that receives inputs from [[blood]]-borne [[drug]]s or [[hormone]]s, and communicates with the [[vomiting center]].
* Chemoreceptors in the circulatory system also measure salt levels and prompt thirst if they get too high; they can also respond to high [[blood sugar]] levels in diabetics.
* [[Cutaneous receptor]]s in the skin not only respond to touch, pressure, temperature and vibration, but also respond to vasodilation in the skin such as [[blushing]].
* Stretch receptors in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] sense gas distension that may result in colic pain.
* Stimulation of sensory receptors in the [[esophagus]] result in sensations felt in the throat when [[swallowing]], [[vomiting]], or during [[acid reflux]].
* Sensory receptors in [[pharynx]] mucosa, similar to touch receptors in the skin, sense foreign objects such as food that may result in a [[gag reflex]] and corresponding gagging sensation.
* Stimulation of sensory receptors in the [[urinary bladder]] and [[rectum]] may result in sensations of fullness.
* Stimulation of stretch sensors that sense dilation of various blood vessels may result in pain, for example headache caused by vasodilation of brain arteries.
* Cardioception refers to the perception of the activity of the heart.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* [[Opsin]]s and [[direct DNA damage]] in [[melanocyte]]s and [[keratinocyte]]s can sense [[ultraviolet]] radiation, which plays a role in pigmentation and [[sunburn]].

==Perception not based on a specific sensory organ==

===Time===
{{main | time perception}}
'''[[time perception|Chronoception]]''' refers to how the passage of time is perceived and experienced. Although the [[time perception|sense of time]] is not associated with a specific [[sensory system]], the work of [[psychologist]]s and [[neuroscientist]]s indicates that human brains do have a system governing the [[perception]] of [[time]],&lt;ref name="Rao 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao SM, Mayer AR, Harrington DL |title=The evolution of brain activation during temporal processing |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=317–23 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11224550 |doi=10.1038/85191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.unisci.com/stories/20011/0227013.htm | title= Brain Areas Critical To Human Time Sense Identified | accessdate= | date= 2001-02-27 |publisher= UniSci – Daily University Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of a highly distributed system involving the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]]. One particular component, the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], is responsible for the [[circadian rhythm|circadian (or daily) rhythm]], while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range ([[ultradian]]) timekeeping.

One or more [[dopaminergic pathways]] in the [[central nervous system]] appear to have a strong modulatory influence on [[mental chronometry]], particularly interval timing.&lt;ref name="Amph-DA reaction time"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker KL, Lamichhane D, Caetano MS, Narayanan NS | title = Executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and timing deficits | journal = Front. Integr. Neurosci. | volume = 7 | page = 75 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24198770 | pmc = 3813949 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2013.00075 | quote = Manipulations of dopaminergic signaling profoundly influence interval timing, leading to the hypothesis that dopamine influences internal pacemaker, or “clock,” activity. For instance, amphetamine, which increases concentrations of dopamine at the synaptic cleft advances the start of responding during interval timing, whereas antagonists of D2 type dopamine receptors typically slow timing;... Depletion of dopamine in healthy volunteers impairs timing, while amphetamine releases synaptic dopamine and speeds up timing. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agency===
{{main | Sense of agency}}

The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, can lead to a loss of this sense, causing a person to feel like a machine or even leading to delusions of being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that it would happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ego Tunnel | last = Metzinger | first = Thomas | pages = 117–118 | year = 2009 | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04567-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in non-pathological cases, there is a measurable difference between making a decision and the feeling of agency. Through methods such as [[Neuroscience of free will#Libet experiment|the Libet experiment]], a gap of half a second or more can be detected from the time when there are detectable neurological signs of a decision having been made to the time when the subject actually becomes conscious of the decision.

There are also experiments in which an illusion of agency is induced in psychologically normal subjects. In Wegner and Wheatley 1999, subjects were given instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person—acting as a test subject but actually a confederate—had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement. Experimenters were able to arrange for subjects to perceive certain "forced stops" as if they were their own choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wegner D, Wheatley T | title = Apparent Mental Causation | journal = American Psychologist | year = 1999 | volume = 54 | number = 7 | pages = 480–92 | url = http://cogsci.ucd.ie/introtocogsci/docs/Agency-1999.pdf | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.7.480 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Metzinger | first = Thomas | date= 2003 | title = Being No One | page = 508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familiarity===

[[Recognition memory]] is sometimes divided into two functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mandler | year = 1980 | title =  Recognizing: the judgement of prior occurrence | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 87| issue = 3 | pages = 252–271 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.87.3.252| url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/58b2c2fc }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of [[deja vu]]. The temporal lobe, in particular the [[perirhinal cortex]], responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the sense of familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15&amp;nbsp;Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40&amp;nbsp;Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Bidirectional Modulation of Recognition Memory | authors = Jonathan W. Ho, Devon L. Poeta, Tara K. Jacobson, Timothy A. Zolnik, Garrett T. Neske, Barry W. Connors and Rebecca D. Burwell | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | number = 39 | date = 30 September 2015 | pages = 13323–13335 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2278-15.2015| pmid = 26424881 | pmc = 4588607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, stimulation at 30–40&amp;nbsp;Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones—they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Detecting and discriminating novel objects: The impact of perirhinal cortex disconnection on hippocampal activity patterns | author = Kinnavane, Lisa and Amin, Eman and Olarte-Sánchez, Cristian M. and Aggleton, John P. | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 26 | number = 11 | issn = 1098-1063 | doi = 10.1002/hipo.22615 | pmid = 27398938 | pmc = 5082501 | pages = 1393–1413 | year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-human senses==

===Analogous to human senses===
Other living organisms have receptors to sense the world around them, including many of the senses listed above for humans. However, the mechanisms and capabilities vary widely.

====Smell====
Most non-human mammals have a much keener sense of smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar.{{Citation needed|reason=Any non-anectodal sources?|date=December 2017}} An example of smell in non-mammals is that of [[sharks]], which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine the direction of a smell. They follow the nostril that first detected the smell.&lt;ref name="Gardiner Atema 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardiner|first1=Jayne M.|last2=Atema|first2=Jelle|title=The Function of Bilateral Odor Arrival Time Differences in Olfactory Orientation of Sharks|journal=Current Biology|volume=20| issue=13| year=2010| pages=1187–1191| issn=0960-9822| doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.053|pmid=20541411|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(10)00591-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insect]]s have olfactory receptors on their [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].

====Vomeronasal organ====
Many animals ([[salamander]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[mammal]]s) have a [[vomeronasal organ]]&lt;ref name="Takami 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takami S |title=Recent progress in the neurobiology of the [[vomeronasal organ]] |journal=Microsc. Res. Tech. |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=228–50 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12203701 |doi=10.1002/jemt.10094 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is connected with the mouth cavity. In mammals it is mainly used to detect [[pheromones]] of marked territory, trails, and sexual state. Reptiles like [[snake]]s and [[monitor lizard]]s make extensive use of it as a smelling organ by transferring scent molecules to the vomeronasal organ with the tips of the forked tongue. In reptiles the vomeronasal organ is commonly referred to as Jacobsons organ. In mammals, it is often associated with a special behavior called [[flehmen]] characterized by uplifting of the lips. The organ is [[Human vestigiality|vestigial in humans]], because associated neurons have not been found that give any sensory input in humans.&lt;ref name="Frasnelli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frasnelli J, Lundström JN, Boyle JA, Katsarkas A, Jones-Gotman M |title=The vomeronasal organ is not involved in the perception of endogenous odors |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=450–60 |date=March 2011 |pmid=20578170 |pmc=3607301 |doi=10.1002/hbm.21035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taste====
[[Flies]] and [[butterflies]] have taste organs on their feet, allowing them to taste anything they land on. [[Catfish]] have taste organs across their entire bodies, and can taste anything they touch, including chemicals in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Atema, Jelle (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZbRp0z5-p0C&amp;pg=PA57 "Chemical senses, chemical signals, and feeding behavior in fishes"] p. 57–101. In: Bardach, JE ''Fish behavior and its use in the capture and culture of fishes', The WorldFish Center, {{ISBN|978-971-02-0003-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vision and light sensing====
[[Cat]]s have the ability to see in low light, which is due to muscles surrounding their [[Iris (anatomy)|irides]]–which contract and expand their pupils–as well as to the [[tapetum lucidum]], a reflective membrane that optimizes the image.
[[Crotalinae|Pit vipers]], [[Pythonidae|pythons]] and some [[Boidae|boa]]s have organs that allow them to detect [[infrared]] light, such that these snakes are able to sense the body heat of their prey. The [[common vampire bat]] may also have an infrared sensor on its nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/AFShome/s/l/slavic/public/html/courses/vampires/images/bats/vambat.html|title=The illustrated story of the Vampire bat|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that [[birds]] and some other animals are [[tetrachromats]] and have the ability to see in the [[ultraviolet]] down to 300 nanometers. [[Bees]] and [[dragonflies]]&lt;ref name="van Kleef Berry 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Kleef| first1=J.| last2=Berry| first2=R.|last3=Stange| first3=G.| title=Directional Selectivity in the Simple Eye of an Insect|journal=Journal of Neuroscience| volume=28|issue=11| year=2008| issn=0270-6474| doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5556-07.2008 | pmid=18337415| pages=2845–2855}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also able to see in the ultraviolet. [[Mantis shrimp]]s can perceive both [[polarized light]] and [[multispectral]] images and have twelve distinct kinds of color receptors, unlike humans which have three kinds and most mammals which have two kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6756/full/401873a0.html| title=Ultraviolet vision: the colourful world of the mantis shrimp| year=1999 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=401 |pages=873–874 |doi=10.1038/44751 |author1=Justin Marshall |author2=Johannes Oberwinkler |pmid=10553902 |issue=6756|bibcode = 1999Natur.401..873M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cephalopod]]s have the ability to change color using [[chromatophore]]s in their skin. Researchers believe that [[opsin]]s in the skin can sense different wavelengths of light and help the creatures choose a coloration that camouflages them, in addition to light input from the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedishonscience.stanford.edu/posts/octopus-vision-is-in-the-skin-of-the-beholder/ Octopus vision, it's in the eye (or skin) of the beholder]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers hypothesize that [[cephalopod eye]]s in species which only have a single [[photoreceptor protein]] may use [[chromatic aberration]] to turn monochromatic vision into color vision,&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-explanation-cephalopods-black-white-vision.html Study proposes explanation for how cephalopods see color, despite black and white vision]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining pupils shaped like the letter U, the letter W, or a [[dumbbell]], as well as explaining the need for colorful mating displays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.futurity.org/octopus-color-pupils-1196262/ Odd pupils let ‘colorblind’ octopuses see colors]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some cephalopods can distinguish the polarization of light.

====Balance====
Many invertebrates have a [[statocyst]], which is a sensor for acceleration and orientation that works very differently from the mammalian's semi-circular canals.

====Sensing gravity====
Some plants (such as mustard) have genes that are necessary for the plant to sense the direction of gravity.  If these genes are disabled by a mutation, a plant cannot grow upright.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Zimmer, "The Search for Genes Leads to Unexpected Places", ''New York Times'', April 27, 2010, page D1, New York edition [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html Plants sensing gravity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not analogous to human senses===
In addition, some animals have senses that humans do not, including the following:

==== Echolocation ====
{{Main|Animal echolocation}}
Certain animals, including [[bat]]s and [[cetacea]]ns, have the ability to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like [[sonar]]). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.

Blind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as [[human echolocation]].

==== Electroreception ====
'''[[Electroreception]]''' (or '''electroception''') is the ability to detect [[electric field]]s. Several species of fish, [[shark]]s, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]]. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social [[communication]]. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.

The only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the [[dolphin]] and [[monotreme]] orders. Among these mammals, the [[platypus]]&lt;ref name="Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209085517/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html |archivedate=1999-02-09 |title=Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the most acute sense of electroception.

A dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in [[Whisker|vibrissal crypts]] arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.&lt;ref name="Drake 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|title=Life: Dolphin can sense electric fields: Ability may help species track prey in murky waters|journal=Science News|volume=180| issue=5|year=2011| pages=12–12| issn=0036-8423|doi=10.1002/scin.5591800512}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey. This permits the dolphin to locate prey from the seafloor where sediment limits visibility and echolocation.

Spiders have been shown to detect electric fields to determine a suitable time to extend web for 'ballooning'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morley |first1=Erica |title=Electric Fields Elicit Ballooning in Spiders |journal=Current Biology |date=July 5, 2018 |volume=28 |issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body modification]] enthusiasts have experimented with magnetic implants to attempt to replicate this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/05/implant-gives-man-th.html|title=Implant gives man the sense of "magnetic vision" |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.

==== Magnetoception ====
'''[[Magnetoception]]''' (or '''magnetoreception''') is the ability to detect the direction one is facing based on the Earth's [[magnetic field]]. Directional awareness is most commonly observed in [[bird]]s, which rely on their magnetic sense to navigate during migration.&lt;ref name="Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/magsense/ms.html |title=The Magnetic Sense of Animals |work=Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baylor College of Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/news/item.cfm?newsID=5575 |title=Built-in GPS in birds in tune with Earth's magnetic field |work= Baylor College of Medicine |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu Dickman 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=L.-Q. |last2=Dickman |first2=J.

====Hygroreception====
'''[[Hygroreception]]''' is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enjin|first=Anders|last2=Zaharieva|first2=Emanuela E.|last3=Frank|first3=Dominic D.|last4=Mansourian|first4=Suzan|last5=Suh|first5=Greg S.

====Infrared sensing====
{{Main|Infrared sensing in snakes}}

The ability to sense [[infrared]] thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of [[snakes]]. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to "see" radiant heat at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[μm]] to a degree of accuracy such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.&lt;ref&gt;(Kardong &amp; Mackessy 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.&lt;ref&gt;(Krochmal et al. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.&lt;ref&gt;(Pough et al. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[Loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target [[endothermic]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.

In spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors – while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"&gt;(Gracheva et al. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original "resting" or "inactive" temperature.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"/&gt;

==== Other ====
*'''Pressure detection''' uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the [[gas bladder]] to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the [[weather fish]] and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.
* '''Current detection''' is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of [[vortex|vortices]], found in the [[lateral line]] of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are [[hair cell]]s, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the [[electroception|electrical sense]] are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.
*'''[[Polarized light]] direction/detection''' is used by [[bees]] to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. [[Cuttlefish]], some [[beetles]], and [[mantis shrimp]] can also perceive the polarization of light.  Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called [[Haidinger's brush]], however this is considered an [[entoptic phenomenon]] rather than a separate sense.
* '''[[Slit sensilla]]e of spiders''' detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.

===Plant senses===
By using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, gravity, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems  functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as functionalism and computationalism.

[[File:1668 Gérard de Lairesse - Allegory of the Five Senses.jpg|thumb|[[Gérard de Lairesse|Lairesse's]] ''Allegory of the Five Senses'']]

In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], there were commonly reckoned to be '''five wits''' or '''five senses'''.&lt;ref name=Furness1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=King Lear|title=Shakespeare|page=187|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|oclc=1932507|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=5|edition=7th|year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the words "sense" and "wit" were synonyms,&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt; so the senses were known as the five outward wits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|article=wit|encyclopedia=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories|publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=1991 |isbn=0-87779-603-3| oclc=24246335 |pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Words|author=[[C. S.

The traditional five senses are enumerated as the "five material faculties" (''{{IAST|pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ avakanti}}'') in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the [[Katha Upanishad]] (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the "[[chariot]]" of the body, guided by the mind as "chariot driver".

Depictions of the five traditional senses as [[allegory]] became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s. A typical example is [[Gérard de Lairesse]]'s ''Allegory of the Five Senses'' (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a [[convex mirror]], hearing is the [[cupid]]-like boy with a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.

The term "'''''sinthome'''''" ({{IPA-fr|sɛ̃tom|lang}}) was introduced by [[Jacques Lacan]] in his seminar ''Le sinthome'' (1975–76).  According to Lacan, ''sinthome'' is the Latin way (1495 Rabelais, IV,63&lt;ref&gt;The term used by Rabelais is not sinthome but symptomates : « Amis, respondit Pantagruel, à tous les doubtes et questions par vous proposées compete une seule solution, et à tous telz symptomates et accidents une seule medicine. » (François Rabelais, ''Les Cinq Livres'', La Pochothèque, 1994, p. 1193)&lt;/ref&gt;) of spelling the Greek origin of the French word ''symptôme'', meaning [[symptom]]. The seminar is a continuing elaboration of his [[topology]], extending the previous seminar's focus (''RSI'') on the [[Borromean rings|Borromean Knot]] and an exploration of the writings of [[James Joyce]]. Lacan redefines the psychoanalytic symptom in terms of his topology of the subject.

In "Psychoanalysis and its Teachings" (''Écrits'') Lacan views the symptom as inscribed in a writing process, not as [[ciphered message]] which was the traditional notion. In his seminar "L'angoisse" (1962–63) he states that the symptom does not call for interpretation: in itself it is not a call to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] but a pure [[jouissance]] addressed to no one. This is a shift from the linguistic definition of the symptom — as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] — to his assertion that "the symptom can only be defined as the way in which each subject enjoys (''jouit'') the unconscious in so far as the unconscious determines the subject." He goes from conceiving the symptom as a message which can be deciphered by reference to the unconscious structured like a language to seeing it as the trace of the particular modality of the subject's ''jouissance''.

This shift from linguistics to topology constitutes the status of the ''sinthome'' as unanalyzable. The seminar extends the theory of the Borromean knot, which in ''RSI'' (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) had been proposed as the structure of the subject, by adding the ''sinthome'' as the fourth ring to the triad already mentioned, tying together a knot which constantly threatens to come undone. Since meaning (''sens'') is already figured within the knot, at the intersection of the Symbolic and the Imaginary, it follows that the function of the ''sinthome'' — knotting together [[the Real]], [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] and [[the Symbolic]] — is beyond meaning.

'''Skopos theory''' ({{lang-de|Skopostheorie}}) is a concept from the field of [[translation studies]]. It provides an insight into the nature of translation as a purposeful activity, which is directly applicable to every [[translation project]].

It was established by the German linguists [[Hans Vermeer]] and [[Katharina Reiß]] and comprises the idea that [[translating]] and [[interpreting]] should primarily take into account the [[Function (language)|function]] of the [[target text]].

Skopos theory focuses on translation as an activity with an aim or purpose, and on the intended addressee or audience of the translation. To translate means to produce a target text in a target setting for a target purpose and target addressees in target circumstances. In skopos theory, the status of the source text is lower than it is in equivalence-based theories of translation. The source is an "offer of information", which the translator turns into an "offer of information" for the target audience.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Nord, ''Translating as a Purposeful Activity'', St. Jerome Publishing, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Kussmaul explains this theory as: "the functional approach has a great affinity with ''Skopos theory''. The function of a translation depends on the knowledge, expectations, values and norms of the target readers, who are again influenced by the situation they are in and by the culture. These factors determine whether the function of the source text or passages in the source text can be preserved or have to be modified or even changed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kussmaul, ''Training The Translator'', John Benjamins Publishing Co, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules of skopos theory include:
# the TT must be internally coherent
# the TT must be coherent with the ST
# the TT is determined by its skopos.

'''''Spice Chess''''' is an [[artist's multiple]] by the [[Japan]]ese artist [[Takako Saito]], while she was resident in the [[United States]]. Originally manufactured winter 1964-65, and offered for sale March 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Offered in Vacuum TrapEzoid Fluxus Newspaper #5, March 1965&lt;/ref&gt; the work is one of a famous series of disrupted chess sets referred to as ''Fluxchess'' or ''Flux Chess'', made for [[George Maciunas|George Maciunas']] [[Fluxus|Fluxshop]] at his [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] loft, [[SoHo]], [[New York City]] and later through his Fluxus Mail-Order Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/archive/archive_mayor.htm Tate Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110140636/http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/archive/archive_mayor.htm |date=2005-11-10 }} Retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Takako Saito engaged with Duchamp's practice but also with masculinist cold war metaphors by taking up chess as a subject of [her] art. Saito's fluxchess works... question the primacy of vision to chess, along with notions of perception and in aesthetic experience more generally.... Her "Smell Chess," "Sound Chess" and "Weight Chess" reworked the game of chess so that players would be forced to hone non-visual perception, such as the olfactory sense, tactility, and aurality, in order to follow chess rules." Claudia Mesch&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Reconstruction, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=2012-07-13 }} Retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The set follows the normal rules of [[chess]], but replaces the traditional pieces with identically-shaped transparent plastic [[vial]]s filled with different spices for each of the different pieces. The set includes white [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] made of [[Cinnamon]], white [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] of [[Nutmeg]], the white [[Knight (chess)|knights]] are [[Ginger]], black [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]], [[Cumin]] and the Black [[King (chess)|King]] made of [[Asafoetida]]. The white [[Queen (chess)|Queen]] is [[Anise]], the black [[Cayenne pepper]].&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt; The board is also made of transparent plastic. To start the game, both players have to familiarise themselves with each of the 12 smells involved, instead of the more normal reliance on sight.

==Ay-O and George Maciunas==
As a 'basically untrained' &lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; artist in [[Tokyo]], Saito's opportunities to exhibit work were severely limited.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; After taking English lessons, Saito arrived in New York in 1963 on a work visa as an assistant textile wholesaler, 'vaguely [dreaming] of engaging herself in the unknown New York avant-garde'.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p119&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware of Fluxus, she concentrated on her own work for a few months before meeting George Maciunas through a mutual friend, [[Ay-O]]. An admirer of Japanese art, Maciunas asked Saito if she could make boxes similar to the [[Paulownia]] boxes he owned, which had been made to protect expensive ceramics.&lt;ref name="Perform"&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005/p122&lt;/ref&gt; Her skill exceeded expectations, leading him to write that 'her craftmanship springs from Japanese tradition for perfection and is unmatched among contemporary artists working in wood and paper.' &lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, quoted in Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GrinderChess.jpg|thumb|left|270px|''Grinder Chess'', 1965 This example Reflux  Edition, 1990]]

===''Fluxchess''===
Maciunas revered [[Marcel Duchamp]], and 'found it amusing that both Duchamp and he were chess fanatics.'&lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p123&lt;/ref&gt; As a homage to Duchamp's assertion that 'all chess players are artists',&lt;ref&gt;'I have come to the conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists' Marcel Duchamp. quoted [http://www.uschesstrust.org/WP/?p=496 US Chess Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017002910/http://uschesstrust.org/WP/?p=496 |date=2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas asked Saito to create a series of artworks based on chess in late 1964. The series she created relegated or removed the dominant visual aspect of the game, replacing it with sets that relied upon the honing of other senses to play. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'In Saito's chess, strategy is undermined by the physical need to utilize the five senses...by involving senses that were normally unrelated to the traditional game, Saito transformed the ultimate conceptual game into a play of sensuous interactions.' &lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p126&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As well as ''Spice Chess'', the series includes ''Sound Chess'' (different objects hidden in identical sealed boxes), ''Grinder Chess'' (a series of tactile drill bit polishers), ''Weight Chess'' (different weights hidden in sealed boxes), ''Nut &amp; Bolt Chess'' (the only known example having been lost &lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;), ''Jewel Chess'', (made from different fake jewels) and ''Smell Chess'' (different liquids in vials). All of these sets were advertised for sale in Maciunas' Fluxus shop in SoHo, March 1965.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All of these sets were mentioned in Vacuum Trapezoid #5, March 1965, but it is possible that some were never actually manufactured.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I gave all the chess sets to George, I said, 'he can use them as fluxus chess without mentioning my name." Takako Saito &lt;ref&gt;Takako Saito, quoted in Fluxus Codex, p456&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Maciunas was said to be so delighted by ''Spice Chess'' that he 'even took credit for it on occasion.' &lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p461&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later ''Fluxchess'' sets and Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set''===
Other ''Fluxchess'' sets were made by Maciunas (''Color Balls in Bottle Board Chess'', March 1966 and ''Time Chess'' made of sand timers, May 1966) and by [[Yoko Ono]], (''Pieces Hidden In Look-a-Like Containers'' intended for the Fluxfest April 1970 &lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Munroe, p136, this work 'appears not to have been realized'&lt;/ref&gt; Saito added ''Chess Board Door'' to the series in 1973, in which a chess board was to be attached to a toilet door allowing for a game to continue whilst one of the players was on the loo, and ''Liquor Chess'', 1975 (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20110528054212/http://cms.ifa.de/en/exhibitions/exhibitions-abroad/bk/fluxus/ausgewaehlte-werke/takako-saito]) in which players have to taste various different drinks to ascertain each piece's value. ''Wine Chess'' and ''Book Chess'' have been added to the series since Maciunas' death.

The most famous of these disrupted sets, Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set'' (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20081204062531/http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage Yoko Ono's Myspace] ), in which all the pieces are white on a totally white board (with a brass plaque underneath reading 'Chess Set for playing as long as you can remember where all your pieces are' &lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p128&lt;/ref&gt;) was originally made for Ono's exhibition at [[Indica Gallery]], London, 1966, and was never produced as a Fluxus edition.&lt;ref&gt;Yes, Ono &amp; Munroe, Harry N Abrams, 2000, p136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set'', in which the opponents' pieces, all white, sit on each side of an all-white board, [make] the warring factions indistinguishable from one another. This elegantly placed anti-war statement, particularly taken in the context of the Vietnam War...[draws] attention to the deeply militaristic metaphors embedded in... games by conscientiously objecting to their implicit narratives of combat and enmity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3982/is_200601/ai_n17183604/pg_10?tag=artBody;col1 Visible Language by Celia Pearce, 2006 on BNet Online], retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The piece has been reconfigured a number of times, including an edition of 20 produced by Bag Productions, UK, 1970, and as ''Play It By Trust'', a white table with ten sets and twenty white chairs laid out at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery, New York, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Yes, Ono &amp; Munroe, Harry N Abrams, 2000, p138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SmellChess-Tate.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''Smell Chess'' being played at Tate Modern, May 2008]]

===Editions===
The sets were originally sold through Maciunas' newly opened Fluxshop in unsigned, unattributed and unnumbered editions. At least one set, ''Grinder Chess'', was remade in an edition of 19 signed and numbered in 1990 as part of the ''Reflux'' editions series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oto-housebooks.com/fluxus%20&amp;%20happening.html Oto housebooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502045432/http://www.oto-housebooks.com/fluxus%20%26%20happening.html |date=2008-05-02 }} retrieved 03-10-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Hendrick's seminal ''Fluxus Codex'' was published in 1989, there was a general confusion concerning dates and authorship of the key Fluxus pieces, since few were ever sold, and even fewer were signed or dated. Saito's place within the group has gradually become more established, and the playing of ''Fluxchess'' has become an integral part of a number of recent Fluxus exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/thelongweekend2008/ Tate Modern, Long Weekend 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006204930/http://tate.org.uk/modern/thelongweekend2008/ |date=2008-10-06 }} retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; An original example of ''Spice Chess'' is one of a number of ''Fluxchess'' sets held in the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, [[Detroit]], Michigan.

The ''' ''Spiegel'' affair''' of 1962 ({{lang-de|link=no|'''Spiegel-Affäre'''}}) was a [[political scandal]] in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite news|title=A scandal rocks the young federal republic|url=http://www.dw.de/a-scandal-rocks-the-young-federal-republic/a-16295037|accessdate= 26 August 2013 |newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=10 October 2012| first1 =Michael | last1 = Marek| first2=Birgit | last2 = Görtz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stemmed from the publication of an article in ''[[Der Spiegel]],'' West Germany's weekly political magazine, about the nation's defense forces.&lt;ref name=EncycloBrit&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/766512/Spiegel-affair | first = Mona | last = Krewel | contribution = Spiegel Affair | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | date = 23 March 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The scandal involved a conflict between [[Franz Josef Strauss]], federal minister of defense, and [[Rudolf Augstein]], owner and editor-in-chief of ''Der Spiegel''.  The affair cost Strauss his office and, according to some commentators{{who|date=May 2017}}, put the postwar West German democracy to its first successful test of press freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Almut | last1 = Kipp | first2 = Benjamin | last2 = Haller | place = [[Germany|DE]] | url = http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/tv-und-medien/article109418089/Schmidt-Demokratische-Instinkte-heute-tiefer.html | language = de | title = Schmidt: ‘Demokratische Instinkte heute tiefer’ | newspaper = Hamburger Abendblatt | date = 23 September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Henry Ashby | last = Turner | title = The Two Germanies Since 1945 | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1987 | ISBN = 978-0-30003865-1 | pages = 84–86 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BvR5XGRoUp0C&amp;pg=PA84 | type = excerpt | format = Google Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032086-0037, Kanzleramt, Brandt gibt Sommerfest.jpg|thumb|[[Rudolf Augstein]] (right) in 1970 with chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F023363-0016, Empfang in der Landesvertretung, Franz Josef Strauß.jpg|thumb|125px|Strauss in 1966]]
Strauss and Augstein had clashed in 1961, when ''Spiegel'' raised accusations of [[bribery]] in favor of the [[Fibag scandal|FIBAG construction company]], which had received a contract for building military facilities. A parliamentary enquiry, however, found no evidence against Strauss.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The quarrel escalated when the 8 October 1962 issue of ''Der Spiegel'' presented an article by Conrad Ahlers, ''"Bedingt abwehrbereit"'' ("Partially Ready to Defend"), about a [[NATO]] exercise called "[[Fallex 62]]".&lt;ref name= dw/&gt;&lt;ref name=spg/&gt; The piece "included details about the performance of West Germany’s defense forces" and "a NATO commander’s assessment that found the West German forces to be only partially ready to defend the country."&lt;ref name=EncycloBrit /&gt;

The magazine was accused of [[Treason#Germany|treason]] (''Landesverrat'') "by publishing details that a hastily compiled Defense Ministry document claimed were state secrets."&lt;ref name=EncycloBrit/&gt; At 9 p.m. on 26 October, its offices in [[Hamburg]], as well as the homes of several journalists, were raided and searched by 36 policemen, who confiscated thousands of documents.&lt;ref name=spg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunkel|first=Christoph|title= 50th Anniversary of the 'Spiegel Affair': A Watershed Moment for West German Democracy |journal= Der Spiegel |date= 21 September 2012|url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/50th-anniversary-of-the-spiegel-affair-a-857030.html |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augstein and editors-in-chief Claus Jacobi and Johannes Engel were arrested.  The author of the article, Ahlers, who was vacationing in Spain, was arrested in his hotel during the night. Augstein was in custody for 103 days.  The offices remained shut for weeks.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Federal Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]] was informed of Strauss's actions. However, [[Wolfgang Stammberger]], the Minister of Justice, belonging to the smaller coalition party [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]], was deliberately left out of all decisions. News of the arrests caused riots and protest throughout West Germany. Strauss initially denied all involvement, even before the ''[[Bundestag]]'': Adenauer, in another speech, complained about an "abyss of treason" ''("Abgrund von Landesverrat")''.

Strauss was finally forced to admit that he had phoned the West German military attaché in [[Madrid]] and urged him to have Ahlers arrested.  This was clearly illegal – as Minister of the Interior [[Hermann Höcherl]] paraphrased, ''"etwas außerhalb der Legalität"'' ("somewhat outside of legality"). Since Strauss had lied to the parliament, on 19 November, the five FDP ministers of the cabinet resigned, demanding that Strauss be fired. This put Adenauer himself at risk. He found himself publicly accused of backing the suppression of a critical press with the resources of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Bernd | last1 = Oswald | first2 = Daniela | last2 = Dau | url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-affaeren-des-strauss-clans-von-gier-und-groessenwahn-1.785934 | title = Von Gier und Größenwahn | newspaper = Süddeutsche Zeitung | date = 17 May 2010 | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
On 26 November, the police ended its occupation of the ''Spiegel'' offices, while Augstein, Ahlers and three others remained under arrest – Augstein until 7 February 1963. In December 1962, Adenauer formed a new coalition with the Free Democratic Party but Strauss and Stammberger were left out of power.

On 13 May 1965, the ''[[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Bundesgerichtshof]]'' (highest German court of appeals) refused to open trial against Augstein and Ahlers,&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; ruling that during the affair Strauss had exceeded his competencies and committed ''Freiheitsberaubung'' (deprivation of personal freedom); however, because of his belief of acting lawfully (''"Verbotsirrtum"''), he was exempt from punishment.  The case also came before the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]], which issued a groundbreaking ruling in August 1966 that laid down the basics of the [[freedom of the press]] for decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Horst | last = Pöttker | url = http://www.bpb.de/apuz/140234/meilenstein-der-pressefreiheit-50-jahre-spiegel-affaere | title = Meilenstein der Pressefreiheit – 50 Jahre 'Spiegel'-Affäre | newspaper = Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte | publisher = BPB | number = 29–31 | volume = 2012 | date = 10 July 2012 | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scandal temporarily halted Strauss's political career and was remembered by many when Strauss ran for ''[[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Bundeskanzler]]'' in 1980, clearly losing against his [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] opponent (and incumbent) [[Helmut Schmidt]]. However, it is mostly remembered for altering the political culture of post-war West Germany and – with the first mass demonstrations and public protests – being a turning point from the old ''Obrigkeitsstaat'' (authoritarian state) to a modern democracy. The British historian [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian "[[deep state]]" that existed under the [[Weimar Republic]], and that the ''Spiegel'' affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian values in favour of the more democratic values that are today seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = Frederick | title = Exorcising Hitler | place = London | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | year = 2011 | page = 371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augstein became one of [[International Press Institute]]'s 50 ''Hero of World Press Freedom'' laureates in 2000 for his role in the Spiegel scandal.&lt;ref name=IPI&gt;{{Citation | place = [[Austria|AT]] | contribution-url = http://www.freemedia.at/Heroes_IPIReport2.00/02Augstein.htm | title = Laudatory submission for Hero of World Press Freedom Award | publisher = Free Media | contribution = Rudolf Augstein}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal was the closure of a reactionary period and the [[Parochialism|parochial culture]] in West Germany.&lt;ref name= ser&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Esser|first1 =Frank| first2=Uwe | last2 = Hartung |title= Nazis, Pollution, and no Sex: Political Scandals as a Reflection of Political Culture in Germany|journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year= 2004|volume= 47|issue= 1040|url= http://abs.sagepub.com/content/47/8/1040|accessdate=4 October 2013 |doi=10.1177/0002764203262277 |pages=1040–1071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movie adaption==
The Spiegel Affair was adapted into a German [[television movie]], ''Die Spiegelaffäre: Das Duell'', which was broadcast in May 2014 on [[Arte]] and [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. The film was criticized by Rudolf Augstein's daughter Franziska Augstein for containing many historical inaccuracies, in particular for inappropriately focusing on personal conflicts between Strauss and Augstein over covering the actual political and judicial conflict in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Franziska | last = Augstein | url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/medien/verfilmung-der-spiegel-affaere-das-duell-1.1943773 | title = Verfilmung der "Spiegel"-Affäre – Das Duell | newspaper = Süddeutsche Zeitung | date = 26 April 2014 | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2791404 | title = IMDb | accessdate = 12 January 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Emily Post Institute''' was created by [[etiquette]] author [[Emily Post]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Kolbert, Elizabeth. "Place Settings", ''The New Yorker''  Oct. 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Post was an American writer and socialite who became the most famous authority on how to behave graciously in society and business.  She published ''[[Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home]]'' in 1922, which was wildly popular; later updated editions were published as ''Etiquette: The Blue Book of Social Usage''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/emilypost.html Emily Post - Infoplease]&lt;/ref&gt;  Acting as a social civility barometer, EPI elucidates new manners for today's world based on the core tenets of honesty, respect, and consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emilypost.com/advice/the-principles-of-etiquette/ Principles of Etiquette]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Founded in 1946 by Emily Post and her son Ned, The Emily Post Institute, Inc. (or EPI for short), continues to promote good [[manners]] and civility in America and around the world.  Spanning five generations, this family business maintains and evolves the standards of etiquette that Emily Post established with her seminal 1922 book. Manners change over time and vary depending on location and culture. The Emily Post Institute studies this evolution. 

The organization, located in [[Burlington, Vermont]], provides etiquette experts and advice to news outlets and other corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DF1E3FF933A15757C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Enid Nemy "In an Age of Finger Food, A New Emily Post"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 20, 1997.

*Peter Post is the great-grandson of Emily Post, director of The Emily Post Institute, and author of three etiquette books.  Peter also leads business seminars in the United States and Europe.  Since 2004 Peter Post has authored a weekly "Etiquette at Work" column in ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120423034950/http://www.harpercollinsspeakersbureau.com/speaker/peter-post.aspx HarperCollins Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Real Estate Show''' was a [[Colab]] sponsored illegal occupation exhibition on the subject of landlord speculation in [[real estate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnorio.org/about/history/res_manifesto.html] ''The Real Estate Show Manifesto'' or ''Statement of Intent Committee for the Real Estate Show'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; held on New Year's Eve in January 1980 in a vacant city-owned building at 123 [[Delancey Street]] in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016. pp. 100-119&lt;/ref&gt; The squatter action followed a year of long and frustrating campaigning to rent the property for an exhibition space from officials of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD).&lt;ref&gt;Julie Ault. ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'' [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2002: p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Day the show was officially opened to the public. It was to be a two-week occupation/exhibit but was closed down by the police. On the morning of January 2, the Colab artists discovered the storefront padlocked from the inside, their work locked within. Phone calls revealed it to be the doing of HPD. ''The Real Estate Show'' had been open exactly one day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, the artists, accompanied by art dealer Ronald Feldman and German [[conceptual art]]ist [[Joseph Beuys]] assembled at the site to protest its closing in the company of reporters from the [[New York Times]], Soho News, and the [[East Village Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php]  ''The Real Estate Show'' By Lehmann Weichselbaum, [[East Village Eye]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; There was a photograph taken of Beuys at the front door of ''The Real Estate Show'' standing with Feldman, [[Alan W. Moore]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], Cid Collins and others taken that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/return-to-the-bowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php ''The Real Estate Show'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11 city workers swept into 123 Delancey, cleared out the exhibited work and trucked it to an uptown warehouse. It was not until a few days later that artists were granted entry into the warehouse to take their art back home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php] ''The Real Estate Show'' by Lehmann Weichselbaum, ''East Village Eye'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16 a deal was reached with the city that gave birth to [[ABC No Rio]] when, as a compromise, a city agency gave the artists control of nearby 156 [[Rivington Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://1981.nyc/formation-abc-no-rio/ The Formation of ABC NO RIO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Real Estate Show Revisited==
In early 2014, there were four concurrent art exhibitions in New York City around ''The Real Estate Show'': at James Fuentes Gallery, [[ABC No Rio]], the Lodge Gallery, and Cuchifritos Gallery/Essex Street Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2014/03/the-real-estate-show-revisted-at-the-james-fuentes-gallery.html] ''The Real Estate Show Revisited''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/04/a-legendary-exhibition-the-real-estate-show-has-been-revived-on-the-les/] Article on James Fuentes Gallery show "Real Estate Show, Then...And Now"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfcity.com/2014/04/08/the-real-estate-show-slideshow-and-commentary/] ''The Real Estate Show'' Slideshow and Commentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/122204/putting-the-no-in-nostalgia/] Putting the ‘No’ in ‘Nostalgia’ by [[Robert C.

In June 2017, Becky Howland &amp; Matthias Mayer curated ''The Real Estate Show'' at Spor Klubu in Berlin, drawing from documentation of the original ''Real Estate Show'' (1980) from the Archive Collection of the extant project space [[ABC No Rio]]. Included in the show were Robert Cooney, Mitch Corber, Peter Fend, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Bobby G (Robert Goldman), Ilona Granet, Becky Howland, Christof Kohlhofer, Gregory Lehmann, Ann Messner, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, Joseph Nechvatal, Cara Perlman, Scott Pfaffman, Christy Rupp and Robin Winters. In conjunction with this show, another exhibition called ''The Real Estate Show Extended/Berlin: Group exhibition on the subject of [[Gentrification]], Real Estate Speculation and Selling out the City'' was presented at Kunstpunkt Berlin. This show included many Berlin artists along with four original members of the ''Real Estate Show'' (1980): Becky Howland, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, and Joseph Nechvatal. Howland, Mönnig, Moore and Nechvatal also participated in a panel discussion on Real Estate and Art on June 3rd, 2017 that was moderated by Howard McCalebb of Dada Post, Berlin. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstpunkt.com/pages/ausstell_fr.htm] ''The Real Estate Show'' at Kunstpunkt Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">In [[game theory]], the '''traveler's dilemma''' (sometimes abbreviated '''TD''') is a type of non-[[zero-sum]] game in which two players attempt to maximize their own payoff, without any concern for the other player's payoff.

== Formulation ==
The original game scenario was formulated in 1994 by [[Kaushik Basu]] and goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaushik Basu]], "The Traveler's Dilemma: Paradoxes of Rationality in Game Theory"; ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 84, No. 2, pp. 391–395; May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaushik Basu,[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-travelers-dilemma/ "The Traveler's Dilemma"]; ''Scientific American'', June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers. Both suitcases happen to be identical and contain identical antiques. An airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains that the airline is liable for a maximum of $100 per suitcase—he is unable to find out directly the price of the antiques.''

''To determine an honest appraised value of the antiques, the manager separates both travelers so they can't confer, and asks them to write down the amount of their value at no less than $2 and no larger than $100. He also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and reimburse both travelers that amount. However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other, this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will receive that amount along with a bonus/malus: $2 extra will be paid to the traveler who wrote down the lower value and a $2 deduction will be taken from the person who wrote down the higher amount. The challenge is: what strategy should both travelers follow to decide the value they should write down?''

== Analysis ==
One might expect a traveler's optimum choice to be $100; that is, the traveler values the antiques at the airline manager's maximum allowed price. Remarkably, and, to many, counter-intuitively, the [[Nash equilibrium]] solution is in fact just $2; that is, the traveler values the antiques at the airline manager's ''minimum'' allowed price.

For an understanding of why $2 is the [[Nash equilibrium]] consider the following proof:

*Alice, having lost her antiques, is asked their value. Alice's first thought is to quote $100, the maximum permissible value.
*On reflection, though, she realizes that her fellow traveler, Bob, might also quote $100. And so Alice changes her mind, and decides to quote $99, which, if Bob quotes $100, will pay $101.
*But Bob, being in an identical position to Alice, might also think of quoting $99. And so Alice changes her mind, and decides to quote $98, which, if Bob quotes $99, will pay $100. This is greater than the $99 Alice would receive if both she and Bob quoted $99.
*This cycle of thought continues, until Alice finally decides to quote just $2—the minimum permissible price.

Another proof goes as follows:
*If Alice only wants to maximize her own payoff, choosing $99 trumps choosing $100. If Bob chooses any dollar value 2–98 inclusive, $99 and $100 give equal payoffs; if Bob chooses $99 or $100, choosing $99 nets Alice an extra dollar.
*A similar line of reasoning shows that choosing $98 is always better for Alice than choosing $99. The only situation where choosing $99 would give a higher payoff than choosing $98 is if Bob chooses $100—but if Bob is only seeking to maximize his own profit, he will always choose $99 instead of $100.
*This line of reasoning can be applied to ''all'' of Alice's whole-dollar options until she finally reaches $2, the lowest price.

== Experimental results ==
The ($2, $2) outcome in this instance is the [[Nash equilibrium]] of the game. By definition this means that if your opponent chooses this Nash equilibrium value then your best choice is that Nash equilibrium value of $2. This will not be the optimum choice if there is a chance of your opponent choosing a higher value than $2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wolpert | first1= D | year=2009 | title=Schelling Formalized: Strategic Choices of Non-Rational Personas |journal=| ssrn=1172602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the game is played experimentally, most participants select a value higher than the Nash equilibrium and closer to $100 (corresponding to the Pareto optimal solution). More precisely, the Nash equilibrium strategy solution proved to be a bad predictor of people’s behavior in a traveler's dilemma with small bonus/malus and a rather good predictor if the bonus/malus parameter was big.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capra|first=C. Monica|last2=Goeree|first2=Jacob K.|last3=Gomez|first3=Rosario|last4=Holt|first4=Charles A.|date=1999-01-01|title=Anomalous Behavior in a Traveler's Dilemma?|jstor=117040|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=3|pages=678–690|doi=10.1257/aer.89.3.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the travelers are rewarded by deviating strongly from the Nash equilibrium in the game and obtain much higher rewards than would be realized with the purely rational strategy. These experiments (and others, such as [[focal point (game theory)|focal points]]) show that the majority of people do not use purely rational strategies, but the strategies they do use are demonstrably optimal. This paradox could reduce the value of pure game theory analysis, but could also point to the benefit of an expanded reasoning that understands how it can be quite rational to make non-rational choices, at least in the context of games that have players that can be counted on to not play "rationally." For instance, Capraro has proposed a model where humans do not act a priori as single agents but they forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they act so as to maximize the forecast. His model fits the experimental data on the Traveler's dilemma and similar games quite well.&lt;ref name="Capraro"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Capraro | first1= V | year=2013  |  title=A Model of Human Cooperation in Social Dilemmas |journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 | issue=8 | pages=e72427 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072427 | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0072427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the traveler's dilemma was tested with decision undertaken in groups rather than individually, in order to test the assumption that groups decisions are more rational, delivering the message that, usually, two heads are better than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=David J|last2=Kagel|first2=John H|date=2005-06-01|title=Are Two Heads Better Than One? Team versus Individual Play in Signaling Games|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201431|journal=American Economic Review|volume=95|issue=3|pages=477–509|doi=10.1257/0002828054201431|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental findings show that groups are always more rational – i.e. their claims are closer to the Nash equilibrium - and more sensitive to the size of the bonus/malus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morone|first=A.|last2=Morone|first2=P.|last3=Germani|first3=A. R.|date=2014-04-01|title=Individual and group behaviour in the traveler's dilemma: An experimental study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804314000123|journal=Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics|volume=49|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation ==
One variation of the original traveler's dilemma in which both travelers are offered only two integer choices, $2 or $3, is identical mathematically to the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] and thus the traveler's dilemma can be viewed as an extension of prisoner's dilemma. The traveler's dilemma is also related to the game [[Guess 2/3 of the average]] in that both involve deep [[Strategic dominance#Iterated elimination of dominated strategies .28IEDS.29|iterative deletion of dominated strategies]] in order to demonstrate the Nash equilibrium, and that both lead to experimental results that deviate markedly from the [[Game theory|game-theoretical]] predictions.

In [[programming languages]], '''type erasure''' refers to the [[Loader (computing)|load-time]] process by which explicit [[Type_signature|type annotations]] are removed from a program, before it is executed at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]].  [[Operational semantics]] that do not require programs to be accompanied by types are called ''type-erasure semantics'', to be contrasted with ''type-passing semantics''.  The possibility of giving type-erasure semantics is a kind of [[Abstraction principle (computer programming)|abstraction principle]], ensuring that the run-time execution of a program does not depend on type information. In the context of [[generic programming]], the opposite of type erasure is called [[Reification (computer science)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langer|first1=Angelika|title=What is reification?|url=http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/TechnicalDetails.html#FAQ101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Type inference ==
{{Main|Type inference}}
The reverse operation is called [[type inference]]. Though type erasure can be used as an easy way to define typing over implicitly typed languages (an implicitly typed term is well-typed [[if and only if]] it is the erasure of a well-typed explicitly typed [[lambda term]]), it does not always lead to an algorithm to check implicitly typed terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6239">[[Employee]]s typically must relinquish some of their '''privacy while at the workplace''', but how much they must do so can be a contentious issue. The debate rages on as to whether it is moral, ethical and legal for employers to [[employee monitoring|monitor the actions of their employees]]. [[Employer]]s believe that monitoring is necessary both to discourage illicit activity and to limit liability. Although, with this problem of monitoring employees, many are experiencing a negative effect on [[emotional stress|emotional]] and physical stress including [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], lowered [[employee morale]] and lack of [[motivation]] within the [[workplace]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Employers might choose to monitor employee activities using [[surveillance cameras]], or may wish to record employees activities while using company owned computers or telephones. Courts are finding that disputes between workplace [[privacy]] and freedom are being complicated with the advancement of technology as traditional rules that govern areas of [[privacy law]] are debatable and becoming less important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/workplace-surveillance.htm Howstuffworks "How Workplace Surveillance Works"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/2001/10/18/sinrod.htm Electronic surveillance in the workplace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
The [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|EU Directive 95/46/EC]] on the protection of individuals with regards to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data limits and regulates the collection of personal information on individuals, including workers. Firms that monitor employees' use of e-mail, internet, or phones as part of their business practice with out notifying employees or obtaining employee consent can be, in most cases, sued under Article 8 the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Although EU law is clear that e-mail interception is illegal, the law is not totally clear as to whether companies may prohibit employees from sending private e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvia Kierkegaard|Sylvia Mercado Kierkegaard]] (2005) Reading Your Keystroke: Whose Mail Is It? [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]], Publisher: Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, Volume 3592 / 2005, Chapter: p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]] provides some privacy protections for employees.  ''See [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968#Employee Privacy|Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 § Employee Privacy]]''.   The [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] extends protections to include email messages, cell phones and other electronic communications.  ''See [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act#Employee Privacy|Electronic Communications Privacy Act § Employee Privacy]]''.

A 2005 survey of more than 500 U.S. companies found that over half of employers had disciplined employees and about one in four had terminated (fired) an employee for "inappropriate" use of the internet, such as sending an inappropriate email message to a client or supervisor, neglecting work while [[instant messaging|chatting]] with friends, or viewing pornography during work hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5697883 Surfing the Web on the Company Dime : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tools that are used for [[electronic surveillance]] are often caching [[proxy server]]s that are also used for [[Computer and network surveillance|web monitoring]].

==Canada==
{{further|Canadian privacy law}}
In ''[[R v Cole]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makin|first1=Kirk|title=Supreme Court rules employees have right to privacy on work computers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-employees-have-right-to-privacy-on-work-computers/article4625660/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that {{quote|Computers that are reasonably used for personal purposes — whether found in the workplace or the home — contain information that is meaningful, intimate, and touching on the user’s biographical core.  Canadians may therefore reasonably expect privacy in the information contained on these computers, at least where personal use is permitted or reasonably expected.|source={{lexum-scc|2012|53}}}}

== Economic theory ==
According to the [[Coase theorem|Coase Theorem]], an employer and an employee never agree to a contractual arrangement that would reduce the total surplus generated by the two parties together. Hence, when we observe workplace surveillance, then the costs (say, the worker’s disutility caused by the loss of privacy) must be smaller than the benefit (say, the additional profit due to a reduction of shirking), because otherwise the parties would abolish surveillance (the worker would be willing to accept a smaller wage in exchange for more privacy, which would increase the employer’s profit more than surveillance could do). However, the Coase Theorem holds only if there are no [[Transaction cost|transaction costs]]. Schmitz (2005) has shown that in the presence of asymmetric information (leading to a [[moral hazard]] problem), the total surplus generated by an employer and an employee can be increased if workplace surveillance is prohibited by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2005|title=Workplace surveillance, privacy protection, and efficiency wages|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|journal=Labour Economics|volume=12|issue=6|pages=727–738|doi=10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|issn=0927-5371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
