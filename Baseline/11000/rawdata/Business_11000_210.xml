'''Abbott Laboratories''' is an [[United States|American]] [[health care]] company with headquarters in [[Lake Bluff]], [[Illinois]], United States. The company was founded by Chicago [[physician]] Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products.  It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into [[AbbVie]] in 2013.  In 2017, revenues were $27.39 billion.

Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health.  In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.

Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the [[emergency department]].

In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], founded the '''Abbott Alkaloidal Company''' in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a [[Herbalism|medicinal plant]], generally an [[alkaloid]] (e.g., [[morphine]], [[quinine]], [[strychnine]] and [[codeine]]), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Abbott-Laboratories-Company-History.html |title=Abbott Laboratories Company History |publisher=Funding Universe |date= |accessdate= April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 he moved the company from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.

Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in [[Pakistan]] as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in [[Karachi]] continue to produce pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com.pk/11_Aboutus.htm|title=About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it merged with Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, and Richard Ross gained a seat on Abbott's board of directors until his retirement in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-12-11/news/9312110107_1_abbott-laboratories-mr-ross-columbus&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in [[India]] for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently [[India]]'s largest healthcare products company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/abbott-india-and-the-extraordinary-future-it-is-building/1/215073.html|title=It's essential to be part of the extraordinary future India is building: Miles D. White|work=intoday.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Harvard professor [[Lester Grinspoon]] and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".&lt;ref name="grinspoon23"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grinspoon|first1=Lester|last2=Hedblom|first2=Peter|title=The Speed Culture: Amphetamine Use and Abuse in America|date=1975|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674831926|oclc=1362148|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LyStWcRD6QIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=strasenburgh+prescription#v=onepage&amp;q=strasenburgh%20prescription&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of [[BASF]]. In 2002, it divested the [[Selsun Blue]] brand to [[Chattem]]. Later in 2002, the company sold [[Clear Eyes]] and [[Murine]] to [[Prestige Brands]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named [[Hospira]], and acquired TheraSense, a [[diabetes]]-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted [[Boston Scientific]] in its purchase of [[Guidant]] Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.

In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed [[Niaspan]], which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and [[Advicor]], a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.

In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to [[General Electric]] for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the [[GE Healthcare]] business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Layne | first=Rachel | last2=Lopatto | first2=Elizabeth | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aLKvFFqD3DQw | title=GE, Abbott End $8.13 Billion Diagnostic Sale Deal (Update2) | agency=Bloomberg News | date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at [[Queenborough]] to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of [[Advanced Medical Optics]] based in [[Santa Ana, California]]. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at [[Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of [[Solvay S.A.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com/news-media/press-releases/Press_Release_0819.htm |title=Abbott Completes Acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals |author=Abbott Press Release |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312235321/http://www.abbott.com/news-media/press-releases/Press_Release_0819.htm |archivedate=12 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.&lt;ref name="Abbott-Feb-2010-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/205/0001104659-10-007120.pdf |title=Abbott Laboratories Feb 2010 Current Report, Form 8-K, Filing Date Feb 16, 2010 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Dec 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a [[Hollywood, Florida]]-based [[Laboratory information management system|LIMS]] company [[STARLIMS]]. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com/news-media/press-releases/Press_Release_0834.htm |title=Abbott Completes Acquisition of STARLIMS Technologies |author=Abbott Press Release |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=March 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016231410/http://www.abbott.com/news-media/press-releases/Press_Release_0834.htm |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2&lt;ref&gt;Abbott 2011 annual report, p43&lt;/ref&gt; billion to become the biggest drug company in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com/news-media/press-releases/Press_Release_0861.htm |title=Abbott  to Become No. 1 Pharmaceutical Company in India with Acquisition of Piramal's Healthcare Solutions Business |author=Abbott Press Release |date=May 21, 2010 |accessdate=March 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324191912/http://www.abbott.com/news-media/press-releases/Press_Release_0861.htm |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abbott Labs to Split Into 2 Companies|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/abbott-to-split-into-two/?_r=0|work=New York Times Dealbook|date=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rockoff|first1=Jonathan D.|title=Abbott to Split Into Two Companies|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204485304576640740820288766|work=Wall Street Journal|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company announced that the other company would be named  [[AbbVie]] in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schorsch|first1=Kristen|title=Abbott picks name for spinoff pharmaceutical company|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120321/NEWS03/120329957/abbott-picks-name-for-spinoff-pharmaceutical-company|work=Crain's Chicago Business|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.&lt;ref name=frost2012&gt;{{Citation |author= Frost, Peter |publication-date=October 17, 2012 |title=Abbott lays off 550 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-abbott-lays-off-550-20121017,0,4039023.story |accessdate=November 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013.

On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the [[holding company]] Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, [[CFR Pharmaceuticals]], which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-16/abbott-agrees-to-purchase-chile-s-cfr-pharmaceuticals.html |title=Abbott to acquire CFR Pharmaceuticals|author=Bloomberg Release|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Abbott Grows Branded Generics with $3.3B CFR Acquisition|last=Staff|first=|date=15 June 2014|work=[[Gen.

In June 2014, the company entered into ''a definitive agreement'' to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm ([[Voronezh]]) in a deal worth $631 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ABT/key-developments|title=Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  Key Developments&amp;nbsp;— Reuters.com|work=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire [[Alere]] for $5.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/abbott-to-acquire-alere-for-5-8b/81252306/|title=Abbott to Acquire Alere for $5.8B|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-01/abbott-to-buy-medical-diagnostics-maker-alere-for-56-a-share|title=Abbott's $5.8 Billion Deal for Alere Is Device Sector's Latest|author=Michelle Cortez|date=1 February 2016|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire [[St. Jude Medical]] for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash &amp; 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/abbott-agrees-to-buy-st-jude-medical-for-25-billion|title=Abbott to Buy St. Jude Medical in Deal Valued at About $25 Billion|author=Michelle Cortez|date=28 April 2016|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-04-28/abbott-st-jude-combination-why-it-makes-sense|title=Abbott-St. Jude Combination: Why It Makes Sense|date=28 April 2016|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management practices==
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} ''[[DiversityInc]]'' magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Litigation==

===Humira===
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" ([[Adalimumab]]) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=af.37juYEPaQ |title=Cambridge Antibody Wins Lawsuit Against Abbott Labs (Update5) - Bloomberg |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)]] (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Depakote===

On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of [[Depakote]] for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.&lt;ref name="doj"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/May/12-civ-585.html Abbott Labs to Pay $1.5 Billion to Resolve Criminal &amp; Civil Investigations of Off-label Promotion of Depakote], Press Release, [[United States Department of Justice]] Office of Public Affairs, May 7, 2012. Accessed Aug. 17 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty&lt;ref&gt;U.S. ex rel. McCoyd v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:07-cv-00081 (W.D. Va.); U.S. ex rel. Mulcahy v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:08-cv-0054 (W.D. Va.); U.S. ex rel. Dietzler v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:09-cv-00051 (W.D. Va.); U.S. ex rel. Spetter v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:10-cv-00006 (W.D. Va.).&lt;/ref&gt; The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/516296/abbott-shareholders-agree-to-settle-depakote-marketing-suit |title=Abbott, Shareholders Agree To Settle Depakote Marketing Suit - Law360 |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship==

'''Abuja Stock Exchange''' (ASE) was set up in 2000 and went live in 2001. It was the first [[stock exchange|exchange]] in [[Nigeria]] to provide [[electronic trading]], clearing and Settlement for both the [[primary market]] as well as [[secondary market]]s. It was set up to trade in equities, unlisted stocks and plain vanilla bonds.

Soon after its launch a government notification forced it to close its operations. This was orchestrated by the more powerful [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]] which lobbied with the government to maintain its monopoly over the Nigerian stock markets. The reasoning for the notification was that there was no need for a second stock exchange in the country.

However, efforts are currently on to convert the existing infrastructure into a multicommodity exchange [[commodities exchange]].

'''Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.''' is an American pharmaceutical company best known for its development of [[Eculizumab|Soliris]], a drug used to treat the rare disorders [[atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome]] (aHUS) and [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (PNH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/221849.php|title=Alexion Submits Application for Soliris|date=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/companies/alexion-pharmaceuticals/ |title=Alexion Pharmaceuticals on the Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies List|work=forbes.com|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is also involved in immune system research related to autoimmune diseases.  It employs 2,794 people worldwide.&lt;ref name=NumHub&gt;{{cite web |url=https://numhub.co/stats/28402-alexion-pharmaceuticals-inc/28715-number-of-employees |title=Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. number of employees |work=numhub.co |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the company held the dedication ceremony for its new headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut, not far from the company's starting point in the same city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos.newhavenregister.com/2016/02/29/photos-of-alexion-pharmaceuticals-global-hq-dedication/#1|title=Photos of Alexion Pharmaceuticals World HQ Dedication|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Alexion announced it would be moving its headquarters to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in mid-2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Singer |first=Stephen |url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-alexion-moving-new-haven-boston-20170911-story.html |title=Alexion Exits New Haven For Boston, Agrees To Repay Millions In State Aid |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |date=2017-09-12 |accessdate=2017-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at [[Science Park]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] by Steven Squinto and Leonard Bell.&lt;ref name=medpage /&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/09/05/how-a-440000-drug-is-turning-alexion-into-biotechs-new-innovation-powerhouse/#d3819ca25e11|title=How A $440,000 Drug Is Turning Alexion Into Biotech's New Innovation Powerhouse|last=Herper|first=Matthew|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell served as the company's CEO until 2015.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt; In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to [[Cheshire, Connecticut]]. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015.

Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of healthcare research and quality studies at [[Duke University]] for aspirin and [[Clopidogrel]] (trade name '''Plavix''').&lt;ref name=medpage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Cardiology/PCI/4638 |title= More Support for Long-Term Plavix to Improve Stent Safety |date=Dec 5, 2006 |accessdate=Jul 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexion received U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]], a rare blood disorder.&lt;ref name=Everything&gt;{{cite news|title=Everything you need to know about the $8.4B acquisition of Synageva|author=Don Seiffert|work=Boston Business Journal|date=May 6, 2015|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/bioflash/2015/05/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-8-4b.html|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, there was an outbreak of [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] caused by [[Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli|Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli]] (EHEC) in Germany.  Soliris was considered a treatment option because of its effectiveness in treating [[Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome]], an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/news18747.html|title=Alexion treating Europe's E coli victims|date=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Alexion was added to the [[NASDAQ-100]], a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the [[NASDAQ]]; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced [[Genzyme|Genzyme Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.nasdaqomx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=560664|title=Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Join the NASDAQ-100 Index Beginning April 4, 2011|date=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt; In 2016, the company became a member of the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/teva-wins-controversial-phrma-bid-despite-protests-from-branded-rivals|title=Teva wins controversial PhRMA bid despite protests from branded rivals - FiercePharma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. David Brennan, a current board member, became interim CEO. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of [[Honeywell]], was appointed CFO, replacing Vikas Sinha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://news.alexionpharma.com/press-release/company-news/alexions-board-directors-announces-new-leadership-appointments|title=Alexion’s Board of Directors Announces New Leadership Appointments {{!}} Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc|website=news.alexionpharma.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Alexion named [[Ludwig N. Hantson]] as its new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grover |first=Natalie |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alexion-pharms-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16Y157 |title=Alexion Pharma names former Baxalta chief Ludwig Hantson CEO |agency=Reuters |date=March 27, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Alexion announced that it would be closing its Smithfield, RI manufacturing facility.

===Acquisitions===
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a [[San Diego, California]]-based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition.  At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.alexionpharm.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1005477-00-8099|title=Alexion Buys Calif.

In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp, the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder [[hypophosphatasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-29/alexion-to-pay-as-much-as-1-08-billion-to-buy-enobia-pharma.html|title=Alexion to Pay as Much as $1.08 Billion to Buy Enobia Pharma|date=December 29, 2011 |newspaper=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm [[Synageva BioPharma]], a maker of rare disease treatments, in a $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe_2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Genzyme became a source of biotech executives |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/07/11/genzyme-family-tree-how-henri-termeer-spawned-network-genzyme-alums-leading-dozens-biotechs-from-cambridge-stockholm/Dkoz2zcLlNz3N6OZbOvN4L/story.html# |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=12 July 2015 |accessdate=17 July 2015 |author=Robert Weisman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt; It also represented a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexion Puts Its Soaring Stock Price to Good Use|date=May 6, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/business/dealbook/alexion-puts-its-soaring-stock-price-to-good-use.html|accessdate=May 7, 2015|work=The New York Times|author=Robert Cyran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Alexion announced the acquisition of [[Wilson Therapeutics]] for $855 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wilson-therapeut-m-a-alexion-pharms/biotech-ma-rolls-on-as-alexion-snaps-up-wilson-for-855-million-idUSKBN1HI236|title=Biotech M&amp;A rolls on as Alexion snaps up Wilson for $855 million|last=Hirschler|first=Ben|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/alexion-to-acquire-wilson-therapeutics-for-855m/81255689|title=Alexion to Acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855M - GEN|author=|date=|website=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September the company announced it was to acquire [[Syntimmune]] for $1.2 billion - expanding its rare disease offering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/alexion-to-acquire-syntimmune-for-up-to-12b-expanding-rare-disease-pipeline/81256274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-syntimmune-m-a-alexion-pharms/alexion-to-buy-biotech-firm-syntimmune-for-up-to-1-2-billion-idUKKCN1M61DU&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 Alexion Pharmaceuticals shares are mainly held by institutional investors ([[Fidelity Investments]], [[T. Rowe Price]], [[BlackRock]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/alxn/ownership-summary|title=Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

==Products==

===Specialty drugs===
{{main|Specialty drugs}}
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases.  Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker{{vague|Quicker in what way? Quicker to research? Clinical trials? Quicker to develop? To market?|date=June 2018}} and cheaper than those for mass market drugs.  Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion.  Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies' outlays.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."&lt;ref name="Forbes_2010" /&gt;

====Soliris====
{{main|Eculizumab}}
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, first launched in 2007,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; used to treat the rare disorders [[atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome]] (aHUS) and [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (PNH).&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;  It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited.  In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/50969/Alexion+Seeks+Label+Expansion|title=Alexion Seeks Label Expansion|date=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.&lt;ref name=Everything /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt; The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.&lt;ref name="CBC_2015"&gt;{{citation  |title=A Price to Pay: how the manufacturer pulls on emotions - patients, families, politicians and governments around the world |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-pharmaceutical-company-alexion-set-the-price-of-the-world-s-most-expensive-drug-1.3125251 |author=Kelly Crowe, |publisher=CBC News |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome#Atypical cases|atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] in both adults and children.  More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation.  The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110923005612/en/Soliris%C2%AE-eculizumab-Approved-FDA-Patients-Atypical-Hemolytic|title=Soliris® (eculizumab) Approved by FDA for All Patients with Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.&lt;ref name="Forbes_2010"&gt;{{citation |title=The World's Most Expensive Drugs |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/19/expensive-drugs-cost-business-healthcare-rare-diseases.html |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2015 |first=Matthew |last=Herper |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/doctors-must-tell-patients-of-errors-under-new-law-from-varadkar-1.2092525|title=Doctors must tell patients of errors, under new Varadkar law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nice.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/high-cost-of-treatment-for-rare-blood-disorder-needs-to-be-clarified-says-nice-in-draft-guidance|title=High cost of treatment for rare blood disorder needs to be clarified, says NICE in draft guidance|author=|date=|website=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $500,000 a year in Canada.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nice.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallant_2014" /&gt; and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).&lt;ref name="Forbes_2010" /&gt; In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for [[rheumatoid arthritis]], which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.&lt;ref name="Gallant_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/12/04/toronto_woman_with_rare_disease_fights_province_for_lifesaving_but_costly_drug.html |title=Toronto woman with rare disease fights province for life-saving but costly drug Soliris, which costs $500,000 a year, would treat Toni Vernon's blood disease, but the health ministry is holding back |first=Jacques |last=Gallant|date=December 4, 2014 |accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive.  The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/1.1617223|title=Viktor (7) moet elke twee weken infuus krijgen van 9.000 euro|date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 4, 2013, ''[[De Standaard]]'' reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/DMF20130504_00566977|title=Pr-bureau van farmabedrijf adviseerde ook ouders Viktor|date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/130504_Alexion_Viktor|title=Farmabedrijf Alexion heeft Viktor "gebruikt"|date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/DMF20130506_00568721|title=Farmabaas fluit Alexion terug in zaak-Viktor|date=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/1.1619457 |title=Detiège: "Dit is chantage van het farmabedrijf"|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/DMF20130507_00570744|title=Medicijn Viktor vanaf juli terugbetaald|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dm20150323" /&gt;

Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court [[gag order]] against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20131001_00768977  |title= Spreekverbod Pharma.be opgeheven|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=2015-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the case was still pending in March 2015.&lt;ref name="dm20150323"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.demorgen.be/binnenland/-contract-van-onkelinx-met-farmareus-opent-doos-van-pandora-a2261432/ |title= Contract van Onkelinx met farmareus opent doos van Pandora |date= 2015-03-23|accessdate=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 the FDA approved the use of Soliris to treat adult patients with generalized [[myasthenia gravis]] (gMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/14356628/1/alexion-pharmaceuticals-stock-jumps-on-fda-approval-of.html|title=Alexion Pharmaceuticals Stock Jumps on FDA Approval of Soliris|last=Bruno|first=Giovanni|date=2017-10-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017 the company received a patent for Soliris from the [[Japan Patent Office|Japanese Patent Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Alexion+Pharma+(ALXN)+Receives+New+Japanese+Patent+for+Soliris/13466411.html|title=Alexion Pharma (ALXN) Receives New Japanese Patent for Soliris|work=StreetInsider.com|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strensiq====

In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq ([[asfotase alfa]]), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat [[hypophosphatasia]], a rare metabolic disorder.

[[Kanuma (drug)|Kanuma]], which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat [[lysosomal acid lipase deficiency]], a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;  Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Biotech blastoff: Synageva up 112% on $8B Alexion deal|agency=AP|author=Tom Murphy|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/05/06/alexion-synageva/70909976/|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financials==
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%.  Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price  related to rebates in Europe.  Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.alexionpharm.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=899866-14-34|title=Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Annual Report|author=|date=|website=ir.alexionpharm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;   R&amp;D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.&lt;ref name=medpage /&gt;

When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;  However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million.  Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexion to Buy Synageva for $8.4 Billion|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 6, 2015|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/alexion-to-buy-synageva-in-8-4-billion-biotech-deal-1430911447|accessdate=May 7, 2015|author=Chelsey Dulaney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;  The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings.  Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In the 1990s, a '''trade dispute''' over fresh [[salmon]] arose between [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In 1995, Canada made a complaint to the [[World Trade Organization]], of which both countries are members, about Australia's restriction on imports of fresh salmon, which were part of a [[quarantine]] measure for health purposes.

[[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|WTO dispute resolution]] favored Canada, both in a 1997 panel decision and in a subsequent decision by the WTO [[Appellate Body]]. The WTO determined that the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] (SPS Agreement) did not allow Australia's import ban. The WTO ordered Australia to lift its ban and increased quarantine requirements not only for salmon, but for imports of other species of fish as well.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia - Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon|url=http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/international-organisations/wto/wto-dispute-settlement/Pages/australia-measures-affecting-importation-of-salmon-wt-ds18.aspx|website=dfat.gov.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parties settled their dispute in 2000.

==Salmon industry and origins of the dispute==
In the 1990s, major world salmon exporters include Canada, Norway, Chile, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Michael Richardson, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fish.t_0.html Ottawa Sees Protectionism by Canberra; Canada's Beef: Salmon], ''New York Times'', November 10, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Australia had a 100 million [[Australian dollar|AUD]] (75.1 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) salmon industry, with a total value of Australian salmon exports (mostly to east Asia, particularly Japan) of about 40 million dollars.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

In 1975, Australia imposed a ban on imports of fresh salmon under a quarantine regulation intended to prevent entry of imported diseases into fish stock in Australia.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt; Australia did allow imports of non-fresh salmon, including salmon that had been heat-treated by [[canning]] (see [[salmon cannery]]) or [[smoking]], which reduces the risk of disease. In 1995, the annual value of such imports to Australia was about 52 million dollars, with almost half of these imports coming from Canada.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt; Australian salmon had an advantage in Japanese and other markets, selling for premiums up to 20 percent over other imported fresh salmon, because of Australian environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

In the 1990s, however, tensions arose between Canada and Australia over Australia's regulation, negatively affecting the [[Australia–Canada relations|two countries' relations]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt; The Australians argued that the ban was justified on health grounds; the Canadians argued that there was no scientific evidence that Canadian fresh-salmon imports would be unsafe and that the ban was simply [[protectionism]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

[[File:Salmon for sale.JPG|thumb|Salmon for sale at a fish market.]]

==WTO case and settlement==
In the 1990s, Canada brought a dispute to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTC) against Australia regarding the importation of salmon. The official title of the case was '''Australia — Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon''', Dispute DS18.&lt;ref name="WTO"&gt;[https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds18_e.htm Dispute Settlement: Dispute DS18: Australia — Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon], World Trade Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was the first challenged under the 1994 Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) reached following the 1994 [[Uruguay Round]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

The case formally began with Canada's request for consultations on October 1995.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Canada alleged that Australia's prohibition on Canadian salmon imports under the Australian quarantine regulation was inconsistent with the SPS Agreement and articles XI and XIII of the 1994 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

Following requests from Canada to establish a panel, the DSB did so in April 1997.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The [[European Communities]], [[India]], [[Norway]], and the [[United States]] reserved their third-party rights.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The panel was composed in May 1997, and the panel report circulated in June 1998.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The panel determined that Australia's important ban was "inconsistent with Articles 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6 of the SPS Agreement, and also nullified or impaired benefits accruing to Canada under the SPS Agreement."&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

In June 1998, Australia filed a notice of its intention to appeal the panel's decision to the WTO [[Appellate Body]].&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Appellate Body report circulated in October 1998.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Appellate Body reversed the panel with respect to its reasoning on Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement, but found that Australia "had acted inconsistently" with those sections.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Appellate Body also broadened the panel's determination that Australia had acted inconsistently with Articles 5.5 and 2.3 of the SPS Agreement.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Finally the Appellate Body "reversed the panel's finding that Australia had acted inconsistently with Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement but was unable to come to a conclusion whether or not Australia's measure was consistent with Article 5.6 due to insufficient factual findings by the panel."&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;  The decision directed Australia not only to lift the ban on Canadian salmon, but also the quarantine requirements for several other species of fish.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;

The DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report in November 1998.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;  Australia expressed its intention to abide by the DSB's decision.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

In December 1998, Canada requested arbitration under to Article 21.3(c) of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) "to determine the reasonable period of time for implementation of the recommendations of the DSB."&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Article 21.3(c) Arbitration Report was circulated in February 1999; it determined that the reasonable period of time for implementation was eight months (i.e., the period ending on July 6, 1999).&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

After Canada brought this dispute to the WTO, Australia published the "1999 Import Risk Analysis" arguing that the import of frozen, fresh or chilled salmon is a health risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia-Salmon|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds18sum_e.pdf|website=wto.org|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Canada made requests under the DSU for a determination by the original panel of whether the implementation measures taken by Australia were consistent with WTO rules as determined in the dispute-resolution proceedings.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; At its meeting of July 28, 1999, the DSB agreed to take up Canada's request and referred the matter back to the original panel. The EC, Norway and the U.S. again reserved their third-party rights.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

The compliance panel was composed in September 1999 and circulated its report in February 2000, finding:&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

{{quote|

*Due to delays in the entry into force of several implementing measures which extended beyond the reasonable period of time within which Australia had to implement the DSB recommendations, no measures to comply existed in the sense of Article 21.5 of the DSU in respect of a number of covered products and during specific periods of time. As a result, during those periods, Australia failed to bring its measure into conformity with the SPS Agreement in the sense referred to in Article 22.6 of the DSU.
*Australia, by requiring that only salmon product that is "consumer-ready" as specifically defined can be imported into Australia and released from quarantine, was maintaining sanitary measures that were not "based on" a risk assessment, which was contrary to Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement. The panel also considered the same requirement to be in violation of Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement.
*Finally, the panel found that Australia violated Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement as a result of a measure enacted by the Government of Tasmania that effectively prohibits the importation of certain Canadian salmon product into most parts of Tasmania without being based on a risk assessment and without sufficient scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;}}

The DSB adopted the report of the compliance panel in March 2000.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

In July 1999, before compliance proceedings began, Canada requested authorization from the DSB, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU, to suspend concessions to Australia because of its non-compliance.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Australia objected to Canada's proposed level of suspension of concessions and requested that the matter be referred to arbitration, pursuant to Article 22.6.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The DSB agreed to this request, but the arbitration proceedings were suspended until after the compliance proceedings concluded.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

At the DSB meeting of May 18, 2000, following the compliance panel's decision, and following discussion between the WTO and the governments of the two countries, sectors of each government and the panel, Canada announced that it had come to an agreement with Australia to bring the dispute to a close.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The parties exchanged letters detailing the agreement.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Under the agreement, "Canada would monitor closely Australia's commitment to implement the agreement" by June 1, 2000.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The agreement became effective on schedule on June 1, 2000.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;

==Countries ==

=== Canada ===

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA) verifies that exported foods and food products meet the Canadian standards just as an importing country would. Countries have their own requirements for foods and food products and the Canadian government understands this and respects those requirements.&lt;ref name=CFIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Exports|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/exports/eng/1323723342834/1323723662195|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has implemented the fish inspection act to help regulate the export of fish and fish products.&lt;ref name="Fish Export Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fish Export Policy|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/fish-and-seafood/exports/policy/eng/1329762426884/1329762515816|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts Canada has put towards achieving a substantial export in their fish (salmon) shows speculation towards Australia.

=== Australia ===

[[Aquaculture in Australia]] is the country's fastest growing [[primary industry]] accounting for 34% of the countries seafood production. Salmon is a part of this movement across the country with Atlantic salmon becoming a mainstream fish produced through the aquaculture systems. Salmon farms are found in [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]] and while they are making an effort to improve [[salmon farming]] offshore and inshore it is still producing a small amount of salmon for Australia.

Although the countries were developing a negative trade relationship, Australia values its long-standing close and productive relationship with Canada. Their trade relationship dates back over 100 years and the two countries continuously work together. Australian and Canadian military forces fought side by side in both World Wars, The Korean War and the 1990-91 Gulf War. Both countries have forces in Afghanistan making movements to stabilize that country as close military allies.&lt;ref name="Australia-Canada Relations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia-Canada relations|url=http://www.canada.embassy.gov.au/otwa/relations.html|website=www.canada.embassy.gov.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Castillo v. Case Farms of Ohio''''',  96 F Supp. 2d 578, is a case involving poor working conditions for migratory workers.  It established that an [[Agency (law)|principal / agent]] relationship existed between Case Farms and America's Tempcorps (ATC) that allowed Case Farms to be liable for its agent's actions.

==Facts==
[[Migrant workers|Migrant farm workers]] were recruited in Texas by America's Tempcorps to work in Case Farm's [[Ohio]]-based chicken processing plant.  They were given a bus ticket and $20 for three days of food. Upon arriving they found themselves living in conditions called "distressing and deplorable" by the court.  The employees were packed in to unfurnished rooms infested with cockroaches and rats.  The workers slept on the floor and were transported in an overcrowded van.

==Issue==
The working conditions were largely not refuted.  At issue was 1) whether or not American's Tempcorps (ATC) was an agent of Case Farms, and 2) if agency existed, whether that agency make Case Farms liable for ATC’s actions.

==Complaint==
The plaintiffs alleged:
*Violations of the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act]] (AWPA)
*Violations of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]
*[[Breach of Contract]]
*[[Fraud]]
*[[Negligence|Negligent]] Misrepresentation

==Plaintiff’s Argument==  
Castillo argued that agency relationship existed between ATC and Case Farms, and the scope of that relationship included both the [[Agency (law)|express authority]] to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ plant, and the [[Agency (law)|implied authority]] to do all things proper, usual and necessary to exercise that authority.

==Defendant’s Argument==  
Case Farms argued, to the extent that an agency relationship existed, the scope of that agency was limited solely to informing recruits about the availability of work at Case Farms’ processing plant.  They also contended that the workers recruited by ATC were not full-fledged Case Farms workers (despite the fact that the work, pay rates, and supervision of these workers were essentially identical to Case Farms employees.)

== The Court's Analysis ==   
1) A principal may be liable for the acts of a purported agent based on an actual agency relationship created by the principal’s express or implied delegation of authority to the agent.

2) A principal is liable only if those actions are taken in the scope of the agent’s employment.
Express actual authority exists “where the principal has made it clear to the agent that he wants the act under scrutiny to be done.”

3) Giving an agent express authority to undertake a certain act also includes the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise that express authority.

The evidence at trial supported the contention that Case Farms expressly authorized ATC to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ Ohio plant, and that such an express agency existed with the scope of recruiting and hiring migrant workers.
The evidence also supported the contention that the housing and transportation activities were well within the agents implied authority—based on Case Farms’ unique recruiting challenges, the great distances the migrant workers sought were required to travel, and Case Farms outsourcing of this difficult recruiting task to ATC.

== Holding ==   
America's Tempcorps was an agent of Case Farms, ATC’s actions were attributable to Case Farms for the purpose of assessing compliance with the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act|AWPA]], and Case Farms was liable for ATC’s actions..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9655">'''Decision-making software''' ('''DM software''') is a term for computer applications that help individuals and organisations make choices and take decisions, typically by ranking, prioritizing or choosing from a number of options.

An early example of DM software was described in 1973.&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, JS (1973), "A time-sharing computer program for the solution of the multiple criteria problem", ''Management Science'', 19: 1379-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal"&gt;Wallenius, J, Dyer, JS, Fishburn, PC, Steuer, RE, Zionts, S and Deb, K (1992), "Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: The next ten years", ''Management Science'', 38: 645-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], most DM software was spreadsheet-based,&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal" /&gt; with the first web-based DM software appearing in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Koksalanetal"&gt;Koksalan, M, Wallenius, J, and Zionts, S, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century'', World Scientific Publishing: Singapore, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, many DM software products (mostly web-based) are available&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal"&gt;Weistroffer, HR, and Li, Y, "Multiple criteria decision analysis software", Ch 29 in: Greco, S, Ehrgott, M and Figueira, J, eds, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys Series'', Springer: New York, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orms"&gt;Oleson, S (2016), [http://www.orms-today.org/surveys/das/das.html "Decision analysis software survey"], ''OR/MS Today'' 43(5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishizaka"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781118644898| title = Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis| year = 2013| last1 = Ishizaka | first1 = A. | last2 = Nemery | first2 = P. | isbn = 9781118644898}}&lt;/ref&gt; – e.g. see the comparison table below.

Most DM software focuses on ranking, prioritizing or choosing from among alternatives characterized on multiple criteria or attributes.&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; Thus most DM software is based on [[decision analysis]], usually [[multi-criteria decision-making]], and so is often referred to as "decision analysis"&lt;ref name="orms" /&gt; or "multi-criteria decision-making"&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; software – commonly shortened to "decision-making software". Some [[decision support systems]] include a DM software component.

==Purpose==
DM software can assist decision-makers “at various stages of the decision-making process, including problem exploration and formulation, identification of decision alternatives and solution constraints, structuring of preferences, and tradeoff judgements.”&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt;

The purpose of DM software is to support the analysis involved at these various stages of the decision-making process, not to replace it. DM software "should be used to support the process, not as the driving or dominating force."&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart"&gt;Belton, V, and Stewart, TJ, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: An Integrated Approach'', Kluwer: Boston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

DM software frees users "from the technical implementation details [of the decision-making method employed], allowing them to focus on the fundamental value judgements".&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt; Nonetheless, DM software should not be employed blindly. "Before using a software, it is necessary to have a sound knowledge of the adopted methodology and of the decision problem at hand."&lt;ref name="Figueiraetal"&gt;Figueira, J, Greco, S and Ehrgott, M, "Introduction", Ch 1 in: Figueira, J, Greco, S and Ehrgott, M, eds, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys Series'', Springer: New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and features==

===Decision-making methods===
As mentioned earlier, most DM software is based on [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM). MCDM involves evaluating and combining alternatives' characteristics on two or more criteria or attributes in order to rank, prioritize or choose from among the alternatives.&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal2008"&gt;Wallenius, J, Dyer, JS, Fishburn, PC, Steuer, RE, Zionts, S and Deb, K (2008), "Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: Recent accomplishments and what lies ahead", ''Management Science'' 54: 1336-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

DM software employs a variety of MCDM methods;&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt; popular examples include:
* [[Aggregated Indices Randomization Method]] (AIRM)
* [[Analytic Hierarchy Process]] (AHP)
* [[Analytic network process]] (ANP, an extension of AHP)
* [[ELECTRE|Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality]] (ELECTRE)
* [[Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH)]]
* [[Multi-attribute global inference of quality]] (MAGIQ)
* [[Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives]] (PAPRIKA)
* [[Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation]] (PROMETHEE)
* [[Evidential reasoning approach]] for MCDM under hybrid uncertainty

There are significant differences between these methods&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal2008" /&gt; and, accordingly, the DM software implementing them. Such differences include:
:# The extent to which the decision problem is broken into a [[hierarchy]] of sub-problems;
:# Whether or not [[pairwise comparisons]] of alternatives and/or criteria are used to elicit decision-makers' preferences;
:# The use of [[interval scale]] or [[ratio scale]] measurements of decision-makers' preferences;
:# The number of criteria included;
:# The number of alternatives evaluated, ranging from a few (finite) to infinite;
:# The extent to which numerical scores are used to value and/or rank alternatives;
:# The extent to which incomplete rankings (relative to complete rankings) of alternatives are produced;
:# The extent to which uncertainty is modeled and analyzed.

===Software features===
In the process of helping decision-makers to rank, prioritize or choose from among alternatives, DM software products often include a variety of features and tools;&lt;ref name="Koksalanetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; common examples include:
*[[Pairwise comparison]]
*[[Sensitivity analysis]]
*Group evaluation (teamwork)
*Web-based implementation

===Comparison of decision-making software===
DM software includes the following notable examples.

&lt;!--Bishop, Mr. Dickinson H. "Dick"--&gt;
'''Dickinson H. Bishop''' (March 24, 1887&amp;nbsp;– February 16, 1961) was an American businessman who traveled on board the ill-fated maiden voyage of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] while on his honeymoon with bride Helen, ''[[née]]'' Walton. They both survived the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']] on 15 April 1912.

==Early life==
Bishop was born in [[Dowagiac, Michigan]], son of George and Virginia Bishop.&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;[http://www.titanicpages.com/1stclass/dickinsonbishop Dickinson Bishop - Titanic First Class Passenger], Titanic Pages.&lt;/ref&gt; He was 24 when he married Mary Beckwith Lee, an heiress who died in 1910 thirteen days after giving birth to a daughter; the infant died minutes after being born.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arseneau|first1=Steven|title=Dowagiac|year=2005|publisher=Arcadia|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738534226|page=71|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=N5aIFtDL-EUC&amp;pg=PA71 |last2=Thompson|first2=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop married his second wife, Helen Walton, in November 1911;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;&lt;ref name="sturgis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sturgisjournal.com/article/20120414/NEWS/304149985 |title=Sturgis native survived Titanic's sinking|first=Rosalie|last=Currier|date=14 April 2012|accessdate=8 February 2014|work=[[Sturgis Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; their four-month honeymoon was to Europe and North Africa, arranging the return on the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt; During their trip, Helen became pregnant, and they acquired a dog named Freu Freu while traveling in Italy.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt;

==''Titanic''==
;Voyage
The Bishops boarded the ''Titanic'' at [[Cherbourg, France]] as First-class passengers on 10 April 1912. Late on the night of the 14th, the Bishops were in their stateroom when the ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg. Soon after, according to Dickinson Bishop, he went on deck to investigate and subsequently returned to the room after being told by stewards that the ship was in no danger. Later, fellow passenger Albert Stewart convinced the Bishops of the danger, and they returned to the boat deck, leaving Freu Freu behind. Although there was no sense of urgency at that point, they both were told to board [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Boat 7 (starboard)|lifeboat #7]].&lt;ref name=michigan /&gt;  In a newspaper interview, Helen Bishop stated that when they went on deck, someone said the newly married couples should be put into the lifeboat first and that there were three newlywed couples in their boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/bishop-interview-concerning-titanic-disaster.html|title=Mr. and Mrs. Bishop Give First Authentic Interview Concerning Titantic [sic] Disaster|date=April 20, 1912|work=Dowagiac Daily News|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this was not mentioned during her later testimony at the US Inquiry into the disaster.

Boat 7 was the first to be lowered from the ''Titanic'', being launched at about 12:45&amp;nbsp;am on the early morning of the 15th, and was rescued by the {{RMS|Carpathia||2}} sometime after 4:10&amp;nbsp;am. The Bishops, along with other survivors, were transported to [[New York City]] aboard the ''Carpathia''.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt;

;Inquiry
Once in New York, the couple was ordered to report to the Senate Board of Inquiry in Washington D.C. Helen Bishop testified first, stating that she was conversing with Mr. and Mrs. [[John Jacob Astor]] prior to the ship's sinking, when [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Smith]] came to speak to Mr. Astor. Astor told the group he was talking with to put on life belts and go on deck. Once on deck, an officer took Mrs. Bishop by the arm and told her to quietly get into the lifeboat; after that, her husband was pushed into the boat with her. Helen Bishop said there were 12 women, 13 men and three crew members in the lifeboat; she continued by saying many of the men in the boat were not married.&lt;ref name=dailynews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/bishops-go-senate-board-inquiry-give-story-titanic-disaster.html|title=Bishops Go Before Senate Board of Inquiry To Give Story Of Titanic Disaster|date=April 26, 1912|work=Dowagiac Daily News|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq11BishopH01.php|title=Testimony of Helen Bishop before the United States Senate Inquiry|date=April 30, 1912|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickinson Bishop's testimony mainly dealt with the inability to lock the ship's watertight compartments. He recalled the sailors trying to turn the locks and not being able to close them properly on either side of the ship.&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt;  Bishop also said that he heard no orders to keep the men out of the lifeboats in favor of women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq11BishopD01.php |title=Testimony of Dickinson H. Bishop before the United States Senate Inquiry|date=April 30, 1912|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop was later rumored to have dressed as a woman to get his spot in the lifeboat; this rumor, in part, led to the divorce of the couple.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;&lt;ref name="michigan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/04/southwest_michigan_newlywed_di.html |title=Titanic tale: Southwest Michigan newlyweds survived ship's sinking but did not live happily ever after|first=Julie|last=Mack|date=7 April 2012|accessdate=8 February 2014|work=[[Booth Newspapers|MLive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfuRDQnYYasC&amp;pg=PT297|title=Unsinkable: The Full Story of the RMS Titanic|editor-last=Butler|editor-first=Daniel Allen|year=2012|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 9780306821035}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 1912, Helen gave birth to a boy, Randall Walton Bishop, who died two days afterward.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt;

==Later life==
In November 1914, the couple suffered a serious car accident in which Helen was badly injured, and where Dickinson suffered only minor injuries. Helen Bishop's head injuries were so severe, they were reported as being fatal by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor-dying.html|title=Titanic Survivor Dying|first=Mark|last=Baber|date=14 November 1914|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to save Helen's life, her doctors tried what was then a new technique: a metal plate was affixed to her skull to cover the badly injured area.&lt;ref name=shadow&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rv1gZo3P0S0C&amp;pg=PA144|title=Shadow of the Titanic: The Extraordinary Stories of Those Who Survived|editor-last=Wilson|editor-first=Andrew|year=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9781451671582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1916, Dickinson and Helen divorced. Charging her husband with cruelty and drunkenness, Helen Bishop was granted a divorce and $100,000 in alimony.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/michigan-wife-gets-100000-alimony.html|title=Michigan Wife Gets $100,000 Alimony|first=Thomas E. |last=Golembiewski|date=18 January 1916|work=[[Chicago's American|Chicago Examiner]]|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died two months later, on March 16, 1916, after falling at a friend's home on a visit to [[Danville, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;&lt;ref name="final"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/bishop-death.html|title=Titanic Survivor Dies In Danville|year=1916|work=Unidentified newspaper|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson married his third wife, Sydney Boyce, a daughter of [[William D. Boyce]], two days before the death of his second wife, Helen. The announcements of Dickinson's remarriage and Helen's death were both front page stories of the ''Dowagiac Daily News'' on the same day.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;&lt;ref name="final"/&gt;

He served in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="final"/&gt; Bishop remained married to Sydney Boyce until her death in November 1950.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; After the end of the war, he moved away from Dowagiac and settled in [[Ottawa, Illinois]] where he died from a [[stroke]] on February 16, 1961.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="final"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/dickinson-bishop.html |title=Mr Dickinson H.

'''Enrico Bondi''' (born 5 October 1934 in [[Arezzo]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] administrator.

Although he graduated in Chemistry, Bondi has extensive experience of re-structuring companies in financial ill-health. Most notably, he took charge of [[Parmalat]] and its subsidiaries during the crisis that followed the ''[[Parmalat bankruptcy timeline|Crac Parmalat]]'' in the early 2000s. This was a period which gave rise to a debt of €14bn.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Biondani, ''Associazione per delinquere nel crac Parmalat'', «Corriere della Sera», 5 novembre 2004, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Bondi is currently{{when|date=November 2017}} the CEO of Parmalat.

On 11 October 2006, Bondi became chairman of [[Parma F.C.]], a position he held until the club's sale to [[Tommaso Ghirardi]] in January 2007.

He was nominated government commissioner for the [[spending review]] by the [[Monti Cabinet]] on 30 April 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6709">{{Main|Fraud}}
'''Extrinsic fraud''' is [[fraud]] that induces one not to present a case in court or deprives one of the opportunity to be heard or is not involved in the actual issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrinsic Fraud|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/extrinsic_fraud|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, it is defined as:
{{quote|fraudulent acts which keep a person from obtaining information about his/her rights to enforce a contract or getting evidence to defend against a lawsuit. This could include destroying evidence or misleading an ignorant person about the right to sue. Extrinsic fraud is distinguished from "intrinsic fraud," which is the fraud that is the subject of a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrinsic Fraud|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=714|website=Law.com|publisher=ALM|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Extrinsic fraud often involves [[fraud upon the court|fraud on the court]], but may arise in other contexts. Extrinsic fraud does not mean merely lying or [[perjury]], nor [[misrepresentation]]s, nor [[intrinsic fraud]], nor "to matters that could have been raised during the divorce proceeding."&lt;ref name=Ellett&gt;''Ellett v.

==Examples==
===Family law===
{{see also|Paternity fraud}}
Extrinsic fraud may be claimed in [[family law]] and [[domestic relations]] cases. For example, [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] cases are sometimes the subject of extrinsic fraud; the classic case is when a man is encouraged to sign an [[Acknowledgment (law)|acknowledgment]] that he is the father of a newborn baby, thus giving up his right to contest the matter in a [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draper|first1=Heather|title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=August 2007|volume=33|issue=8|pages=475–480|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268|pmc=2598159|pmid=17664309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Love v. Love'', the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] ruled that extrinsic fraud had led the putative father to sign an admission against his interest, thus allowing the court to grant [[equitable relief]] to undo the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Love v. Love, 114 Nev. 572, 959 P.2d 523, 527 (1998)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15814209693472959900|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also may occur when a man fails to appear in court when a paternity suit is filed against him, thus resulting in a [[default judgment]] due to the fraud by his "[[paramour]]".&lt;ref&gt;Denise G. Callahan, "Insufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud leads to reversal in W." Daily Record and the [[Kansas City Daily News-Press]], October 7, 2005, found at [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4181/is_20051007/ai_n15671746 Find Articles website]. "In the best interest of a child, the state of Missouri defended a mother who fooled a man into thinking he had fathered a son.  In ''State of Missouri ex rel. Misty Lowry v. Richard Carter'', the Department of Social Services, Family Support Division appealed Jackson County Judge Sandra Carol Midkiff's ruling that set aside a 1993 default paternity judgment against Carter. The Western District Court of Appeals sided with the state."  Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In such cases, there is a high burden of proof (typically [[moral certainty]] or [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]) of the [[petitioner]] to prove the intrinsic fraud, because of the state's interest "in the [[best interests of the child]]" to ensure that every [[youth|child]] has a [[father]].  That is called [[Estoppel|paternity by estoppel]], in which the putative father is actually prevented from proving he is ''not'' the father due to the high standard of evidence necessary as a matter of law.

===Other examples===
Extrinsic fraud may occur in [[real estate]] transactions or financing, such as when a [[lender]] forces a homeowner to lose his or her [[real property]] in a [[foreclosure]] through acts of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voce v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10796894224547017689|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lawyer who [[intent (law)|intentionally]] keeps information from his or her client about an upcoming [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] or [[trial]] could be held responsible for extrinsic fraud, as well as being subject to disciplinary action and a [[legal malpractice]] lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldberg v. Frye, 217 Cal.App.3d 1258, 266 Cal.Rptr. 483, 489 (1990).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13570449622292688667|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is at least theoretically possible for a court to [[Injunction|enjoin]] a criminal proceeding, but unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;"Equity Jurisdiction: Enjoining Execution of Criminal Judgment: Extrinsic and Intrinsic Fraud", California Law Review, Vol. 11, No. 4 (May, 1923), pp. 279-282, found at[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3474313 JSTOR website].  Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[writ of habeas corpus]]'' or ''[[Coram nobis|writ of error coram nobis]]'' may be possible as well.

An activist in [[Berkeley, California]] sued the [[University of California]] over its long-term plan, for alleged extrinsic fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brenneman, "Activist Files Motion Calling UC Deal ‘Extrinsic Fraud’", ''[[Berkeley Daily Planet]]'', June 28, 2005, found at

{{Refimprove|Strong claims like 'must come from' should be referenced and qualified.|date=May 2010}}

A '''fair trade certification''' is a [[product certification]] within the market-based [[social movement|movement]] [[fair trade]]. The most widely used fair trade certification is [[FLO International]]'s, the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], used in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] is the North American equivalent of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.  As of January 2011, there were over 1000 companies certified to the FLO International's certification and a further 1000 or so certified to other ethical and fairtrade certification schemes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekobai.org/search/profiles/1522/list-of-companies-with-fairtrade] List of Companies certified to FLO International's fairtrade certification&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade International certification system covers a wide range of products, including banana, coffee, cocoa, cotton, cane sugar, flowers and plants, honey, dried fruit, fruit juices, herbs, spices, tea, nuts and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, K. (2012). ''Is my Fair Trade coffee really fair? Trends and Challenges in Fair Trade certification. Center for Global Development, Policy Paper, pp.17.''&lt;/ref&gt; These commodities have different locations of production and number of farmers and workers covered for production and distribution.

==How it works==
Fair trade is a strategy for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, aiming at creating greater equity in the international trading system. Through trading partnerships with marginalised farmers and craftspeople in developing countries, social and economic opportunities are created for these producers in a way that more customers are accessible to their products and a better deal is issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtradefederation.org, (2014). ''Fair Trade Federation : What is Fair Trade?.'' [online] Available at: https://www.fairtradefederation.org/what-is-fair-trade/ [Accessed 19 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the producers have to comply with all the standards laid down by [[Fairtrade International]].

In reality, packers in developed countries pay a fee to the Fairtrade organisation for the right to use the Fairtrade certification logo. Importers of fairtrade certified products are required to pay exporters a price higher than the market price of non-fairtrade certified products, so as to cover the additional costs used by Fairtrade certified firms in marketing and inspection. Any surplus after paying these costs must be used for local social, environmental and economic projects &lt;ref&gt;Info.fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade Info / Home / What is Fairtrade? / How Fairtrade Works.'' [online] Available at: http://info.fairtrade.net/info-how-fairtrade-works.0.html [Accessed 24 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade Standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton.]]
Fairtrade Standards are designed to aid the sustainable development of some smaller producers and agricultural workers in [[third world countries]]. In order to become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their fellow farmers have to strictly comply with the standards laid down by Fairtrade International.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade International / Standards / Aims of Fairtrade standards.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.net/aims-of-fairtrade-standards.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].)&lt;/ref&gt; FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, is responsible for inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 70 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The general standards set for different stakeholders are listed as follows:

===Small Producer Organizations===
* The majority of the members of the organization must be small-scale producers who do not highly depend on hired workers, but run their farm mainly by their own effort.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations. (2005). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Any profits earned must be equally distributed among the producers. 
* Every member in the organisation should have the right to vote in the decision-making process.

===Hired Labour===
* Workers possess the right to join an independent union to [[collective bargaining|collectively bargain]] their working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Strong Producers, Strong Future. (2014). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* No forced or child labour 
* Working conditions have to be equitable for all workers. Salaries must be at least equal or higher than the [[minimum wage]] in effect. 
* Safety and health measures must be implemented properly so as to avoid unwanted injuries at work.

===Trade Standards===
* Pay a price higher than the Fairtrade Minimum Price in order to cover the costs of sustainable production.
* Pay an additional amount of money that allows producers to invest in development : the Fairtrade Premium.
* Sign contracts that assist long-term planning and sustainable production practices.

==Fairtrade Pricing==
The Fairtrade system mainly consists of two types of pricing, which are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporters according to the proportion of output companies are able to sell with the brand ‘Fairtrade Certified’, typically ranging from 17% to up to 60% of their turnover in some cases.

* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price, as well as the minimum price, that must be paid by buyers to Fairtrade Certified producers. It is a floor price that covers producers’ average cost of production, aiming at protecting producers from selling their products underpriced.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade International / About / What is Fairtrade?.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.net/what-is-fairtrade.html [Accessed 26 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is a sum of money which is paid on top of the payment for the products. Its use is restricted to investment in the producers’ business, livelihood, and the socio-economic development of the workers. The producers have the largest power deciding how these funds are to be spent.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Minimum Price And Fairtrade Premium Table. (2014). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How fairtrade measures its impact==
The Fairtrade system has committed to a programme of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL), which aims at generating recommendations and analysis in support of greater effectiveness and impact. Ongoing market progress is monitored by market-facing organizations present in countries where Fairtrade certified products are sold; market data is consolidated by Fairtrade International on an annual basis. These data are gathered to form a core basis for the understanding of the dynamics of how certification is developing, and how the impacts of Fairtrade are being distributed between producer organizations, geographies and products.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.org.uk, (2014). ''How Fairtrade monitors and measures impact''. [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/what-is-fairtrade/the-impact-of-our-work/how-fairtrade-monitors-and-measures-impact [Accessed 24 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.org.uk, (2014). ''How Fairtrade monitors and measures impact.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/what-is-fairtrade/the-impact-of-our-work/how-fairtrade-monitors-and-measures-impact [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade’s governance bodies also review key results and evaluate regularly in order to improve strategy and decision-making. These results are publicised within staff throughout the Fairtrade system and relevant stakeholders for further discussion of findings and recommendations.

==Criticisms==

===Little money reaches the farmers===
[[The Fairtrade Foundation]] does not monitor how much of the extra amount of money paid to exporters reaches the farmers. As the cooperatives incur relatively heavy fees on inspection, certification and marketing, only a small amount of money is retained for the farmers.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, (2014). ''Fairtrade coffee fails to help the poor, British report finds.'' [online] Available at: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/fairtrade-coffee-fails-to-help-the-poor-british-report-finds/article18852585/ [Accessed 27 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, R. (2014). ''Fairtrade 'fails to help poor farmers', says damning investigation.'' [online] Mail Online. Available at: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2639135/Fairtrade-fails-help-poor-farmers-Damning-investigation-says-profits-sent-help-Uganda-Ethiopia-not-reach-workforce.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Fairtrade producers are only able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified over years, while the rest are sold as uncertified at the market prices.

===Fairtrade helps the rich to a larger extent===
Fair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries rather than that in poor countries. In order to qualify as Fairtrade producers, cooperatives must meet the strict standards set by Fairtrade International, implying that their fellow farmers must be quite skilful and educated. However, it is criticised that these farmers are predominantly from poorest countries, thus lacking the power to bargain with the cooperatives. Corruption even occurs in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Sylla, N. (2014). ''Fairtrade is an unjust movement that serves the rich | Ndongo Samba Sylla. [online] the Guardian. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/05/fairtrade-unjust-movement-serves-rich [Accessed 26 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inefficient marketing system===
There have been complaints that Fairtrade certified products should not be sold through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative because it may be inefficient and corruption easily takes place. Fairtrade farmers should have the right to choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperatives are going bankrupt &lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). ''Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), pp. 42)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other certification and product labelings==
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] does not certify individual products, but instead evaluates an entire business.
* The FTO Mark, launched in 2004 by [[World Fair Trade Organization]], and identifies registered fair trade organizations.
* [[UTZ Certified|UTZ CERTIFIED]] is a coffee certification program that has sometimes been dubbed "[[Fairtrade]] lite" &lt;ref name="Conroy, Michael 2007 pp.252"&gt;Conroy, Michael (2007). Branded! p252&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federico Cerruti''' (1 January 1922 – 15 July 2015) was a reclusive Italian art collector whose collection was described by ''Artribune'' as one of the best in Europe. He told his retainers to arrange his funeral before his death became public in order to avoid the "useless gossiping and socialising crowd" attending.

==Early life==
Federico Cerruti was born in [[Genoa]] on 1 January 1922. His family were bookbinders who moved to Turin where the firm prospered despite its factory being destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. In 1943, Cerruti narrowly escaped death when a ship he should have been on, the battleship ''[[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|Roma]]'', was sunk by German aircraft.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

==Career==
Cerruti was brought up with a strong work ethic. He studied accountancy and expanded the family business of  [[Legatoria Industriale Torinese]] to one of the largest bookbinders in Italy. The firm had the contract to bind the telephone directories of Italy. He lived above the office, and only slept at the villa he had built for him, once in 50 years. His assistant for 30 years was Annalisa Ferrari.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

==Art collection==
Cerruti's collection was described by ''Artribune'' as one of the best in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artribune.com/2015/07/il-collezionista-misterioso-che-vinse-su-uffizi-e-getty-museum-morto-a-torino-a-93-anni-federico-cerruti-la-sua-una-delle-migliori-raccolte-deuropa/ Il collezionista “misterioso” che vinse su Uffizi e Getty Museum.

Retrieved 15 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It ranged from the Medieval period to works of the 20th Century. The first work he acquired was a drawing by the Russian [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. He also owned ten works by modern Italian [[Metaphysical art|Metaphysical]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] which hung in the dining room of his villa. In the main bedroom were late Medieval and early Renaissance paintings by [[Paolo Veneziano]], [[Sassetta]], and [[Bergognone]]. Cerruti often allowed his works to be shown at exhibitions and small groups of art lovers were allowed to view his collection.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

Appropriately, Cerruti also collected books in fine bindings. He owned the ''[[Atlas Maior]]'' by [[Joan Blaeu]] in 12 volumes and an edition of ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' in an [[Art Deco]] design by [[Pierre Legrain]].&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

==Death==
Cerruti died on 15 July 2015. He never married and left no descendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornaledellarte.com/articoli/2015/7/124738.html Era il più importante collezionista d'arte d'Italia.] ''Il Giornale Dell' Arte.Com'', 16 July 2015. Retrieved 28 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He told Annalisa Ferrari to arrange his funeral before his death became public in order to avoid the "useless gossiping and socialising crowd" attending. He was interred with an ivory crucifix and photographs of his mother and [[Padre Pio]].&lt;ref name=artnews&gt;[http://theartnewspaper.com/news/obituary/158441/ Was this unknown man Italy’s greatest collector?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 7 September 2015.

==Legacy==
Around 2013, Cerruti created the Fondazione FC in which he vested his collection and villa, as well as a capital sum.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

[[File:Giovanni Battista Giorgini, prima sfilata di alta moda italiana.jpg|thumb|villa Torrigiani, via dei Serragli, Firenze ([[Giardino Torrigiani]])]]
'''Giovanni Battista Giorgini''' (Forte dei Marmi, 25 August 1898 - Florence, 2 January 1971), was an Italian entrepreneur and member of the Giorgini family.

==Early life and family==
Giovanni Battista Giorgini, the Giorgini family descends from a noble family from Lucca. His great-grandfather Charles was a member of the Kingdom of Italy and was the brother of Senator Giovanni Battista Giorgini and brother-in-law of Vittoria Manzoni, the eighth daughter of Alessandro Manzoni. His father, Vittorio Giorgini (1860-1919) helped his brother Alessandro in the family business dedicated to the marble trade, but he had an artistic spirit. The mother, Florence Rochat (1860-1942) was Waldensian and originally from Francophone Switzerland. The boy grew up in a cultured and cosmopolitan environment and undertook classical studies at the University of Pisa.

At the age of 17, he followed his family footsteps and enrolled as a volunteer in infantry to participate in the First World War. Impressed by the horrors of the war promoted the Christian Youth Association, equivalent to the evangelical organization "Young Men's Christian Association" (YMCA).

In 1921 he married Zaira Augusta Nanni with whom he had three children: Graziella, Vittorio and Matilde.

==Career==
The following year he moved to Florence where he decided to start his own business by opening the "GB Giorgini &amp; Co. Import-export" in via Calzaioli 9. He actively promotes Tuscan art, antiques and crafts, and in 1924 he will make his first commercial trip to the United States. This trip was particularly painful because at the time Italian exporters were not well seen overseas. He decided to develop contacts with the "Italian House of Columbia University", "Italy America Society" and the YMCA and at the same time he selected a high quality Italian craftsmanship.

The crack of 1929 gave a heavy blow to his work and forced him to close his New York office. The years that followed were very unstable until the end of the Second World War , when the allies entrusted him with the management of the "Allied Forces Gift Shop" of Florence, a pole in charge of selling products to Anglo-American troops. In those years he quickly resumed contact with all the Italian artisans with whom he had worked before the war, and of course with the American buyers.

Skillful businessman immediately sees the potential of Italian fashion, then almost unknown in the world. Everything took place in Paris, where the few non-French designers opened their Ateliers ( Cristobal Balenciaga , Elsa Schiaparelli , etc.). Giovanni Battista Giorgini took the initiative to organize the "First Italian High Fashion Show" at his private residence in Florence at Villa Torrigiani. The parade was held February 12, 1951 in the presence of six major American buyers, who, as he himself said in various interviews, went to Florence as a simple courtesy visit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 "Italy gets dressed up"], ''[[LIFE]]'', 20 August 1951, pp. 104-112 (p. 105).&lt;/ref&gt; It was: Gertrude Ziminsky for B. Altman and Company of New York, John Nixon for Henry Morgan of Montreal, Ethel Francau, Jessica Daves and Julia Trissel for Bergdorf Goodman of New York, Stella Hanania for I. Magnin of San Francisco. Giorgini had planned to present 18 models of 10 Italian fashion houses. Among those who presented their models there were: the atelier Carosa (of the princess Giovanna Caracciolo), Alberto Fabiani , the atelier Simonetta (of the Duchess Simonetta Colonna Visconti ), Emilio Schuberth the Sorelle Fontana , Jole Veneziani , the tailor Vanna (of Manette Valente), Vita Noberasko and Germana Marucelli . They were added for theprêt-à-porter Emilio Pucci , Giorgio Avolio, The weaver of the Island (of the baroness Clarette Gallotti) and Mirsa (of the marquise Olga of Gresy). Giorgini's resourcefulness, the quality of the products, the buyers' reputation and the support of some journalists like Irene Brin , who as Italian editor for Harper's Bazaar advertised the event overseas, decreed its success.

It was a very exceptional event, because from that moment it really began to talk about Italian fashion. The second parade was held in July 1951 in the halls of the "Grand Hotel" in Florence. Since 1952, two seasons of fashion shows have been organized in the Sala Bianca of Palazzo Pitti , one in January and the other in July. In 1954 the Florence Center for Italian fashion was born, with its first director Mario Vannini Parenti.

In the 1960s, he succeeded in conquering the Japanese market, selling Italian creations to "Isetan", one of the most important department stores in the country. Sensing also the importance of prêt-à-porter manages to introduce him in the Florentine fashion shows, but this will be a cause of conflict with the great Roman fashion houses that will decide in 1967 to create Haute Couture fashion shows directly in Rome.

==Death and legacy==
Giorgini died on January 2, 1971 in Florence, at Villa Torrigiani (that of the Torrigiani Garden), and was buried in the Cemetery of the Allori in via Senese.

His personal archive was filed in 2005 by his nephew Neri Fadigati at the Florence State Archives.

The '''Global Business Simulation Strategy Game,''' or "Glo-Bus," by [[McGraw-Hill]] Irwin is a [[Business simulation]] game.

It was developed in 2008 to help educate students in the field of Business Strategy. Glo-Bus is the sister game to its old brother Business Strategy Game that dates back to the early 1990s.

The strategy game focuses upon aspects such as Production design, marketing, assembly (for both entry-level and multi-featured), compensation and labor, discount bids, corporate citizenship,and finance and cash flow.

Every player makes decisions in their respective companies which is submitted before a due date in which the game "turns" one year. The next financial year shows who has met investor expectations or who is clearly the most profitable in the industry.

The five criteria which companies are ranked on are [[earnings per share]], [[credit rating]], stock price, [[return on equity]], and image rating.

The Business Strategy Game is used in many post secondary [[Bachelor of Business]] programs in North America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is usually a cornerstone assignment in a [[strategic management]] class. Those who are able to beat their entire class are crowned Industry Champions and are invited to attend the Glo-Bus Invitational (BSI). Roughly 8% of all students who play Glo-Bus become Industry Champions. Those who win the BSI (Less than half a percent of all students who have played Glo-Bus), become Grand Champions which is the highest level of accomplishment in the Business Strategy Game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Guus Kouwenhoven'''&lt;ref&gt;see eg. http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6412&lt;/ref&gt;, often misspelled as '''Gus Kouwenhoven''' or '''Guus van Kouwenhoven'''&lt;ref&gt; http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/TaylorCharles/KouwenhovenGus.htm &lt;/ref&gt; (born 15 September 1942, [[Rotterdam]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] arms dealer convicted for arms trafficking in [[Liberia]] during the presidency of [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]]. 

==Deported from the US==
In the 1970, Kouwenhoven was sentenced to two years in prison in the US after being caught in an FBI sting operation while attempting to sell 6 stolen artworks, including a [[Rembrandt]]. He served only 17 days and was deported from the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/crimes-against-humanity-anatomy-of-an-arms-dealer-478792.html|title=Crimes against humanity: Anatomy of an arms dealer|first=Daniel|last=Howden|date=18 May 2006|publisher=Independent|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Liberia==
Kouwenhoven started his career in Liberia in the 1980s as the manager of Hotel Africa&lt;ref&gt;see eg. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/27/theobserver &lt;/ref&gt; and lateron headed the Oriental Timber Corporation (OTC), the main timber company in Liberia in the early 2000s, during the [[Second Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]]. The company was used as a cover for arms smuggling.&lt;ref name=iol-arrest/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor-made&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/taylormade2.pdf|title=Taylor Made: The Pivotal Role of Liberia's Forests and Flag of Convenience in Regional Conflict|publisher=Global Witness|date=2001|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] issued an order in 2001 banning him from traveling because of arms trafficking.&lt;ref name=taylor-made/&gt;

==Trials==
Kouwenhoven was arrested in the Netherlands on 18 March 2005 and stood trial at the [[Judiciary of the Netherlands#District Courts|Court of First Instance]] in [[The Hague]], starting 24 April 2006, charged with arms smuggling and war crimes in Liberia in the 90s, for which the Dutch public prosecutors sought a 20-year jail sentence and a fine of €450,000. The court tried to summon Charles Taylor to testify against Kouwenhoven.  On 7 June 2006 Kouwenhoven was sentenced to 8 years in jail for arms smuggling. The court did not find him guilty of war crimes. Both the public prosecutors and Kouwenhoven sought a higher court appeal and Kouwenhoven was released in March 2007 in anticipation of his new trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rd.nl/vandaag/binnenland/kouwenhoven-vrij-tot-rechtszaak-1.1150680|title=Kouwenhoven vrij tot rechtszaak|date=19 March 2017|language=nl|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=Reformatorisch Dagblad}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Judiciary of the Netherlands#Courts of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] in The Hague acquitted him of all charges on 10 March 2008 and sharply criticized the work of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6412|title=Guus Kouwenhoven|publisher=Hague Justice Portal|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution appealed the acquittal to the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]] on 20 March 2008. In April 2010 the Supreme Court ordered a re-trial at the court in [[Den Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=11630|title=Dutch Supreme Court quashes Court of Appeal decision in Guus K. case|date=20 April 2010|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=The Hague Justice Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, the court in Den Bosch was to hear arguments for dismissal as there were no witnesses available to testify.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''H. Upmann &amp; Co'''. was a [[Bank]] based in [[Cuba]], with a subsidiary branch in [[Bremen|Breme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n, Germany, it was founded in 1844 and presided over by [[Hermann Dietrich Upmann]].  It closed in 1922.

== History ==
H. Upmann &amp; Co. was very successful through the purchase of promissory notes in Madrid during the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. Due to the [[American blockade on Cuba|American blockade]] during the war, the Spanish government was dependent on H. Upmann’s bank to finance his war efforts. Because of the unrest in Cuba many bankers decided to withdraw their money from Cuba in 1896. As a representative of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]] and other important customers, H. Upmann &amp; Co. transferred large quantities of [[gold]] and [[Silver|silve]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r to its office in [[New York City|New York]], which had been a [[Financial centre|financial center]] and trading hub with the [[Caribbean Islands|Caribbean islands]] since the [[18th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.stadterkundungen-bielefeld.de/fileadmin/user_upload/stadterkundungen/download/H._Upmann_Zigarre_Aufsatz_Schulte_Beerbuehl__Frey_2.pdf|title=Die H. Upmann Zigarre – Der Bielefelder Hermann Dietrich Upmann und die Schaffung einer Weltmarke|last=Beerbühl|first=Margrit Schulte|publisher=Altenberend/Reinhard Vogelsang. Bielefeld|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bielefeld,Germany|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Herrings, a war correspondent, described the Upmann banking house as "the most important banking company in Cuba, perhaps in the whole of West India." &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Herrings: ''Kuba und der Krieg'',New York 1899, S. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Hermann Friedrich Upmann in 1910, the bank was presided by his nephew’s, Hermann Friedrich and Albert Upmann and [[Theodore Garbade]],a partner of the bank who quit the bank in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=2MozAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Theodor+Garbade&amp;dq=Theodor+Garbade&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1tMPv18rWAhWRaVAKHdvNDdQQ6AEIPDAD|title=The London Banks and Kindred Companies and Firms ...|last=(bart.)|first=Sir Thomas Skinner|date=1916|publisher=T. Skinner &amp; Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=504|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Havana the bank built its own business house in [[Havana]] on the corner of the Amargura and Mercader’s streets. Built in 1904, it was the first building of its kind. It houses today the agency of the [[Central Bank of Cuba]] (before called the Cuban National Bank).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldhavanaweb.com/h_upmann_bank_building.html|title=H. Upmann Bank Building|website=www.oldhavanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, H. Upmann's [[asset]]s were seized by the Custodian of Alien Enemy properties in the United States, and the firm was placed on the US Enemy Trade List. With the end of [[World War I]], in 1918, Cuba's economic situation had worsened dramatically, especially after its great crash 1920 that brought unfathomable consequences to thousands of workers who lost their jobs. Due to these difficulties, H. Upmann &amp; Co. - like so many others - left in 1922 and was sold for a mere 30,000 pesos.&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, ''Upmann Bank of Havana has $9,136,000 in Liabilities'', Monday, 27 November 1922, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, on September 3, 1925, Herman passed away and his brother Albert moved to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.juventudrebelde.cu/columnas/lecturas/2016-09-24/la-larga-saga-de-h-upmann|title=La larga saga de H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4571">The '''Golden World Awards''' is an annual global awards ceremony organised by the '''International [[Public relations|Public Relations]] Association (IPRA)''' to recognise public relations achievements around the world across different categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IPRA Official Website|title=History of IPRA and PR awards|url=http://www.ipra.org/about/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1990, the Golden World Awards (also dubbed as the 'Oscars of PR') has 65 categories of In-house and Agency entries judged separately, and honours the overall highest standards of each year with the IPRA Grand Prix for Excellence award.

==Entry criteria==

In the preliminary stage of judging the jury will only consider the programme summaries submitted so great care must be taken in the preparation. Its length is limited to twelve hundred words (1,200) and must be entirely in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden World Awards Rules for entry|url=http://gwa.ipra.org/general-information/rules|publisher=IPRA|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All entries are submitted online to the IPRA secretariat and must include an opening 100-word statement describing why the programme should be deemed worthy of an award. Under separate headlines, each entry should then address all of these five areas:

# Statement of Problem/Opportunity
# Research
# Planning
# Execution
# Campaign Outcomes / Monitoring and Evaluation

Supporting documents will also need to be submitted after the entry is shortlisted by a panel of judges at the preliminary round of judging.

==Award categories==

For each of the categories below Agency and Inhouse entries will be judged separately and separate awards made. In addition, the overall highest achievement of each year is awarded the ''''Grand Prix for Excellence''''.

The '''Incoterms''' or '''International Commercial Terms''' are a series of pre-defined commercial terms published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) relating to [[international commercial law]]. They are widely used in international [[commercial transaction]]s or [[procurement]] processes and their use is encouraged by trade councils, courts and international lawyers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vishny|first1=Paul H.|title=Guide to international commerce law|date=1981|publisher=West Group|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=0070675139}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the global or international transportation and delivery of goods. Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit terms, govern [[contract law]] or define where title to goods transfers.

The Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from differing interpretation of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-guide-to-incoterms-2010 | title = ICC Guide to Incoterms® 2010 | accessdate = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide.

"Incoterms" is a registered [[trademark]] of the ICC.

The first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936. The Incoterms rules were amended in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = 
https://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts_endorsed/INCOTERMS1953_e.pdf |title = Incoterms® 1953 | accessdate = October 13, 2016 | publisher = UNCITRAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990, and 2000, with the eighth version— '''Incoterms 2010''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2010 |title = Incoterms® 2010 | accessdate = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; — having been published on January 1, 2011. The ICC has begun consultations on a new revision of Incoterms, to be called ''[[Incoterms#Incoterms 2020|Incoterms 2020]]''.

==Incoterms 2010==
[[File:Incoterms map.png|thumb|right|350px|National Incoterms chambers]]
''Incoterms 2010'' is the eighth set of pre-defined international contract terms published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], with the first set having been published in 1936. ''Incoterms 2010'' defines 11 rules, down from the 13 rules defined by ''Incoterms 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2000 | title = Incoterms® 2000 | accessdate = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four rules of the 2000 version ("Delivered at Frontier"; DAF, "Delivered Ex Ship"; DES, "Delivered Ex Quay"; DEQ, "Delivered Duty Unpaid"; DDU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://iccwbo.org/publication/incoterms-rules-2010/ | title = From the introduction of Incoterms 2010 | accessdate = May 16, 2011 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; were removed, and are replaced by two new rules ("Delivered at Terminal"; DAT, "Delivered at Place"; DAP) in the 2010 rules.

In the prior version, the rules were divided into four categories, but the 11 pre-defined terms of ''Incoterms 2010'' are subdivided into two categories ''based only on method of delivery''. The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where the condition of the goods can be verified at the point of loading on board ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.

Incoterms 2010 also formally defined delivery. Before, the term has been defined informally but it is now defined as the point in the transaction where "the risk of loss or damage [to the goods] passes from the seller to the buyer."&lt;ref&gt;Incoterms® 2010 English Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incoterms in government regulations==
In some jurisdictions, the duty costs of the goods may be calculated against a specific Incoterm: for example in [[India]], duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp Brief on Customs Valuation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Directorate General of Valuation&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Africa]] the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|title=Valuation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=sars.gov.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this it is common for contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.

==Defined terms in Incoterms==
There are certain terms that have special meaning within Incoterms, and some of the more important ones are defined below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August ; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=0273768611|edition=6th ed., international}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Delivery: The point in the transaction where the risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer 
* Arrival: The point named in the Incoterm to which carriage has been paid
* Free: Seller has an obligation to deliver the goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier
* Carrier: Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes
* [[Freight forwarder]]: A firm that makes or assists in the making of shipping arrangements;
* Terminal: Any place, whether covered or not, such as a dock, warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal
* To clear for export: To file Shipper’s Export Declaration and get export permit

==Variation of Incoterms==
Parties adopting Incoterms should be wary about their intention and variations. The desire of the parties should be expressed clearly and casual adoption should be refrained. Also, making additions or variations to the meaning of a certain term should be carefully done as parties' failure to use any trade term at all can produce unexpected results.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Rules for any mode of transport==

==={{anchor|Ex Works}}EXW – Ex Works (named place of delivery)===
The seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.

EXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.

There is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.

These documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf |title = Customs Information Paper (11) 89 | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = HMRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA ''seller's premises'', may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/faqs/incoterms-rules/inco-question-7/ |title = Evidence of export | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = Strong &amp; Herd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Free Carrier}}FCA – Free Carrier (named place of delivery)===

The seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place (possibly including the seller's own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.

In many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. It should also be noted that the chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.

If delivery occurs at the seller's premises, or at any other location that is under the seller's control, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier.

=== CPT – Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) ===

CPT replaces the  C&amp;F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized seafreight.

The seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export.

The seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer's facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however).

If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead.

==={{anchor|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}CIP – Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)===

This term is broadly similar to the above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods to be able to make a claim.

CIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea-freight.

===DAT – Delivered At Terminal (named terminal at port or place of destination)===

This Incoterm requires that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named terminal. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.

The terminal can be a Port, Airport, or inland freight interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead.

All charges after unloading (for example, Import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, it is important to note that any delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller's account.

===DAP – Delivered At Place (named place of destination)===

Incoterms 2010 defines DAP as 'Delivered at Place' – the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.

Once goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is carried out by the seller at his own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at his own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.

After arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs and etc., including all customs duties and taxes. 

Under DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/the-incoterms-rules/|title=Incoterms® rules 2010 - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|author=|date=|website=iccwbo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/faq/eg_main_043740.asp|title=Exporting FAQs - Expor.gov - export.gov|author=|date=|website=www.export.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|DDP}}DDP – Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)===

Seller is responsible for delivering the  goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm "Free In Store (FIS)". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incotermsexplained.com/the-incoterms-rules/the-eleven-rules-in-brief/delivered-duty-paid/|title=Delivered Duty Paid - Incoterms Explained|author=|date=|website=incotermsexplained.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the goods through customs in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.

==Rules for sea and inland waterway transport==

To determine if a location qualifies for these four rules, please refer to 'United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations ([[UN/LOCODE]])'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html|title=UN/LOCODE Code List by Country -  Trade - UNECE|author=|date=|website=www.unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four rules defined by Incoterms 2010 for international trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below. It is important to note that these terms are generally not suitable for shipments in shipping containers; the point at which risk and responsibility for the goods passes is when the goods are loaded on board the ship, and if the goods are sealed into a shipping container it is impossible to verify the condition of the goods at this point.

Also of note is that the point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from previous editions of Incoterms, where the risk passed at the ship's rail.

===FAS – Free Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)===
The seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.

===FOB – Free on Board (named port of shipment)===

{{Main|FOB_(shipping)|label 1=FOB (Shipping)}}

Under FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are "appropriated to the contract" that is, they are "clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0132718979|title=International Business Law 6th Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some [[common law countries]] such as the [[United States|United States of America]], FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any "vessel, car or other vehicle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Day|title=The law of international trade|date=2003|publisher=Butterworths|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0406921830|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CFR – Cost and Freight (named port of destination)===
The seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer does require the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.

==={{anchor|Cost, Insurance and Freight}}CIF – Cost, Insurance &amp; Freight (named port of destination)===
This term is broadly similar to the above CFR term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the [[bill of lading]]. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.

==Previous terms from ''Incoterms 2000'' eliminated from ''Incoterms 2010''==

While these terms do not feature in the current version of Incoterms it is possible that they may be seen in sales order contracts. Care must be taken to ensure that both parties agree on their obligations in this case.

===DAF – Delivered at Frontier (named place of delivery)===
This term can be used when the goods are transported by rail and road. The seller pays for transportation to the named place of delivery at the frontier. The buyer arranges for customs clearance and pays for transportation from the frontier to his factory. The passing of risk occurs at the frontier.

===DES – Delivered Ex Ship ===

Where goods are delivered ex ship, the passing of risk does not occur until the ship has arrived at the named port of destination and the goods made available for unloading to the buyer. The seller pays the same freight and insurance costs as he would under a CIF arrangement. Unlike CFR and CIF terms, the seller has agreed to bear not just cost, but also Risk and Title up to the arrival of the vessel at the named port. Costs for unloading the goods and any duties, taxes, etc. are for the Buyer. A commonly used term in shipping bulk commodities, such as coal, grain, dry chemicals; and where the seller either owns or has chartered their own vessel.

===DEQ – Delivered Ex Quay (named port of delivery)===

This is similar to DES, but the passing of risk does not occur until the goods have been unloaded at the port of discharge.

===DDU – Delivered Duty Unpaid (named place of destination)===

This term means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer to the named place of destination in the contract of sale.
A transaction in international trade where the seller is responsible for making a safe delivery of goods to a named destination, paying all transportation and customs clearance expenses but not the duty. The seller bears the risks and costs associated with supplying the goods to the delivery location, where the buyer becomes responsible for paying the duty and taxes.

==Incoterms 2020==
New Incoterms are expected to appear in the last quarter of 2019, ready to enter into force on 1 January 2020.&lt;ref name=Llamazares&gt;Llamazares, O., [https://www.globalnegotiator.com/blog_en/incoterms-2020-main-changes/ Incoterms 2020: Main Changes], accessed 25 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC's Incoterms 2020 Drafting Group includes lawyers, traders and company representatives from around the world, mostly European but also from China and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;ICC, [https://iccwbo.org/resources-for-business/incoterms-rules/incoterms-rules-history/ Incoterms rules history], accessed 3 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Llamazares /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3953">'''Ivan Čermak'''{{Pronunciation needed}} (born 19 December 1949) is a [[Croatia]]n businessman, politician and former general.

==Biography==
Born in [[Zagreb]], Čermak became a small businessman in the 1980s. In the 1990s, he entered the oil business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nezavisne.com/komentari/kolumne/Cermak-ili-prica-o-hrvatskom-uspjehu-14138.html | newspaper = [[Nezavisne novine]] | author = Denis Kuljiš | language = Croatian | title = Čermak, ili priča o hrvatskom uspjehu | date = 2007-09-08 | accessdate = 2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 1991, Čermak held the position of Vice President of the Executive Board of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and also served as an advisor to the President of the Republic of Croatia, [[Franjo Tuđman]]. In 1991, he was appointed the Assistant Minister of Defence in the Croatian Government, a position he held until 1993. While in this position and thereafter, he held the rank of [[Colonel General]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
He was succeeded in this position by his former chauffeur, [[Vladimir Zagorec]].&lt;ref name=Lesen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.at/a/ex-general-vladimir-zagorec-vom-landvermesser-kroaten-220538|work=News Networld Internetservice GmbH

In February 2004, he was indicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and brought to [[Trial of Gotovina et al]] in the Hague on charges of operating a joint criminal enterprise for the purpose of permanently removing the [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb population]] from the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Krajina]] by force and of crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICTY-IT-06-90&gt;{{citation

'''Laurits Christian Meulengracht''' or '''Laurits Christopher Meulengracht''' (14 February 1837 - 9 April 1903) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] businessman and [[brewer]] who became one of the wealthiest men in Denmark in the 19th century. He received the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] and [[Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Lars_Christian_Meulengracht_(1837-1903) |title=Lars Christian Meulengracht (1837-1903) |publisher=Aarhus City Archives |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kTKzHJ3h?url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Lars_Christian_Meulengracht_(1837-1903) |archive-date=12 September 2016 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lund"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lundskov.dk/menu/aarhusperson.htm |title=Meulengracht slægten |publisher=Lundskov |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130701052124/http://www.lundskov.dk/menu/aarhusperson.htm |archive-date=1 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His father Lars Christian Meulengracht died 6 months before he was born so he grew up in his grandfather [[Harboe Meulengracht]]'s house. 15 years old he started an internship in the store of Malthe Conrad Lottrup, a local businessman who among other things owned a sizable brewery. In 1858 he was sent to [[Copenhagen]] to study trade further and in 1862 he started a successful business in [[London]]. However, by 1870 his former mentor Malthe Conrad Lottrup had fallen ill and called Meulengracht home to take over management of Lottrup's [[Ceres Brewery]].&lt;ref name="DSD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/H%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk/Brygger/L._Chr._Meulengracht |title=L.

Meulengracht took over the brewery and managed it through a lifetime. Initially he rationalized and bought new technology in the form of an [[steam engine]]. In the years 1872-88 a large expansion program was undertaken that eventually made Ceres the largest brewery in [[Jutland]] and Meulengracht one of the wealthiest people in Aarhus. Tax records show he paid more in taxes than even contemporary [[Otto Mønsted]] and [[Hans Broge]]. Meulengracht eventually moved into a new home on the Ceres-complex which eventually became a social focal point for the local upper class. As an employer he was known for his ability to make opposing groups work together and privately Meulengracht was active in charity and advocacy work. In 1876 he was elected to the city council and held his seat for 14 years, working in numerous committees particularly on public works and infrastructure. Meulengracht was also one of the forces behind the establishment [[Aarhus Theatre]] and he sat on the first board after it was opened.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSD"/&gt;

Laurits Meulengracht died 9 April 1903, after lengthy illness and during a healing trip to [[Monte Carlo]]. He was buried on [[Nordre Cemetery]] in Aarhus.

== Honors == 
Meulengracht had the official honorary title of ''etatsråd'' and he received the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] and [[Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name="DSD"/&gt;

The '''[[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC)''' is an [[United States|American]] [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]] [[television network]] owned by the [[Disney Media Networks]] subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]], which originated in 1927 as the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]] [[radio network]], and five years after its 1942 divorce from [[NBC]] and purchase by [[Edward J. Noble]] (adopting its current name the following year), expanded into television in April 1948. {{As of|March 2015}}, the network currently has eight [[owned-and-operated station]]s, and current [[network affiliate|affiliation agreements]] with 238 other television stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stations for Network - ABC|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=ABC|work=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehdi Karroubi''' ({{lang-fa|مهدی کروبی|Mehdī Karrūbĩ}}, born 26 September 1937) is an [[Iran]]ian [[Shia]] cleric and [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] [[politician]] leading the [[National Trust Party (Iran)|National Trust Party]]. He was the speaker of the [[Majlis of Iran|parliament]] from 1989 to 1992 and 2000 to 2004, and a presidential candidate in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005]] and [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]].

Following [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]], Karroubi was put under [[house arrest]] in February 2011 – reportedly ordered by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] – without officially being charged, although he is accused of being a "seditionist" and "traitor". As of 2018, he is still confined to his house.&lt;ref name="R"/&gt;

He has been described as a "moderate" with a "mostly rural" base of support.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNewYorker|New Yorker, 13 April 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; Karroubi considers himself a pragmatic reformist and now is one of the leaders of the [[Iranian Green Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/printArticle.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=357975&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17|title=Mousavi and Karoubi set stage for new showdown|newspaper=Gulf Times |date=27 April 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a founding member and former secretary-general of the [[Association of Combatant Clerics]] party. Karroubi is a critic of the [[Guardian Council]] and Iran's Judicial System. By appointment of the [[Supreme Leader]], he was a member of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]] and an adviser, posts he held until resigning from all his posts on 15 June 2005 after the first round of the 2005 presidential election.

==Early life, education, and career==
Mehdi Karroubi is born on 26 September 1937 into a [[Shia]] clerical family in [[Aligudarz]], a city in the western part of [[Lorestan province]].&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; He has a brother, Hassan.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

Karroubi studied theology and Islamic studies at seminaries in [[Qom]] and Tehran. He studied under notable figures such as [[Hossein-Ali Montazeri]] and [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Karroubi was promoted to [[Mujtahid]] on the recommendation of the [[Grand Ayatollah]] [[Yousef Sanei]] and others. He also studied [[theology]] and [[law]] at [[Tehran University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karroubi.ir/biography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522003624/http://www.karroubi.ir/biography.html |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, he became a [[private law|lawyer in economy]], dealing with the investments of prominent businessmen in [[Iran]].

Karroubi was imprisoned several times by the government of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], during the 1970s, including a stint at the [[Qasr Prison]] in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; His wife, Fatemeh, later recalled that she took their second son, Taghi, to meet his father at Qasr Prison for the first time when he was six months old.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

In 1978, Karroubi retired from [[law]] in order to commit to politics. In 1979, he joined the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Karroubi was the head of the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee and the Martyr's Foundation shortly after Iranian revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refIranFocus|iranfocus.com, 14 June 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Karroubi re-entered business after 10 years of emphasis on politics. With eighteen years of experience as a [[solicitor]] beforehand, Karroubi began trading and investing himself.

==Political positions==
===Domestic policies===
During his first term as speaker of Parliament, Karroubi was among the ''maktabi'' or "radical" faction of the majlis who contested the policies of President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]]. While Rafsanjani favored foreign investment and market reforms, Karroubi and others "sought to promote mass political participation and maintain state control of the economy". In fall of 1989 several radical clerics founded the Association of Combatant Clerics of Tehran, which Karroubi headed. Karroubi eventually left this association in 2005 and founded his own party, ''Etemad-e-Melli''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrumberg|Brumberg, p. 162]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, Fatemeh, served as his social affairs advisors when he served as the chairman of the Majlis of Iran from 2000 until 2004.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

Among politicians in the Islamic Republic, he has been one of the leading supporters of civil rights for citizens.&lt;ref name=right_some_wrongs/&gt; Karroubi was long an advocate of women's rights and the presence of women in all social activities. He has been supportive of women taking leadership roles within their political groups.&lt;ref name="right_some_wrongs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/classic/detail.aspx?id=95082&amp;sectionid=3510302|title=No Operation|work=PressTV|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehdi Karroubi, an ethnic [[Lurs|Lur]], supports an approach where all people regardless of their gender, religion, or ethnicity can feel that they are part of Iranian government. He was outspoken in supporting the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. He visited churches, synagogues and [[Zoroastrian]] temples during his time as speaker of Parliament.&lt;ref name="right_some_wrongs"/&gt;

Karroubi is a critic of the [[Guardian Council]] and on numerous occasions wrote letters to the council expressing his concerns. He criticized the nature of the Guardian Council's supervision over the elections, saying in 2009 "I have opposed the notion of 'approbation supervision' power since it was introduced 20 years ago … But, today the problem goes beyond 'approbation supervision'. What goes on today is not 'supervision' at all. Guardian Council inspectors hold absolute authority and control over the elections".&lt;ref name=right_some_wrongs/&gt;

===Foreign policies===
Karroubi and the National Trust Party support the idea of dialogue with the [[United States]] aiming at resolving long standing conflicts. Early after the election of [[Barack Obama]] as US president, Karroubi stated that the changes from the United States have been positive. "An important step has been taken…. I will take steps forward in this relation in accordance with national interests and national pride", he said.&lt;ref name=right_some_wrongs/&gt;

Karroubi has been a critic of President Ahmadinejad's foreign policy and his infamous remarks about the Holocaust. Karroubi said: "The Holocaust is an event which did take place."&lt;ref name="not_underestimated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/features/article_1477152.php/Mehdi_Karroubi_Underdog_but_not_to_be_underestimated__Feature|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216113634/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/features/article_1477152.php/Mehdi_Karroubi_Underdog_but_not_to_be_underestimated__Feature|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 February 2013|title=Mehdi Karroubi: Underdog but not to be underestimated (Feature)|work=Monsters and Critics|date=14 May 2009|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the president's remarks cost Iran a great deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/08/oct/1112.html|title=Iranian Reformist Mehdi Karoubi to Run in 2009 Presidential Race |work=Payvand|date=22 November 2006|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential campaigns==
===2005 presidential campaign===
Karroubi was among the [[Iranian reformists|reformist]] candidates in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|presidential election of 2005]], where he finished third in the vote count, closely following the front runners, ex-president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and Tehran mayor [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. As neither gathered a majority of the vote, a run-off election was held on 24 June 2005, and won by Ahmadinejad.

After the announcement of the election results, Karroubi alleged that a network of [[mosque]]s, the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], and Basij militia forces had been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for Ahmadinejad. He then explicitly alleged that [[Mojtaba Khamenei]], a son of the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ayatollah Khamenei]], was among the conspirators. Ayatollah Khamenei wrote to Karroubi, characterizing these allegations as "below his dignity" and warning that they would "result in a crisis" in [[Iran]], which he would not allow. Karroubi responded in an open letter, resigning from all his political posts, including that as adviser to the Supreme Leader and as a member of [[Expediency Discernment Council]], both of which he had been appointed to by Khamenei. The day after, on 20 June, distribution of the reformist morning newspapers ''[[Eqbal]]'', ''[[Hayat-e No]]'', ''[[Aftab-e Yazd]]'', and ''[[Etemad]]'' were stopped by the prosecutor-general of Tehran, [[Saeed Mortazavi]], for publishing Karroubi's letter, with ''Eqbal'' being completely banned from publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2005/06/050619_mf_hashemi_statement.shtml Election Statement] BBC Persian.&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that Karroubi was subject to house arrest because of his letter.

[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], who ranked first in the first round, also pointed to organized and unjust interventions, alleged manipulation of the vote, and supported Karroubi's complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2005/06/050619_mf_hashemi_statement.shtml|title=Hashemi Rafsanjani's Statement|publisher=BBC|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 presidential election===
Immediately after the 2005 presidential election Karroubi founded [[National Trust Party (Iran)|Etemad-e Melli Party]], and along with it ''Etemad-e Melli'' newspaper. In the 2009 election, he ran as the head of his party. However, many non-party figures also endorsed him.

Karroubi was described as "the best-organized" among the main candidates. He has his own party, his own newspaper and has always followed a clear political stance.&lt;ref name="not_underestimated"/&gt;

He claimed to be the first candidate to announce his candidacy for the presidency. During the last months before the election, he refused a call for him to withdraw in the support of [[Mohammad Khatami]] or later [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]]. After Khatami withdrew from the race in March, Karroubi said "I have neither signed contracts with anyone nor have been promised anything.  Khatami withdrew his candidacy by virtue of his personal decision. In my meeting with Mousavi I persuaded him to join the fray."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91185&amp;sectionid=351020101|title=Karroubi rejects Khatami's request?|work=Press TV|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, both Mousavi and Karroubi stated that a union among reformists would only help Ahamadinejad's reelection, claiming that reformists needed a massive turn out in order to win and that more candidates would advance their interests.

Karroubi publicized his policies by publishing four electoral declarations. According to a paper handed to his supporters during the campaign his main policies are:

# Returning to the planned-based system of governing and using the elite and experts in decision making process
# Organizing financial policies and increasing the effect of national budget
# Protecting human rights and people's privacy
# Improving women's social status
# Nationalizing oil profits
# Supporting NGOs
# Supporting the right of religious or tribal minorities
# Supporting the domination of law and opposing and criticizing illegal behavior
# Supporting the press and free access to the information and internet

In a 2009 interview with the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], Karroubi also promised to expand women's rights if elected president of Iran.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; Among the reforms which he planned to introduce were elimination of [[Guidance Patrol|Iran's morality police street patrols]], which force an Islamic [[dress code]] on Iranian women.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; He questioned mandatory Islamic dress code and proposed that Hijab needs to be optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/pages/?cid=56059|title=آسیب شناسی انتخابات دهم ریاست جمهوری|work=Tabnak|accessdate=30 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726132137/http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/pages/?cid=56059|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His foremost economic program is for broad public ownership of  the national oil and gas companies. According to this plan, adopted from the pro-market economist [[Massoud Nilli]],&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/06/irans-ralph-nader.html|title=The Curious Case of Mehdi Karroubi: Iran's Ralph Nader?|date=3 June 2009|access-date=16 August 2017|work=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; company stock and profits would be shared among Iranians above 18 years of age, without the right to sell. He has predicted that this will add 70000 Tomans a month to every Iranian's income.

His campaign slogan was "Change for Iran", a word visible on his banners and other advertisements.

Former Tehran mayor [[Gholamhossein Karbaschi]] was among the first to endorse him, and was Karroubi's campaign manager. Karroubi has promised to appoint him vice president if elected.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

Karroubi also gained endorsements from journalist [[Abbas Abdi]], now his political advisor, and [[Jamileh Kadivar]], former member of the parliament and his advisor on women's issues. Other notable supporters include: [[Ata'ollah Mohajerani]], historian, politician, journalist, and author and former culture minister during Khatami's presidency; [[Mohammad-Ali Abtahi]], President Khatami's chief of staff, then his Vice President for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, and finally his advisor; [[Mohammad-Ali Najafi]], Iranian politician and university professor and former minister of education; [[Emadeddin Baghi]], the founder and head of the [[Committee for the Defense of Prisoners' Rights]] and the Society of Right to Life Guardians, and winner of the [[Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders]]; [[Abdolkarim Soroush]], philosopher and professor.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

Mehdi Karroubi widely campaigned with his wife, [[Fatemeh Karroubi]], during the campaign, which had previously been an unusual for a politician and his wife in Iran.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; Fatemeh Karroubi additionally served as the head of her husband's campaign in [[Tehran province]] and made separate speeches in support of her husband's candidacy.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; Karroubi's son, Taghi Karroubi, worked as one of his [[campaign manager]]s.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

==Post-election activity==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mousavi and Karroubi.jpg|thumb|left|Karroubi with [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]]]] --&gt;
On 9 August 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible tortures and in particular sexual harassment of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14222321 Iran and human rights: The crackdown] ''Economist''&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to "personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially [[Kahrizak detention center]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/Iran/idUSDAH93169320090819|title=Iran reformer says he wants to present rape evidence|work=Reuters|date=19 August 2009|accessdate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali Larijani]] and [[Sadeq Larijani]] both officially rejected his claims and [[Ali Khamenei]]'s representatives and vice chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9ALTVP00 dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Attacks===
On 8 January 2010, Karroubi's son, Hussein Karroubi reported on Karroubi's Website, Saham News, that shots had been fired at his armored car by pro-government demonstrators in [[Qazvin]]. Demonstrators also threw "bricks and rocks" at the flat where he was staying.&lt;ref name="shots"/&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' newspaper reported that he "has been pushed and shoved" and had a shoe thrown "at him — a grave insult in Iran" — since the election. "But this was the first time someone shot at him."&lt;ref name="shots"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/world/middleeast/09iran.html Shots Fired at Iran Opposition Leader’s Car, Son Says] ''The New York Times'' Nazila Fathi, 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2010, 20 members of the [[Basij]] militia broke into Karroubi's apartment building. They shot at the building, set small fires in the courtyard, the lobby,  vandalized parts of the building, cut water pipes to the apartment and tried to cut power on the street. This was the fourth consecutive night that Karroubi's apartment has come under attack. Karroubi's son, Mohammad Taghi Karroubi, said he heard several of the men say they were there to kill his father. Several of Karroubi's security team were injured when pleading with the gathering to stay outside the building to no avail. The head of a security team protecting Karroubi was in a coma after being beaten, as he tried to talk with a group of attackers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/09/02/iran.karoubi/index.html#fbid=bWTYV6M6pLq&amp;wom=false Iranian opposition leader comes under attack, website says] ''CNN''&lt;/ref&gt;

===House arrest===
In the wake of the [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], Green movement leaders in Iran called for demonstrations on 14 February 2011. The government responded by placing leaders of the movement under [[house arrest]] and on 14 February Iranian state TV broadcast images of "some 50 conservative MPs marching through parliament's main hall" chanting "Death to Mousavi, death to Karroubi".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12462491 Iran unrest: MPs call for death of Mousavi and Karroubi], ''BBC'', 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A statement issued by conservative Iranian parliamentarians carried by the official [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] said: "Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi are corrupts on earth and should be tried." "Corrupt on earth" ([[Mofsed-e-filarz]]) is a capital crime sometimes levied against political dissidents in the Islamic Republic of Iran.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; According to reports, Karroubi, fellow Iranian opposition leader [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]], and their wives [[Fatemeh Karroubi]] and [[Zahra Rahnavard]], were taken from their homes by security forces to [[Heshmatiyeh Prison]] in Tehran in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12599837 Iran: Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi 'arrested'], ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hunger strike ===
On 16 August 2017, Karroubi started a [[hunger strike]] in protest to his [[house arrest]] situation, calling for an [[Public trial|open trial]] and demanding security agents to leave his house.&lt;ref name="R"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-rights-karroubi-idUSKCN1AW1O8?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|title=Iran's detained opposition leader Karroubi starts hunger strike|work=Reuters|author=Bozorgmehr Sharafedin|editor=Jeremy Gaunt|date=16 August 2017|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 79-year-old politician who underwent a heart surgery days earlier was taken to hospital after less than 24 hours and resumed eating after the government agreed to remove intelligence agents from his home. His demand for trial seems not close to be granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/18/iran-reformist-leader-mehdi-karroubi-ends-hunger-strike|title=Iran reformist leader Mehdi Karroubi ends hunger strike|work=The Guardian|date=18 August 2017|access-date=20 August 2017|via=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Karroubi has been married to [[Fatemeh Karroubi]], the daughter of an Aligoudarz [[mercantile]] family, since she was 14.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

'''Mu Sigma''' is an Indian [[management consulting]] firm that primarily offers [[data analytics]] services.  The firm's name is derived from the statistical terms "Mu (μ)" and "Sigma (σ)" which symbolize the [[mean]] and the [[standard deviation]] respectively of a [[probability distribution]]. Mu Sigma is headquartered in [[Bengaluru]] and has a United States branch office in [[Chicago]].

== History ==
Mu Sigma was founded by [[Dhiraj Rajaram]], a former strategy consultant for the India branches of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], in 2004.&lt;ref name="GettingNumbersRight" /&gt; 
In 2008, Mu Sigma raised its first institutional investment round of $30 million from FTVentures (now FTV Capital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FTVentures Commits $30 Million to Mu Sigma (press release) | date = September 24, 2008 | work = FTVentures | url = http://www.ftvcapital.com/newsletters/20081001.html | accessdate = June 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the company raised an additional $25 million from [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date = June 6, 2011 | title = The Daily Start-Up: Sequoia Makes "Big Data" Move With Mu Sigma | work = Venture Capital Dispatch | publisher = [[Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/06/06/the-daily-start-up-sequoia-makes-big-data-move-with-mu-sigma/ | accessdate = June 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the company announced a $108 million round of financing from Sequoia and growth equity investor [[General Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="WSJBigMoney"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mu Sigma Lands Big Money for Big Data |publisher = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203899504577126720815824762 | date = December 29, 2011 | accessdate = Nov 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Mu Sigma received an investment of $45 million from [[MasterCard]], which placed the company over the $1 billion (Rs. 5,400 crore{{efn|At time of transaction}}) milestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-02-20/news/37200522_1_dhiraj-rajaram-mu-sigma-data-analytics | work=The Times Of India | title=Mu Sigma attracts a clutch of foreign investors, gets valued at  billion, Dhiraj Rajaram is now king of data analysis,data science and predictions by  | date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, the company was sued by [[Aon (company)|Aon Corp]] founder [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Pat Ryan]], who discussed that Mu Sigma lowballed its own growth prospects in order to buy back Ryan's stake in the company. Ryan won the court case.&lt;ref name=mehrotra&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mehrotra|first1=Kartikay|title=Aon founder Pat Ryan sues Mu Sigma, claims lowball buyout|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-pat-ryan-mu-sigma-20160310-story.html|accessdate=21 December 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 Dhiraj Rajaram took over the role of CEO from his estranged wife, Ambiga Subramanian, who was currently serving as CEO at the time. The couple split in 2016, post which Dhiraj became the CEO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/unicorn-mu-sigma-founder-dhiraj-rajaram-takes-control-including-role-of-ceofrom-estranged-wife/406130/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inc42.com/buzz/mu-sigma-ambiga-subramanian-social-media-startup-hyphen-social/|title=Mu Sigma’s Ex-CEO Ambiga Subramanian To Roll Out Her Own Social Media Startup Hyphen.Social|date=2017-11-10|work=Inc42 Media|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Oki Kibatarō'''|沖 牙太郎||1848–1906}} was an engineer formerly employed at a Japanese [[Ministry of Industry (Japan)|Ministry of Industry]] (''Kōbushō'') factory. In 1877, only a year after [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s invention, ''Kōbushō'' had started an effort to make telephone receivers by reverse engineering and Oki was in the team that came up with the first prototype.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 1881, convinced that the nation was about to enter the age of communications, Oki founded Meikōsha, which was later renamed [[Oki Electric Industry]].  The company manufactured the first telephones in Japan in 1881, only five years after the device was invented by Bell.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto" /&gt;

The '''Onizuka Prop Wash Award''' recognizes the student at the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|United States Air Force Test Pilot School]] (USAF TPS) who contributed most to class spirit and [[morale]].&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite web |last= Taylor |first=Annamaria |title = TPS class 09A graduates |url= http://www.edwards.af.mil/News/Article/395451/tps-class-09a-graduates/ |publisher=United States Air Force |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The honoree from each class is selected by his or her fellow students rather than by school faculty. The award is named in memory of TPS graduate [[Ellison Onizuka]] who perished in the explosion of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] in 1986.&lt;ref name=TPS50_p220&gt;{{cite book |title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond |publisher=Privately Published |year=1994 |page = 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Prop Wash Award was introduced at the USAF Test Pilot school in 1956. The award takes the form of a wooden [[Propeller (aircraft)|aircraft propellor]] to which plaques bearing the name of each honoree are mounted. ''[[Prop wash#Spiral slipstream|Prop wash]]'' refers to the [[spiral]]-shaped slipstream formed behind a rotating propeller on an [[aircraft]]. The phrase, ''[[Illegitimi non carborundum]]'', a [[Dog Latin|mock-Latin]] [[aphorism]] meaning "Don't let the bastards grind you down" is engraved on the face.&lt;ref name=TPS50_p221/&gt;

The first recipient of the award was Major Joseph W. Rogers from class 56D who would later set a world speed record in the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]].&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web |last=Young |first=James |title=Milestones in Aerospace History at Edwards AFB |url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/afd-080123-063.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418203006/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/afd-080123-063.pdf |archive-date = April 18, 2009 |date=August 2007 |publisher=United States Air Force |accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Onizuka was also a recipient when he graduated from the Test Pilot School with class 74B. After Onizuka's death, the members of his class requested a rededication of the award. The inscription was changed in June 1988 for the graduation of TPS class 87B.&lt;ref name=TPS50_p221/&gt;

{{quote|There is a lot of Ell here always… I thank you all for giving Ell a permanent place here, because (Edwards) is so important in our lives.|Lorna Onizuka, 1990|&lt;ref name=TPS50_p221&gt;{{cite book |title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond |publisher=Privately Published |year=1994 |page = 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6310">In [[business]], '''operating margin'''—also known as '''operating income margin''', '''operating profit margin''', '''EBIT margin''' and '''return on sales''' ('''ROS''')—is the ratio of [[operating income]] ("operating profit" in the  [[United Kingdom|UK]]) to [[Revenue|net sales]], usually presented in percent.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Operating\ margin} = \left ( \frac {\mathrm{Operating\ income}}{\mathrm{Revenue}} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

''[[Net profit]]'' measures the [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of ventures after accounting for all costs.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0137058292}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212100753/http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ |date=2013-02-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Return on sales (ROS)'' is net profit as a percentage of sales [[revenue]]. ROS is an indicator of profitability and is often used to compare the profitability of companies and industries of differing sizes. Significantly, ROS does not account for the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] ([[investment]]) used to generate the profit. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 69 percent responded that they found the "return on sales" metric very useful.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

Unlike [[EBITDA|Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)]] margin, operating margin takes into account depreciation and amortization expenses.  &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

==Purpose==
These financial metrics measure levels and rates of [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]]. How does a company decide whether it is successful or not? Probably the most common way is to look at the [[net profit]]s of the business. Companies are collections of projects and markets, individual areas can be judged on how successful they are at adding to the corporate net profit. Not all projects are of equal size, however, and one way to adjust for size is to divide the profit by sales [[revenue]]. The resulting ratio is return on sales (ROS), the percentage of sales revenue that gets 'returned' to the company as net profits after all the related costs of the activity are deducted.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

==Construction==
Net profit measures the fundamental profitability of the business. It is the revenues of the activity less the costs of the activity. The main complication is in more complex businesses when overhead needs to be allocated across divisions of the company. . . . Almost by definition, overheads are costs that cannot be directly tied to any specific product or division. The classic example would be the cost of headquarters staff.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

'''''Net''' '''profit''': To calculate net profit for a unit (such as a company or division), subtract all costs, including a fair share of total corporate overheads, from the gross revenues.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;
:Net profit ($) = Sales revenue ($) − Total costs ($)

'''''Return on sales (ROS):''' Net profit as a percentage of sales revenue''.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;
:Return on sales (%) = Net profit ($) / Sales revenue ($)

[[EBITDA|Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)]] is a very popular measure of financial performance. It is used to assess the 'operating' profit of the business. It is a rough way of calculating how much cash the business is generating and is even sometimes called the 'operating cash flow'. It can be useful because it removes factors that change the view of performance depending upon the accounting and financing policies of the business. Supporters argue it reduces management's ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company. This metric excludes from consideration expenses related to decisions such as how to finance the business (debt or equity) and over what period they depreciate fixed assets. EBITDA is typically closer to actual cash flow than is [[NOPAT]]. ... EBITDA can be calculated by adding back the costs of interest, depreciation, and amortization charges and any taxes incurred.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt; EBITDA ($) =   Net profit ($) + Interest Payments ($) + Taxes Incurred ($) + Depreciation and Amortization Charges ($)&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Operating\ margin} = \left ( \frac {6,318}{20,088} \right ) = \underline{\underline{31.45 \%}} &lt;/math&gt;

It is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over, before taxes and other indirect costs (such as rent, bonus, interest, ''etc''.), after paying for variable costs of production as wages, raw materials, ''etc''. A good operating margin is needed for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs, such as interest on debt.  A higher operating margin means that the company has less financial risk.

Operating margin can be considered total revenue from product sales less all costs before adjustment for taxes, dividends to shareholders, and interest on debt.

'''Statutory auditor''' is a title used in various countries to refer to a person or entity with an [[audit]]ing role, whose appointment is mandated by the terms of a [[statute]].

==World usage==
{{main|External auditor}}
In [[India]], the term "statutory auditor" refers to an '''[[external auditor]]''' whose appointment is mandated by law. A "statutory audit" is a legally required review of the accuracy of a company's or government's financial records. The purpose of a statutory audit is the same as the purpose of any other audit - to determine whether an organization is providing a fair and accurate representation of its financial position by examining information such as bank balances, bookkeeping records and financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of Statutory Auditors|url=http://www.auditregister.org.uk/Forms/Default.aspx|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] has also made efforts to mandate statutory audits and statutory auditors on an EU-wide level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Paper: The Role, The Position and the Liability of the Statutory Auditor Within the European Union|url=http://europa.eu/documents/comm/green_papers/pdf/com96_338_en.pdf|publisher=European Union|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese usage==

A {{Nihongo|'''statutory auditor'''|監査役|kansayaku}} is an official found in [[Japan]]ese ''[[kabushiki gaisha]]'' (business corporations). Similar roles are also found in [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]], which use modified forms of Japanese [[corporate law]], although the English translation most commonly employed for the role in these countries is '''[[supervisor]]''' or '''[[supervisory board]]'''.&lt;ref name=kansayakukai /&gt;

Statutory [[auditor]]s are elected by shareholders and hold a position in the hierarchy alongside the [[board of directors]]. A kabushiki kaisha must have at least one statutory auditor, unless the transfer of shares is restricted in the [[articles of incorporation]]. If the company is classified as a "large" company (i.e. with more than ¥500 million in [[paid-in capital]] or ¥20 billion in [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]), it must have three statutory auditors, or an audit, compensation and [[nominating committee]] system similar to that used by [[public companies]] in the US.

Statutory auditors have several functions:

# They initiate [[derivative suit]]s against the [[board of directors]] on behalf of the [[shareholder]]s, and represent the company in those suits. This right was once reserved for the auditor; however, following precedent from a recent lawsuit against [[Daiwa Bank]], groups of shareholders can now file suits themselves without going through the auditor.
# In "mid-size" and "large" companies (i.e. with more than ¥100 million of paid-in capital), they have the right to attend board meetings to monitor the directors' actions.
# In "mid-size" companies, they audit the financial reports submitted by the company.
# In "large" companies, they oversee auditing performed by external [[certified public accountant]]s, i.e. [[external auditors]].

Statutory auditors are often selected from among the senior management of the company, or are former directors of related companies (such as suppliers or ''[[keiretsu]]'' partners).

The role of the statutory auditor in Japan is distinct from the role of an [[external auditor]] or [[internal auditor]] as understood in English-speaking countries, which has led to some confusion when discussing their role in internationally prominent cases such as the [[Olympus scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chambers|first=Richard|title=Setting the Record Straight: The Real Internal Auditors at Olympus Have Not Been Implicated|url=http://www.theiia.org/blogs/chambers/index.cfm/post/Setting%20the%20Record%20Straight:%20The%20Real%20Internal%20Auditors%20at%20Olympus%20Have%20Not%20Been%20Implicated|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese association of statutory auditors has recommended adopting the English title "'''audit &amp; supervisory board member'''" to avoid such confusion.&lt;ref name=kansayakukai&gt;{{cite web|title=Background and Goals: New Recommended English translation of "Kansayaku" and "Kansayaku-kai"|url=http://www.kansa.or.jp/en/New_Recommended_English_translation_of_Kansayaku_and_Kansayaku-kai.pdf|publisher=Japan Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Members Association|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steve Bolton''' (born 18 December 1967) is a leading British entrepreneur, [[property]] [[investor]], author&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936100333|title=How to earn 50,000 pounds to 150,000 pounds a year from property investing.|last=Bolton|first=Steve|date=2012|publisher=Platinum Partners Press|year=|isbn=9780956364616|location=|pages=|oclc=936100333|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.performingartistes.co.uk/artistes/851/steve-bolton.htm|title=Performing Artistes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.performingartistes.co.uk|publisher=F4 Group Ltd.|access-date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Bolton/e/B003787UFK|title=Steve Bolton: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle|last=|first=|date=|website=www.amazon.com|publisher=Amazon|access-date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triumphantevents.co.uk/events?access=unleash-influence-nov|title=Unleash Your Power of Influence - November|last=|first=|date=|website=www.triumphantevents.co.uk|publisher=Triumphant Events|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philanthropist. He is the Founder and Executive Chairman of the franchised businesses Platinum Property Partners and Platinum Business Partners.

Bolton’s personal vision is to help as many people as possible to achieve greater wealth, health and happiness and his mission and that of the Platinum companies is to help others be more, do more, have more and give more in life.

==Early life==
The son of a Lancashire miner turned professional footballer (for [[Bournemouth]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Durban City F.C.|Durban City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=249924 |title=The AFCB Vital Hall of Fame - 1945 - 1960 |website=www.bournemouth.vitalfootball.co.uk  |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a French mother (a hairdresser), Bolton was born in [[Bournemouth]], lived in South Africa between the ages of two and five, and then returned to [[Bournemouth]] where he attended Winton Junior and Secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://platinumpropertypartners.co.uk/why-platinum/meet-the-team/|title=Successful investors in property helping you to succeed|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Platinum Property Partners|language=en-US|access-date=21 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/steveboltonppp|title=Steve Bolton {{!}} LinkedIn|last=|first=|date=|website=www.linkedin.com|publisher=LinkedIn Corporation|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early age, with encouragement from his father, Bolton was interested in wealth creation, following [[stocks]] and [[shares]] from the age of eight and writing basic computer programmes with the goal of predicting the outcome of [[Horse racing|horse races]] at the age of 13.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bolton was also exposed to property investment at an early age when his parents purchased a block of 16 flats and converted them into holiday apartments when he was 11 years of age. The family lived in one of the flats and Bolton spent his summer holidays helping his family run the business and working alongside his father as a carpenter's mate.

Bolton attended Winton Boys Secondary school and left aged 16 with no qualifications. After working a variety of jobs including as a kitchen porter and shelf stacker at a local supermarket, Bolton decided to follow his love of sports and the outdoors and accepted an [[apprenticeship]] working in [[outdoor pursuits]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Bolton worked as an outdoor pursuits instructor at the [http://allnatt.co.uk/ Joseph Allnatt] chain of activity centres on the south coast of England where he was quickly promoted to hold the position of head of activities, with 25 staff reporting to him at the age of 19. He was then headhunted in 1992 to help set up and establish Brenscombe Outdoor Pursuits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brenscombeoutdoor.co.uk/|title=Brenscombe Outdoor Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brenscombeoutdoor.co.uk|publisher=|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the most senior member of staff.

==Early career==
Bolton decided in 1994 that he wanted to ‘be his own boss’ and he joined the recently established Ropes Course Developments (RCD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcd.co.uk/index.html|title=Ropes Course Developments - Founder of the European Ropes Course Industry|website=www.rcd.co.uk|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a shareholder and Director.

The company went on to build high and low adventure ropes courses for [[Center Parcs]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[First Choice Holidays]], the [[Royal Air Force]] and many others across Europe and in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Steve-Bolton/30825200|title=Steve Bolton Peace One Day|last=Steve|first=Bolton|date=2013|website=|publisher=Zoom Information|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedge-uk.com/steve_bolton.htm|title=Steve Bolton - Property Expert &amp; Business - Keynote Speaker|last=|first=|date=|work=|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013|via=The Edge-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-founder of a national association and helped to push through safety standards for both the construction and training of ropes courses. These standards were ratified industry-wide and paved the way for the mainstream adoption of high and low ropes courses, which are now commonplace in the UK.

As the business grew, Bolton established Vision Development Training, which operated out of Wokefield Park, now the De Vere Wokefield Estate in Reading. The company provided experiential outdoor personal, management and organisational development programmes for blue chip clients like British Airways, Microsoft and KPMG,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; as well as other high-profile organisations including the British Lions.

In the early 2000’s, Bolton and his partners set up the outdoor activity facilities and businesses, Aerial Extreme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerialextreme.co.uk/|title=Aerial Extreme|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aerialextreme.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Head 4 Heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.head4heights.net/|title=Head 4 Heights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.head4heights.net|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following what he describes in his book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009PPO7MS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1|title=Successful Property Investing: How to Earn £50,000 to £150,000 in Two to Five Years|last=Bolton|first=Steve|date=11 October 2012|publisher=Platinum Partners Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ‘best worst experience’ of his life when the [[Foot and mouth#United Kingdom 2001|2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain]] and the economic fallout that followed the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], meant that the market demand dried up and pushed Ropes Course Developments into liquidation, Bolton had to sell his family home to avoid bankruptcy in early 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bolton decided to exit all business interests related to ropes courses in early 2002.

Still an entrepreneur at heart, Bolton set about starting his first ‘virtual’ business and Mobile Team Challenge Europe (MTC) was formed.  The company became the European distributor for Mobile Team Challenge in America and it imported training equipment from the USA and sold it to clients in the UK and Europe.  MTC was a business where Bolton employed no staff, needed no office premises, never handled the products and was able to work on a very part-time basis by outsourcing most of the work.  The business generated a consistent six figure annual net profit for several years in succession before being sold to an investor.

==Property investing==
Alongside running MTC, Bolton invested significant time and money to learn how to build a robust income stream for himself and his family through investing in property. Two years of very intensive research, learning and development between 2002 and 2004 took him all over the world and he was mentored and taught by the best investors that he could find.

Between 2004 and 2007, Bolton purchased £6 million of residential property and converted most of them into high quality Houses in Multiple Occupancy (HMOs), producing average annual returns of 15% and providing affordable shared homes to 80 tenants.

Having developed his own portfolio, he acted on his accountant's suggestion to develop a franchise, which would enable others to build their own profitable portfolios following his model.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elitebusinessmagazine.co.uk/franchise/item/breaching-the-canopy|title=Breaching the canopy - Elite Franchise Magazine|last=Russel|first=Josh|date=|website=Elite Business Magazine|publisher=CE Media|language=en-gb|access-date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.director.co.uk/magazine/2009/8%20September/partners_63_01.html|title=Director|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Nick Carlisle, Richard Davies and Steve Bolton {{!}} Platinum Property Partners|publisher=Director Publications|language=en-GB|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platinum Property Partners==
Bolton founded and launched Platinum Property Partners on 1 July 2007, with the goal of enabling its Franchise Partners to quickly, safely and successfully build profitable residential property portfolios in the UK, and to create more new and affordable rental homes for key workers and working professionals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PR Log"&gt;{{cite web|last=PR Log|title=Property guru Steve Bolton to speak at the 2011 franchise show in London|url=http://www.prlog.org/11255090-property-guru-steve-bolton-to-speak-at-the-2011-franchise-show-in-london.html|work=PR Log press release distribution|publisher=PR Log|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executives on the Web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Executives on the Web|title=Business Owner / Franchise Partner Franchise in UK|url=http://www.executivesontheweb.com/franchise/request.cfm?opportunity_id=326839|work=Executives on the Web|publisher= ExecutivesOnTheWeb.com 2000–2013|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Money Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Platinum Property Partners, Franchisor, Franchising Opportunities – Making Money Magazine|url=http://www.makingmoney.co.uk/franchise-opportunity/franchisor/platinum-property-partners/business-&amp;-professional-services/|work=Making Money Magazine|publisher=Aceville Publications Ltd|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Franchise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Franchise: New Lease of Life – New Lease of Life|url=https://www.businessfranchise.com/article-page/1569|work=Business Franchise|publisher=Business Franchise Magazine|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Article Dashboard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macall|first=Fiona|title=Interview with Steve Bolton, Multi-millionaire specialising in below market value properties|url=http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/Interview-with-Steve-Bolton-Multi-Millionaire-Specialising-in-Below-Market-Value-Properties/2141170|work=Article Dashboard|publisher=2005 -2011 Article Dashboard|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Franchises"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Day Property Guru Steve Bolton to speak at the Franchise Show in February 2011|url=http://www.sealrez.com/2012/01/Modern-Day-Property-Guru-Steve-Bolton-to-Speak-at-The-Franchise-Show-in-February-2011/|work=Business Franchises|publisher=Business Franchises|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franchise Info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise Info|url=https://www.franchiseinfo.co.uk/franchise-pages/premier/platinumpropertypartners|work=Franchise Info|publisher=Franchise Info|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Start Up TV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Bolton, Platinum Property Partners – Platinum Property Partners|url=http://www.startuptv.co.uk/directory/franchise/ppp/ppp-seminar.html|work=Start Up TV|publisher=The Entrepreneurs Academy|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Accountex&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Bolton – The National Accountancy Exhibition and Conference|url=http://www.accountex.co.uk/speakers/steve-bolton/|work=Accountex|publisher=Prysm BSU Limited|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Bolton - Entrepreneur and successful businessman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Performing Artistes|title=Steve Bolton – Entrepreneur and successful businessman|url=http://www.performingartistes.co.uk/artistes/851/steve-bolton.html|work=Performing Artistes|publisher=F4 Group Ltd|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum Property Partners (known as PPP) has since become the fastest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchiseexpo.co.uk/resources/interview-with-a-ceo/sept/interview-with-ceo-of-platinum-property-partnersppp--steve-bolton|title=Interview with CEO of Platinum Property Partners(PPP)- Steve Bolton|website=www.franchiseexpo.co.uk|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing premium franchise in UK history.

PPP is a successful and socially responsible franchise business that has helped over 250 Franchise Partners (as of January 2017) to source, own, develop and manage more than 800 buy to let properties) with a combined value of £250 million and an annual rent roll in excess of £36 million per annum. This portfolio provides high quality and affordable homes for over 5,000 tenants in over 100 towns, cities and London boroughs in England, Wales, Scotland and Australia.

Tenants who live in PPP properties spend a lower percentage of their income on rent, enabling them to save more of their income each month, thereby accelerating their path onto the property ladder for those that have that goal in mind.

PPP is award-winning and a full member of British Franchise Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebfa.org/members/platinum-property-partners|title=Platinum Property Partners - British Franchise Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum’s Franchise Partners are currently buying and developing property at a rate of around £10 million every three months, creating around 1,000 new rooms for young professionals in shared homes annually.

==Platinum Business Partners==
In 2016 Bolton and his partners expanded the tried, tested and proven Platinum franchising brand and system diversified into ecommerce and became the co-Founder of Platinum Business Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.platinumbusinesspartners.co.uk/|title=Platinum Business Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=Platinum Business Partners|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as PBP), which helps its clients set up their own successful ecommerce businesses. The organisation currently has over 80 Franchise Partners selling more than 300 product lines to 100,000 individual online customers globally.

The business supports it Franchise Partners in sourcing and buying products wholesale from places like China and the USA and then marketing and selling them through retail ecommerce platforms like Amazon, Shopify and others. It also helps existing retail business owners pivot and turn their ‘bricks and mortar’ business, into a ‘bricks and clicks’ business.

Always keen to lead by example, Bolton also formed an ecommerce business in 2016 with two partners and this provides a growing range of dog supplements under the Buddy &amp; Lola brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Buddy-Lola/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_14059711011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=14059711011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Buddy+&amp;+Lola|title=Amazon.com: Buddy &amp; Lola|website=www.amazon.com|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business interests==
Bolton also has interests in residential and commercial property projects. He is a co-founder of Platinum Asset Management, which owns a range of commercial property&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.platinumbusinesscentre.co.uk/|title=Platinum Business Centre - Offices to rent in Bournemouth, office space in Bournemouth, Serviced offices|website=www.platinumbusinesscentre.co.uk|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing inspiring workspaces for small businesses, some retail shops and three hotels in a prime development location in the town centre of Bournemouth. He also has interests in multiple ecommerce businesses.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:The new buildings at the King's Kid orphanage.jpg|thumb|right|The new buildings at the King's Kid orphanage]]
Bolton is a Life Patron of the not-for-profit organisation [[Peace One Day]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For more than a decade he worked with the organisation and helped to raise millions of pounds in funding.

The charity is dedicated to achieving [[International Day of Peace|global ceasefire and non-violence for one day every year on 21 September]] and is ratified by the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 13 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peaceoneday.org/about/impact|title=Impact|newspaper=Peace One Day|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; people are estimated to be acting more peacefully as a result of Peace Day (source McKinsey's).

The organisation has also seen 4.5 million children being vaccinated against polio in previously unreachable areas after Peace One Day ambassador Jude Law travelled to Afghanistan to spearhead a campaign.

During his involvement with Peace One Day from 2007 to 2015, Bolton created and led the Patrons programme where he helped to ensure that the organisation was on a sound financial footing. He also led a project to acquire, fund, purchase and convert offices premises in Richmond, Surrey, which continue to be the headquarters for Peace One Day.

Bolton and his Platinum businesses have also provided funding to the King’s Kid Orphanage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingskidhome.com/our-partners|title=King's Kid Home|website=King's Kid Home|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mitiana, Uganda since 2007. This funding and investment has resulted in the purchase and construction of housing, classrooms, a deep water well, farming land as well as food, teachers’ salaries, secure accommodation for the orphanage director, medical procedures and further education funding for orphanage.  The orphanage is home to 300 children and is self-sustaining.

==Books and speaking==
Bolton’s book, Successful Property Investing, was an Amazon bestseller and has been updated three times since first publication in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Accountex" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lovereading.co.uk/author/Steve-Bolton,-Nick-Carlile/gd/Steve-Bolton-Nick-Carlile.html|title=Steve-Bolton,-Nick-Carlile Books, Ebooks and Recommendations.

He is also a [[keynote]] speaker&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triumphantevents.co.uk/events?access=pod-gettingabove|title=Triumphant Events POD Talks {{!}} Getting above the Noise|last=|first=|date=|website=www.triumphantevents.co.uk|publisher=|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; having spoken on stages alongside Richard Reed (Innocent), Simon Woodroffe (YO!), James Caan (Dragons Den), Kriss Akabussi (World Champion athlete), Davina McCall, Ben Fogle, Michael Gerber (Emyth) and many others.

His primary keynote talk is ‘Standing on the Shoulders of Giants’ which promotes the core concept Bolton believes in passionately - ‘everyone should have a mentor’.

Bolton also speaks regularly and for free at local schools and universities on the subject of wealth, health and happiness, as well as entrepreneurship, principles of success and personal development. He is passionate about inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs.

==Axe the tenant tax==
In 2016 Bolton co-founded and continues to lead a grassroots not-for-profit campaign called Axe the Tenant Tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tenanttax.co.uk|title=Axe the Tenant Tax|newspaper=Tenant Tax|language=en-US|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a UK first, Bolton united the private rented sector by forming a Coalition of all of the major organisations who are opposed to new government legislation that restricts landlords’ ability to deduct mortgage finance costs as a business expense. Coalition stakeholders represent more than 100,000 landlords who provide housing to more than 1 million tenants in the UK.

Bolton and fellow landlord Chris Cooper were co-claimants in a Judicial Review against the UK government in relation to the legality of Section 24 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015. Their legal team was led by Cherie Blair CBE QC and their legal challenge campaign broke two legal crowdfunding records in 2016 by raising over £200,000 within the fastest recorded timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crowdjustice.org/case/clause24/|title=Alice in Wonderland Tax Grab|newspaper=CrowdJustice|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crowdjustice.org/case/tenanttax/|title=Landlords Fight Back #TenantTax|newspaper=CrowdJustice|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been covered in hundreds of media articles, and Bolton has met the housing Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and MPs. Bolton believes the tax is a disaster for the UK housing market and is championing the cause for the small landlords and tenants who will suffer badly if this tax comes into force.

Their Judicial Review was thwarted at the High Court on 6 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/06/landlords-lose-legal-challenge-buy-to-let-tax-changes-cherie-booth|title=Landlords lose legal challenge over buy-to-let tax changes|last=Jones|first=Rupert|date=2016-10-06|last2=Collinson|first2=Patrick|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolton and Cooper have since focussed their campaign efforts on lobbying the UK government and working with MPs and Tenant Tax coalition members to get the government to do a U-turn.

==Mentoring==
For six years Bolton was a mentor for the Key Person of Influence programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dent.global/team/|title=Our Team - Dent Global|newspaper=Dent Global|language=en-US|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentoring several thousand entrepreneurs and business owners during that time in a group setting.

Bolton provides high impact one to one mentoring to multi-millionaires, celebrities and global change-makers. His mentoring efforts in recent years have focussed around ‘mentoring the mentors’ and all of the Platinum franchise businesses have at their core, a one to one mentoring approach that the Platinum team deliver.

==Media appearances==
Bolton and his businesses have been featured on a number of TV programmes and in media outlets including BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ml5f7 |title=Home Under the Hammer, Series 16, Episode 33 |work=BBC One|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel Four,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/59622-001 |title=Dispatches - The British Property Boom|work=Channel 4 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky News, Financial Times, Sunday Times, The Telegraph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/buy-to-let/cherie-booth-challenge-to-buy-to-let-tax-not-over-yet-despite-ju/ |title=Cherie Booth: Challenge to buy-to-let tax 'not over yet' despite judicial review failure  |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=7 October 2016|first=Olivia|last=Rudgard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/cherie-blair-represent-landlords-changes-tax-regime |title=Cherie Booth to represent landlords fighting changes to tax regime |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2016|first=Matthew|last=Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Express, the Mail and many trade publications in the franchise, entrepreneur, property and business sectors.

He is often quoted in national media in relation to franchising, property, entrepreneurship and mentoring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36044">'''Stress management''' is a wide spectrum of techniques and [[psychotherapy|psychotherapies]] aimed at controlling a person's level of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], especially [[chronic stress]], usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or [[distress (medicine)|distress]] in the terminology advocated by [[Hans Selye]], rather than what he calls [[eustress]], a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise.

Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | title=Stress Management: What can you do? | publisher=St. Louis Psychologists and Counseling Information and Referral | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | author=Paul Susic MA Licensed Psychologist Candidate | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124092537/http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | archivedate=January 24, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.

Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in [[polygraph]]s.

Many practical stress management techniques are available, some for use by [[health professional]]s and others, for [[self-help]], which may help an individual reduce their levels of stress, provide positive feelings of control over one's life and promote general [[well-being]]. Other stress reducing techniques involve adding a daily exercise routine, finding a hobby, writing your thoughts, feelings, and moods down and also speaking with a trusted one about what is bothering you. It is very important to keep in mind that not all techniques are going to work the same for everyone, that is why trying different stress managing techniques is crucial in order to find what techniques work best for you. An example of this would be, two people on a roller coaster one can be screaming grabbing on to the bar while the other could be laughing while their hands are up in the air (Nisson). This is a perfect example of how stress effects everyone differently that is why they might need a different treatment. These techniques do not require doctors approval but seeing if a doctors technique works better for you is also very important. 

Evaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in [[psychotherapy]], while others with less evidence favoring them are considered [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]].  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.

There are several [[Scientific modelling|model]]s of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress.  Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.

==Historical foundations==
[[Walter Cannon]] and [[Hans Selye]] used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, W. (1939). The Wisdom of the Body, 2nd ed., NY: Norton Pubs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Selye, H| year=1950| title=Stress and the general adaptation syndrome| journal=Br. Med. J.| volume=1| pages=1383–92| pmid=15426759| issue=4667| pmc=2038162| doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4667.1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established the view that stress is caused by distinct, measurable life stressors, and further, that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale]]). Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.

==Models==

The generalized models are:
* [[Fight-or-flight response|The emergency response/fight-or-flight response]] by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)
* [[Stress_(biology)#General_adaptation_syndrome|General Adaptation Syndrome]] by Hans Selye (1936)
* Stress Model of Henry
* Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)
* [[Conservation of resources theory|Theory of resource conservation]] by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll &amp; Buchwald, 2004)

===Transactional model===
[[File:Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]
[[Richard Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman suggested in 1981 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an "imbalance between demands and resources" or as occurring when "pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R.S., &amp; Folkman, S. (1984). Stress, Appraisal and Coping. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:
* Conflicts in company
* The way employees are treated by their bosses/supervisors or company
* Lack of job security
* Company policies
* Co-workers who don't do their fair share
* Unclear expectations
* Poor communication
* Not enough control over assignments
* Inadequate pay or benefits
* Urgent deadlines
* Too much work
* Long hours
* Uncomfortable physical conditions
* Relationship conflicts
* Co-workers making careless mistakes
* Dealing with rude customers
* Lack of co-operation
* How the company treats co-workers&lt;ref&gt;Somaz, Wenk Heidi &amp; Tulgan, Bruce (2003). Performance Under Pressure: Managing Stress in the Workplace.Canada. HRD Press Inc.p 7-8. {{ISBN|0-87425-741-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to develop an effective stress management program it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress, and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate [[coping skills]], then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressor. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressor and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of types of stressors.

===Health realization/innate health model===
The health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of [[Well being|well-being]] results from approaching the world with a "quiet mind".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, R.C. (1995). ''Realizing Mental Health: Toward a new Psychology of Resiliency.'' Sulberger &amp; Graham Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-945819-78-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedgeman, J.A. (2005). Health Realization/Innate Health: Can a quiet mind and a positive feeling state be accessible over the lifespan without stress-relief techniques? Med. Sci. Monitor 11(12) HY47-52. {{cite web |url=http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?IDMAN=8224 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925220423/http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?IDMAN=8224 |archivedate=2012-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought—especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings—will reduce their stress.

==Techniques==
High demand levels load the person with extra effort and work. A new [[time management|time schedule]] is worked up, and until the period of abnormally high, personal demand has passed, the normal frequency and duration of former schedules is limited.

Many techniques [[Coping skill|cope]] with the stresses life brings. Some of the following ways reduce a lower than usual stress level, temporarily, to compensate the [[biological]] issues involved; others face the [[stressor]] at a higher level of abstraction:

===Stress prevention and resilience===
Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress, considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to [[Psychological resilience|psychological resilience-building]].  A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring stress===
Levels of stress can be measured. One way is through the use of psychological testing: ''The [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]]'' [two scales of measuring stress] is used to rate stressful life events, while the [[DASS (psychology)|DASS]] [Depression Anxiety Stress Scales] contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in [[blood pressure]] and [[galvanic skin response]] can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A [[digital thermometer]] can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the [[fight-or-flight response]] drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual.  This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.

===Effectiveness===
Stress management has physiological and immune benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bower, J.

==Types of stress==

===Acute stress===
Acute stress is the most common form of stress among humans worldwide.

Acute stress deals with the pressures of the near future or dealing with the very recent past. This type of stress is often misinterpreted for being a negative connotation. While this is the case in some circumstances, it is also a good thing to have some acute stress in life. Running or any other form of exercise is considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.&lt;ref name=acute&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGonagle|first=Katherine|author2=Ronald Kessler |title=Chronic Stress, Acute Stress, Depressive Symptoms|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=October 1990|volume=18|issue=5|pages=681–706|doi=10.1007/BF00931237|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44026/1/10464_2004_Article_BF00931237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic stress===
[[Chronic stress]] is unlike acute stress. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time. Chronic stress can lead to memory loss, damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. The severity varies from person to person and also gender difference can be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can but once males hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increases drastically.&lt;ref name=hormones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Rachel|title=Chronic Stress Effects on Memory: Sex differences in performance|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=January 2003|volume=43|issue=1|pages=48–59|doi=10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00022-3|last2=Beck|first2=Kevin D|last3=Luine|first3=Victoria N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace==
Stress in the workplace is a commonality throughout the world in every business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Managing that stress becomes vital in order to keep up [[job performance]] as well as relationship with co-workers and employers.&lt;ref name=Dailybsness.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310012706/http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress. However, each person is different and some people like the pressure to perform better.

Salary can be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Cultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|title=Workplace Stress Management Resource - OFAI|author=|date=|website=www.ofai.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327200411/http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|archivedate=2016-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[therapy]], communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|title=Avoiding change-induced stress in the workplace  — Nordic Labour Journal|first=|last=lars|date=|website=www.nordiclabourjournal.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824145833/http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|archivedate=2013-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical environment===

A study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming the large number of medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.&lt;ref name=caplan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caplan|first=R.P|title=Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Hospital Consultants, General Practitioners, and Senior Health Managers|journal=BMJ|date=November 1994|volume=309|pages=1261–1269|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6964.1261|issue=6964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress management programs===
Many businesses today have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipments adapting to stress at the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Anti stress diary with adult coloring pages|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515213919/https://coloringnotebook.com/|archivedate=2017-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress relieving gadgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|title=20 Gadgets to Help You Fight Stress - Hongkiat Magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062941/http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses today try to alleviate stress on their employees. One way is individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors in the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them in any way. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.

[[Employee assistance programs]] can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individual stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz&amp;Schultz|first=D|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances of lots of stress is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.

Intervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Sally|title=Occupational Stress: Personal &amp; Professional Approaches|year=1998|publisher=Stanley Thornes ltd.|location=United Kingdom|pages=18–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation industry===
Aviation is a [[Stress in the aviation industry|high-stress industry]], given that it requires a high level of precision at all times.  Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease performance and compromise safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldring|first1=Michael|date=1996-03-15|title=Human Factors Module: Stress|journal=European organisation for the safety of air navigation|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/field_tabs/content/documents/nm/safety/safety-human-factors-module-stress-1996.pdf|volume=1|pages=3–16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131033/https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/field_tabs/content/documents/nm/safety/safety-human-factors-module-stress-1996.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be effective, stress measurement tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other [[stressor]]s.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Stress measurement in aviation seeks to quantify the [[psychological stress]] experienced by [[aviator]]s, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators' [[coping skills|coping]] and stress management skills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehrer |first1=P |last2=Karavidas |first2=M |last3=Lu |first3=SE |last4=Vaschillo |first4=E |last5=Vaschillo |first5=B |last6=Cheng |first6=A |date=May 2010 |title=Cardiac data increase association between self-report and both expert ratings of task load and task performance in flight simulator tasks: An exploratory study |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=80–7 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2010.02.006 |pmid=20172000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To more precisely measure stress, aviators' many responsibilities are broken down into "workloads."  This helps to categorise the broad concept of "stress" by specific stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=M|last2=Picardi|first2=A|date=1999|title=Psychological stress and neuroendocrine function in humans: The last two decades of research|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|volume=68|issue=3|pages=114–50|doi=10.1159/000012323|pmid=10224513}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method may be more effective than measuring stress levels as a whole.  Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.

To evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used.  The major types of measurement tools are:
# Performance-based measures;
# [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and
# [[Physiological]] measures, like measurement of heart rate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Implementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Measurement systems====
The most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily [[rating scale]]-based.  These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry.  Different systems may be utilised in different operational specialties.

* The [[Perceived Stress Scale]] (PSS) – The PSS is a widely used subjective tool for measuring stress levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langan-Fox |first=J |last2=Sankey |first2=M |last3=Canty |first3=JM |date=October 2009 |title=Human factors measurement for future air traffic control systems |journal=Human Factors |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=595–637 |doi=10.1177/0018720809355278 |pmid=20196289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how stressed they felt after a certain event.  All 10 questions are summed to obtain a total score from 0 to 40.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  In the aviation industry, for example, it has been used with flight training students to measure how stressed they felt after flight training exercises.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirschner|first1=J|last2=Young|first2=J|last3=Fanjoy|first3=R|date=2014|title=Stress and coping as a function of experience level in collegiate flight students|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jate/vol3/iss2/3/|journal=Journal of Aviation Technology and Engineering|volume=3|issue=2|pages=14–19|doi=10.7771/2159-6670.1092|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528192713/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jate/vol3/iss2/3/|archivedate=2016-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Coping Skills Inventory – This inventory measures aviators' skills for coping with stress.  This is another subjective measure, asking participants to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which they use eight common coping skills:&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; [[Substance abuse]], Emotional support, Instrumental support (help with tangible things, like child care, finances, or task sharing), Positive reframing (changing one's thinking about a negative event, and thinking of it as a positive instead), Self-blame, Planning, Humour and Religion. An individual's total score indicates the extent to which he or she is using effective, positive coping skills (like humor and emotional support); ineffective, negative coping skills (like substance abuse and self-blame); and where the individual could improve.
* The Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) – SWAT is a rating system used to measure individuals' perceived mental workload while performing a task, like developing instruments in a lab, multitasking aircraft duties, or conducting air defense.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corwin |first=W.H. |date=1992-04-01 |title=In-flight and post flight assessment of pilot workload in commercial transport aircraft using the subjective workload assessment technique |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1?journalCode=hiap20 |journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=77–93 |doi=10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SWAT combines measurements and scaling techniques to develop a global rating scale.

====Pilot stress report systems====
Early pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Young, James |date=December 2008 |title=The Effects of Life-Stress on Pilot Performance |url=http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |pages=1–7 |docket= |accessdate= |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152852/http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale.  Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress.  The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots' retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Muller, Ronald |editor2=Andreas Wittmer |editor3=Christopher Drax |date=2014 |title=Aviation Risk and Safety Management: Methods and Applications In Aviation Organizations |url= |location= |publisher=Springer International |page= |isbn=978-3-319-02779-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for [[U.S. Naval]] aviators in 1982 to test the [[hypothesis]] that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics. After completing the questionnaire, the test group is divided into two groups: "at-fault" with mishap, and "not-at-fault" in a mishap. Then, questionnaires from these two groups were analyzed to examine differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=O'Connor, Paul E. |editor2=Cohn, Joseph V. |date=2010 |title=Human Performance Enhancement in High-Risk Environments: Insights, Developments, and Future Directions from Military Research |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page= |isbn=978-0-313-35983-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of British commercial airline pilots, conducted by Sloan and Cooper (1986), surveyed 1,000 pilot members from the [[British Airline Pilots' Association]] (BALPA).  They used a modified version of Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor's questionnaire to collect data on pilots'  perceptions of the relationship between stress and performance.  Being a subjective measure, this study's data was based on pilots' perceptions, and thus rely on how accurately they recall past experiences their relationships to stress.  Despite relying on subjective perceptions and memories, the study showed that pilot reports are noteworthy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Beck Depression Inventory]] (BDI) is another scale used in many industries, including the mental health professions, to screen for [[depression (mood)|depressive]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barralabc |first=C |last2=Rodríguez-Cintasb |first2=L |last3=Martínez-Lunaabc |first3=Nieves |last4=Bachillerabc |first4=D |date=2014-11-13 |title=Reliability of the Beck Depression Inventory in opiate-dependent patients |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14659891.2014.980859 |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–6 |doi=10.3109/14659891.2014.980859|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Parsa and Kapadia (1997) used the BDI to survey a group of 57 [[U.S. Air Force]] [[fighter pilot]]s who had flown combat operations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The adaptation of the BDI to the aviation field was problematic.  However, the study revealed some unexpected findings.  The results indicated that 89% of the pilots reported insomnia; 86% reported irritability; 63%, dissatisfaction; 38%, guilt; and 35%, loss of [[libido]].  50% of two [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s and 33% of another squadron scored above 9 on the BDI, suggesting at least low levels of depression.  Such measurement may be difficult to interpret accurately.{{why?|date=December 2015}}

A '''teal organisation''' is an emerging organisational [[paradigm]] that advocates a level of [[consciousness]] including all previous [[world view]]s within the operations of an [[organization|organisation]]. The concept of teal organisation refers to the next stage in the evolution of [[consciousness]] and was introduced in 2014 by [[Frederic Laloux]] in his book on [[Reinventing Organizations]].&lt;ref name="lalouxfred-book"&gt;{{cite book  | title= Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness |url= http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/ | location = |last= Laloux   |first =  Frederic |date = 2014 | publisher = Nelson Parker |page= 381 |isbn= 978-2960133509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stratbusy&gt;{{cite web|title= The Future of Management Is Teal |url= https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921 |website= Strategy + Business  |date= July 6, 2015  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rests on previous studies done by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] and [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] including [[Jean Gebser]], [[Clare W. Graves]], [[Don Edward Beck]], Chris Cowan and [[Ken Wilbur|Ken Wilber]] who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html "Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap"], by Clare W.

== Overview ==
A teal organisation transcends and integrates the existing limitations of current static organisational paradigms including Amber, Orange and Green organisations.&lt;ref name=huffpost1&gt;{{cite news  |title= Reinventing Management, Part 1: What Color Is Your Organization?  |url=  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/great-work-cultures/reinventing-management-pa_b_9387286.html  |newspaper= [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] |last=  Collins  |first= Rod   |date= March 4, 2016 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by three [[Epiphany (feeling)|breakthroughs]] in human [[collaboration]], specific to this evolutionary level: ''self-management'' suggests a system based on peer relationships with no need for hierarchy, consensus, nor central command and control; ''wholeness'' is about a consistent set of practices that invite members to reclaim their inner wholeness and bring on the workplace “all of who they are”;&lt;ref name=futureconsid1&gt;{{cite web |title= What does Wholeness mean in the context of Teal Organising? |url= https://futureconsiderations.com/wholeness-in-the-context-of-teal/  |website=  Future Considerations |date= July 7, 2015 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''evolutionary purpose'' introduces a teal organisation as a living [[organism]] with a direction of its own where its members are invited to listen and take note of the purpose it wants to serve. These breakthroughs overcome the limitations of  previous organisational models in that they welcome the emotional, intuitive, and spiritual elements in lieu of the usual display of rationality, determination and strength; and concealment of doubts or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Most Dangerous Notion in "Reinventing Organizations"  |url=  https://medium.com/@jessicajprentice/the-most-dangerous-notion-in-reinventing-organizations-9032930295e2  |date= July 6, 2015 |publisher= [[Medium (website)|Medium Corporation]] |author= Jessica Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its evolution, a teal organisation exhibits properties similar to [[complex adaptive system]]s because the interactions and relationships between its elements are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] and based on few simple rules or guiding principles. These elements learn from the past and their immediate environment and then adapt accordingly for the survival of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Andersson |first= Malin|date= 2015 |title=Exploring the latest paradigm shift in organizational consciousness development, by using the framework from Reinventing Organizations |type= Master thesis|chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.835.4680&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of notable organisations around the world has adopted and operates on the teal organisation model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  The Design Principles evolve "naturally" in the workplace and the need for a scientific foundation |url= https://www.prosocial.world/post/the-design-principles-evolve-naturally-in-the-workplace-and-the-need-for-a-scientific-foundation  |publisher= Prosocial World |date= June 2, 2017 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[The Morning Star Company]] (food processing, United States),&lt;ref name=morningself&gt;{{cite web|title= The Morning Star Company - Self-Management |url= http://morningstarco.com/index.cgi?Page=Self-Management  |website=  morningstarco.com |date=  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]]  (apparel, United States), [[Sounds True]] (media, United States), AES  (energy sector, international), [[Buurtzorg Nederland]] (health care, Netherlands), ESBZ ([[K–12]] school, Germany), Heiligenfelde  (mental health hospitals, Germany), [[Nucor]] (steel manufacturing, international).

'''Women's work''' or '''woman's work''' is [[Manual labour|work]] believed to be exclusively the domain of women and associates particular tasks with the [[female]] gender. It is particularly used with regard to work that a mother or wife will perform within a family and household. (See [[Division_of_labour#Gendered_division_of_labour|gendered division of labour]].)
Related concepts include [[gender role]], [[wage labour]] and [[employment]], female [[workforce]], and [[women's rights]] (cf. [[Gender role#Gender roles and feminism|Gender roles and feminism]]). The term may be [[pejorative]], when applied to [[men]] performing roles which are largely designated for women. 

The term "women's work" may indicate a role with children as defined by [[nature]] in that only women are biologically capable of performing them: [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[breastfeeding]]. It may also refer to professions that involve these functions: [[midwife]] and [[wet nurse]]. "Women's work" may also refer to roles in [[raising children]] particularly within the home: [[diaper]] changing and related [[hygiene]], [[toilet training]], [[bathing]], clothing, feeding, monitoring, and education with regard to [[personal care]]. It may also refer to professions that include these functions such as that of: [[teacher]] (up to the age of puberty), [[governess]], [[nanny]], [[day care]] worker, and [[au pair]]. "Women's work" may also refer to roles related to [[housekeeping]] such as: [[cooking]], [[sewing]], [[ironing]], and '''cleaning'''.  It may also refer to professions that include these functions such as: [[maid]] and [[cook (domestic worker)|cook]]. Though much of "women's work" is indoors, some is outdoors such as: fetching water, [[grocery]] shopping or food [[foraging]], and [[gardening]]. 

By contrast, "men's work" involves the usage of [[Physical strength|strength]] or work outdoors, also considered macro power which is defined as public sphere power; mechanical, electrical or electronic knowledge and skill; employment ("bread-winning", "bringing home the bacon"); most dealings with money; or higher reasoning to perform tasks. The term micro power refers to men having greater power in the home; which means that it is easier for men to avoid house work and care labor. Micro power may also be a tool men use to prevent women from entering the workforce. When women are kept in the private sphere, men remain the sole provider financially, which provides headway in American society. Among some people, men's work is considered to be the opposite of "women's work" and thus does not include activities within the home or with children, though "men's work" traditionally includes work that involves both (such as repairing appliances and disciplining children).
