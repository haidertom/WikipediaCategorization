      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">'''Aphelia''' (Greek, "plainness") is a rhetorical term that refers to the plainness of writing or speech.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, Richard A. ''A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms''. 2nd ed. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to explain or teach rather than to entertain or elicit an emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. "A Catalogue of Rhetorical and Other Literary Terms from American Literature and Oratory." ''Style'' 22 Dec. 1997: n. pag. Web. 29 Sep. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The sentence structure is typically both short in length and lacks "poetic and rhetorical adornment." &lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 139. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parataxis]] and [[asyndeton]] are also expected within the plain style. Writing or speech using aphelia may display a "right-branching" sentence structure for the most part; that is, the sentence will begin with an [[independent clause]] that will be followed by at least one [[dependent clause]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 138. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*"In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar." — [[Herman Melville]], [[Moby-Dick]]
*"I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, but chuckled at heart." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Tell-Tale Heart]]
*"She presented all of the ordinary appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Premature Burial]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4272">In [[machine learning]], '''Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS)''', Bayesian Programs write (synthesize) new Bayesian programs.  This is in contrast to the field of [[Probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programs]] where humans write new probabilistic (Bayesian) programs.

[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian probabilities]] is a strategy to learn distributions over Bayesian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603542/ai-software-juggles-probabilities-to-learn-from-less-data/|title=AI Software Juggles Probabilities to Learn from Less Data|last=Knight|first=Will|date=|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian Program Synthesis can be compared to the work on Bayesian Program Learning by Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum's,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where probabilistic program components were hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=Brenden M.|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Joshua B.|date=2015-12-11|title=Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1332|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1332–1338|doi=10.1126/science.aab3050|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==
Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0216/Startup-pairs-man-with-machine-to-crack-the-black-box-of-neural-networks|title=Startup pairs man with machine to crack the 'black box' of neural networks|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=2017-02-16|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy allows more automatic synthesis of new programs via inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. 

The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robohub.org/talking-machines-probabilistic-programming-with-ben-vigoda/|title=Talking Machines: Probabilistic programming, with Ben Vigoda {{!}} Robohub|website=robohub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian methods and models are frequently used to incorporate prior knowledge. When good prior knowledge can be incorporated into a Bayesian model, effective inference can often be performed with much less data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ais-factions-get-feisty-really-theyre-team/|title=AI’s Factions Get Feisty. But Really, They’re All on the Same Team|last=Metz|first=Cade|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework can be also be contrasted with the family of automated [[program synthesis]] fields, including program synthesis, [[programming by example]], and [[programming by demonstration]]. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian Program Synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Beijing Forestry University was founded as the Forestry Department of the [[Imperial University of Peking]] in 1902. In 1952, it had become an institute and was renamed as Beijing Institute of Forestry. In 1985, it was renamed as Beijing Forestry University, and it started to focus on a wide range of new subjects, including [[Electronics]], [[Computer Science]], [[Psychology]], [[Economics]], etc. Now it has 14 schools providing more than 60 undergraduate taught programs, more than 120 postgraduate master programs and more than 40 Ph.D. programs to students.

== Schools ==
The university has 14 schools:
* School of '''Art'''
* School of '''Biological Sciences and Biotechnology'''
* School of '''Economics and Management'''
* School of '''Environmental Science and Engineering'''
* School of '''Foreign Languages'''
* School of '''Forestry'''
* School of '''Humanities and Social Sciences'''
* School of '''Information Science and Technology'''
* School of '''Landscape Architecture'''
* School of '''Material Science and Technology'''
* School of '''Nature Conservation'''
* School of '''Science'''
* School of '''Soil and Water Conservation'''
* School of '''Technology'''

== Faculty ==
Since its establishment over 50 years ago, more than 30,000 Chinese and a number of foreign students have graduated from Beijing Forestry University. Of that number, 11 have attained the position of [[academician]]. The university faculty consists of 956 full-time teachers, including five academicians and 496 full and associate professors. While upholding traditional disciplines, the university has also established a large number of new disciplines to meet society's needs. The university consists of 15 schools; the [[graduate school]], [[biological science]] and technology, [[landscape architecture]], [[forestry]], [[environmental science]] and engineering, [[soil and water conservation]], industry, [[information science]], [[material science and technology]], [[science]], [[Conservation movement|conservation]], economic management, [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], [[foreign languages]], [[vocational training]] and [[continuing education]].

The university features a computer center, a computer network center, an educational center, an audio-visual teaching center, a biological center, a micro-technology center, a forest-organism center and a tree farm for teaching and research (the Jiu Feng National Forest Park). Attached to the university are the Foreign-Language Training Center of the State Forestry Administration, the Research Center of Soil Control Technology of Loess Plateau in China and the Training Center of Desertification Control of China. BFU is a well-equipped institution, featuring the Central Building of Teaching, a gymnasium, laboratories, and a high-speed campus network. A computerized checking system exists for library books, and also in the library building is the Imported Teaching Materials Center for forestry universities and colleges nationwide. Construction of a high-rise student apartment building and a new classroom building was completed in 2001.

In recent years, nearly 200 discoveries in scientific research received awards from national, provincial and ministerial authorities, and more than 20 achievements of teaching were rewarded by the national and municipal governments. BFU is engaged in international academic exchanges and cooperation with more than 150 universities and research institutions in over 20 countries, providing opportunities for contacts between China and the outside world in the fields of forestry and environmental studies.

BFU provides an atmosphere for teaching and learning, combining the acquisition of professional knowledge with an improvement of all-round abilities (with an emphasis on forging a rigorous, creative academic style). Systems of optional courses, subsidiary courses, course exemption, and bachelor-to-master continuing education have been established so students may develop according to their own interests and desires. The university also offers extracurricular activities to enrich campus life; these are organized by student societies and associations in fields including science and technology, art, sports, environmental protection, and politics. Some groups have become influential, including the Society of Scientific Exploration and Wilderness Survival and the Association of Beijing College Volunteers for Environmental Protection. The former received the Prize of the Earth, the top prize from the National Bureau of Environmental Protection. In recent years, BFU students of BFU won four consecutive prizes at the College Students' Landscape Gardening Architecture Design Competitions (sponsored by UNESCO and the International Association of Landscape Gardening Architects), the Golden Prize in International College Students' Architecture Design and prizes in garden-design competitions. Achievements were also earned in domestic competitions for scientific inventions, mathematics, and art.

==Notable people==
Notable alumni include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3005">A '''broadcast auxiliary service''' or '''BAS''' is any [[radio frequency]] system used by a [[radio station]] or [[TV station]], which is not part of its direct [[broadcasting|broadcast]] to listeners or viewers.  These are essentially internal-use [[backhaul (telecom)|backhaul]] channels not intended for actual [[Television reception|reception]] by the public, but part of the [[airchain]] required to get those signals to such a [[transmitter (radio)|transmitter]].

Examples include:
*[[studio/transmitter link]] (STL)
*[[transmitter/studio link]] (TSL)
*[[remote pickup unit]] (RPU)
*[[electronic news gathering]] (ENG)

Several of these bands exist, but the most frequently used band is the 2GHz [[microwave]] BAS band for point-to-point transmission from mobile newsgathering units to mountaintop receivers.

Seven 12-MHz wide channels exist in the band. In North America, DVB-T. precisely the same modulation technique as European Broadcast, is used, using a constellation of QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM, enabling sufficient digital bandwidths at 6MHz deviation for transmission of an MPEG transport stream at 10 or more megabits per second, producing three "lower", "center", and "upper" overlapping 6MHz channels within each 12MHz channel.
[[File:BAS-2018.png|center|frameless|800x800px|2GHz FCC Band Plan with 6MHz Subdivisions]]

==2GHz relocation==
In the [[United States]] between 2005 and 2010, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) moved [[TV channel]]s in the 2 GHz TV BAS band at the request of [[Sprint Nextel]], so that it could use a portion which was adjacent to [[personal communications services|PCS]] frequencies it already uses.  The [[report and order]] resulting from this [[rulemaking]] specified that Sprint/Nextel must pay for every TV station using the band to buy and install new BAS equipment to work in the new band structure.

Previously, there had been seven [[analog TV]] channels, each 17 or 18 MHz wide, between 1990 and 2110 MHz.  The new allocation created seven [[digital TV]] channels, each 12 MHz wide, from 2025.5 to 2109.5 MHz.  (There was also a "narrowed in place" [[bandplan]] used as an [[interim]] measure, as the two bands overlap.)&lt;br /&gt;
Begun in 2005, the relocation was 94% complete as of October 2008, and was expected to be fully complete in mid 2009.  After multiple extensions granted by the FCC, it was finally done in July 2010, with the completion of the [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]] [[TV market]].  

The cleared band is now used for PCS, [[List of AWS-1 devices|AWS]], and [[mobile satellite service|MSS]] services, including [[mobile broadband]].

It is situated in [[Piscadera Bay]], {{convert|25|m}} from the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Its education and research programs include the [[ecological]] aspects of [[fisheries]] and [[coral reef]] sciences.&lt;ref name=Ecology&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/|title=CARMABI Research Institute|publisher=Research Station Carmabi Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Benson|Rehbock|2002|p=454}}{{Sfn|General Biological Supply House|1958|p=286}} 

==History==
In 1955, the head of Curaçao's petroleum industry proposed funding for a scientific institution at Piscadera Bay as it was noted to be a perfect location for research; subsequently, plans were drawn to establish the institution.{{Sfn|Caribbean Commission|1955|p=41}} Originally named the Caribbean Marine Biological Institute (CARMABI), the station was founded in 1955 at the bay's open end. Its work centered on research in the field of [[ecology]]—fisheries. As the bay front has extensive coral reefs, research in the field of coral reef science was initiated in 1969.  Consequent to increased participation in the activities of the institute, the CARMABI facility was enlarged, adding a new building with laboratory facilities on the shore line.  
Residential dormitories were also constructed to house 30 persons. By 1970, its facility contained wet and dry laboratories, an aquarium, as well as four work rooms.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences|National Research Council|1970|p=161}} 

In association with National Parks Foundation of the  Netherlands Antilles (STINPA), CARMABI has conducted terrestrial and marine projects, CARMABI being associated with research while STINPA is associated with management.{{Sfn|Benson|Rehbock|2002|p=454}} In 1999, CARMABI and STINAPA became a single entity, renamed as the Caribbean Research and Management of Biodiversity Foundation, although continuing to be referred to as CARMABI.&lt;ref name=researchstationcarmabi.orgHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/the-station/history|publisher=CARMABI|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARMABI, the [[SECORE]] (SExual COral REproduction) Foundation and the [[Seaquarium Beach|Curaçao Sea-Aquarium]] jointly carried out a study in Curaçao, which involved developing the techniques needed to regenerate [[Depauperate ecosystem|depauperate]] ''Acropora palmate'' in the entire area of  the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region10/pdf/diveteam/publications/2013_aaus_esdp_diving_for_science.pdf|title= Proceedings Joint International Scientific Diving Symposium American Academy Of Underwater Sciences And European Scientific Diving Panel|work= Restoration Of Critically Endangered Elkhorn Coral (''Acropora Palmata'') Using Sexually Produced Recruits |page=43|year=2013|publisher= American Academy of Underwater Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARMABI Foundation, also associated with the management of the Christoffel Park and the Shete Boka Park, is "the largest field station in the [[Southern Caribbean]]".&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; Jacques S.

In [[human geography]], a '''catchment area''' is the area from which a city, service or institution attracts a population that uses its services. For example, a school catchment area is the [[geographic]] area from which students are eligible to attend a local [[school]].

Governments and [[community service]] organizations often define catchment areas for planning purposes and [[public safety]] such as ensuring universal access to services like fire departments, police departments, ambulance bases and hospitals.

==Creation==
Catchment areas are generally established and modified by local governments. These boundaries can be modeled using [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLafferty |first1=Sara L. |title=GIS and Health Care |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=24 |issue= |pages=25–42 |year=2003 |pmid=12668754 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.24.012902.141012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be large variability in the services provided within different catchments in the same area depending upon how and when those catchments were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=C. |last2=Campbell |first2=J. |title=Catchment areas in general practice and their relation to size and quality of practice and deprivation: a descriptive study in one London borough |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7066 |pages=1189–92 |year=1996 |pmid=8916754 |pmc=2352502 |doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7066.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually contiguous but can overlap when they describe competing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuurman |first1=Nadine |last2=Fiedler |first2=Robert S |last3=Grzybowski |first3=Stefan CW |last4=Grund |first4=Darrin |title=Defining rational hospital catchments for non-urban areas based on travel-time |journal=International Journal of Health Geographics |volume=5 |issue= |pages=43 |year=2006 |pmid=17018146 |pmc=1617091 |doi=10.1186/1476-072X-5-43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining===
Catchments can be defined based upon a number of factors including distance to the facility, actual travel time to the facility, geographic boundaries or population within the catchment.  In a distance based catchment, the area serviced will often depend on the number of visits expected to that institution by each individual.  For example, it may be more acceptable to have a larger catchment for a hospital where any one individual will have few annual visits in comparison to a school where visits will be daily and hence desired distance would be closer.  
When a facility’s capacity can only service a certain volume, the catchment may be used to limit a population’s ability to access services outside that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Eddie |last2=Chalkley |first2=Brian |last3=Jones |first3=Allan |title=School Catchments and Pupil Movements: A case study in parental choice |journal=Educational Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=33–48 |doi=10.1080/03055690097727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, children may be unable to enroll in a school outside their catchment to prevent the school's services being exceeded.

==Examples==
*[[Airport]]s can be built and maintained in locations which minimize the driving distance for the surrounding population to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airports: Non-Financial Analysis |publisher=[[Transport Canada]] |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/airports/RSAS/nonfinanalysis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*A neighborhood or district of a city often has several small convenience shops, each with a catchment area of several streets.  Supermarkets, on the other hand, have a much lower density, with catchment areas of several neighborhoods (or several villages in rural areas).  This principle, similar to the [[central place theory]], makes catchment areas an important area of study for [[geographers]], [[economists]], and [[urban planners]].
*In Nigeria, most Federal Schools respect the fact that some states are educationally less developed than others. The country's higher education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Admission: University Admission |publisher=Students Nigeria |url=https://www.students.com.ng/category/admission }}&lt;/ref&gt; catchment areas have therefore been designed to ensure a good mixture of students from different backgrounds.

[[File:Catenaria in terra cruda a più corsi di conci.jpeg|400px|thumb|right|A [[mudbrick]] catenary arch]]
[[File:Hanging chain and arch.svg|400px|thumb|right|A [[catenary curve]] (left) and a catenary arch, also a catenary curve (right). One points up, and one points down, but the curves are the same.]]

A '''catenary arch''' is a type of [[architecture|architectural]] [[pointed arch]] that follows an inverted [[catenary curve]]. It is common in [[cathedral]]s and in [[Gothic arch]]es used in [[Gothic architecture]].&lt;ref name="American Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/the-perfect-dome|title=Letter to the Editors: The Perfect Dome|author=Handy, Richard L.|date=May 2011|work=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a [[parabolic arch]].

==In history==
[[File:17 Robert Hooke Engineer.JPG|thumb|250px|right|alt=Painting of Robert Hooke seated in a study, holding a small chain suspended between his hands by the ends|[[Robert Hooke]], holding a hanging [[chain]], which forms a catenary curve]]

The 17th-century scientist [[Robert Hooke]] wrote, "''Ut pendet continuum flexile, sic stabit contiguum rigidum inversum''", or, "As hangs a flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch." &lt;ref name="The enigma of Robert Hooke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantumfrontiers.com/2015/08/31/the-enigma-of-robert-hooke/|title=The enigma of Robert Hooke|author=|date=31 August 2015|work=Quantum Frontiers|publisher=Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, California Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A note written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1788 reads, "I have lately received from Italy a treatise on the equilibrium of arches, by the Abbé Mascheroni. It appears to be a very scientifical work. I have not yet had time to engage in it; but I find that the conclusions of his demonstrations are, that every part of the [[catenary]] is in perfect equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|title=Memoir, Correspondence, and Miscellanies, from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Volume 2|date=1830|publisher=Gray and Bowen|location=Boston|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjw-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural properties==
What makes the catenary arch important is its ability to withstand weight.&lt;ref name="St. Louis Gateway Arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/history/us/monuments/stlouisarch/|title=St. Louis Gateway Arch|author=|date=|work=enchantedlearning.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strath.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.strath.ac.uk/j.wood/Biomimetics/Engineering%20Areas/structures/PROP%201_files/PROP%201.htm|title=Building an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=strath.ac.uk|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an arch of uniform density and thickness, supporting only its own weight, the catenary is the ideal curve.&lt;ref name="The inverted catenary arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zonedome.com/?p=167|title=The inverted catenary arch|author=|date=|work=zonedome.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is done by a catenary curve: Catenary arches are strong, as they redirect the vertical force of gravity into compression forces pressing along the arch's curve. In a uniformly loaded catenary arch, the [[line of thrust]] runs through its center.&lt;ref name="Build an arch that can stand up by itself"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/files/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group1/catenary_arch/media/catenary_g.pdf|title=Build an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Getting the arch back into architecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/203465/203465.pdf|title=Getting the arch back into architecture|author=Karl Robin Nilsson|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nephology''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; from the Greek word ''nephos'' for 'cloud') is the study of [[cloud]]s and cloud formation. British meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] was a major researcher within this field, establishing a [[Cloud#Classification|cloud classification system]].

While this branch of [[meteorology]] still exists today, the term nephology, or nephologist is rarely used.  The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century, and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth.&lt;ref&gt;

Recently, interest in nephology (if not the name) has surged as many meteorologists have begun to focus on the relationship between clouds and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8f279aca-b0f6-11db-b901-0000779e2340.html Fluffy Thinking] ''Financial Times''.

* Since the late 1990s, some have suggested that when high solar activity lowers levels of [[cosmic ray]]s, that in turn reduces cloud cover and warms the planet. Others say that there is no statistical evidence for such an effect. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=cloud-formation-may-be-linked-to-cosmic-rays]

Some nephologists believe that an increase in global temperature could decrease the thickness and [[brightness]] (ability to reflect light energy), which would further increase global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/10/09/clouds.warming.enn/index.html Clouds' role in global warming studied] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225170154/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/10/09/clouds.warming.enn/index.html |date=25 December 2007 }} CNN website.

'''Common heritage of mankind''' (also termed the '''common heritage of humanity''', '''common heritage of humankind''' or '''common heritage principle''') is a principle of [[international law]] which holds that defined territorial areas and elements of humanity's common heritage (cultural and natural) should be held in trust for future generations and be protected from exploitation by individual [[nation states]] or [[corporations]].

==Origins==
In his essay ''Toward Perpetual Peace'', [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy-Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p 329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Common Heritage of Mankind'', however, was first mentioned in the preamble to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Hague 14 May 1954 http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html accessed 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of 'Mankind' is also mentioned in outer space treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389, 961 U.N.T.S. 187 (entered into force Sept. 1, 1972) and the 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695, 1023 U.N.T.S. 15 (entered into force Sept. 15, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Mankind' as a subject in international law also appears in the Preamble of the [[United Nations Charter]], the Preamble of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] (1949) and the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (1968).&lt;ref name=Gyula04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gyula Gál |title=Some Remarks to General Clauses of Treaty Space Law |journal=Miskolc Journal of International Law (Miskolci Nemzetközi Jogi Közlemények) |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law of the Sea Treaty ==
[[File:Oceans.png|150px|left|thumb|Map of the world's oceans]]
In 1970, [[United Nations General Assembly]] Resolution 2749, the ''Declaration of Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor'', was adopted by 108 nation states and stated that the deep seabed should be preserved for peaceful purposes and is the "Common Heritage of Mankind."&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Res. 2749 (XXV), ¶ 1, U.N. Doc. A/RES/25/2749 (Dec. 12, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Common Heritage of Mankind concept was stated to relate to "the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction" under Article 136 of the [[United Nations]] [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (UNCLOS).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 1, para. 1, Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.N.T.S. 397 [UNCLOS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Payoyo argues that the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in Part XI of the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] should favour developing states (who were the voice of [[conscience]] in establishing it), and not merely in some transient 'affirmative action' manner.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p 326.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims, however, that the 1994 ''Implementation Agreement'' facilitated control by industrialised countries of the [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA), allowing access by the private sector to the deep [[sea bed]] and inhibiting constructive dialogue on sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p458.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core conceptual components==
Maltese Ambassador [[Arvid Pardo]], one of the founders of the ''common heritage of humanity'' concept under international law, has claimed that it challenges the "structural relationship between rich and poor countries" and amounts to a "revolution not merely in the law of the sea, but also in international relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pardo A |title=Ocean, Space and Mankind |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=6 |pages=559–69 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/01436598408419785 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main architects of the principle under international space law has claimed that it is "the most important legal principle achieved by man throughout thousands of years during which law has existed as the regulating element of social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Cocca A. Introduction to the Study of the Legal Framework for Economic Activity in Space. Cordoba, 1982. p159 cited in {{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 250 fn11 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This praise relates to the fact that [[international law]] in the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle is seeking to protect, respect and fulfill the interests of human beings independently of any politically motivated [[sovereign state]]; the concept covering all humans wherever they are living, as well as future generations.&lt;ref name=Gyula04/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Common Heritage of Mankind: A Bibliography of Legal Writing|date=2013|publisher=Fondation de Malte|location=Malta|isbn=978-1-291-57725-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Common-Heritage-Mankind-Bibliography-Writing/dp/1291577254/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392109201&amp;sr=1-4|author2=Stroud, Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frakes has identified five core components of the Common Heritage of Humanity concept.&lt;ref name=Frakes03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frakes, Jennifer |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? |journal=Wisconsin International Law Journal |volume=21 |pages=409 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there can be no private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate shared management. Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of [[global public good]]. Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a "[[tragedy of the commons]]" scenario.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; Academic claims have been made that where the principle requires the establishment of an international resource management regime, prior to establishment of such a regime a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on resource exploitation should be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Narayana RK |title=Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=21 |pages=275 |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sehgal N |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=26 |issue= |pages=112 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a position does not appear to have been supported by most states during the respective drafting negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 259 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Destroyed Statue, July 17, 2005 at 15-53.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bamian Valley]] - UNESCO World Heritage listed site in [[Afghanistan]], showing destroyed [[Buddha]] statue.]]
A similar principle of international law holds that the world's [[cultural heritage|cultural]] and natural heritage (as nominated for listing by nation states) must be protected by states parties to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. World Heritage Convention. http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/ (accessed 27 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study in the use of these provisions was provided by the [[Franklin Dam]] [[non-violent protest]] campaign against the construction of a dam of [[Australia]]'s last wild river; they being held by the [[Australian High Court]] to provide a valid basis for legislation protecting the [[Franklin River]]. Justice Lionel Murphy wrote in that case (''[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]'') about the Common Heritage of Humanity principle: "The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war&amp;nbsp;... [t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]] (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential applications==

It was argued at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] and has been advocated by academics that global communication between individuals over the [[internet]] should be regarded as part of the Common Heritage of Mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henrik Spang-hanssen |title=Public International Computer Network Law Issues |publisher=Djoef Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=87-574-1486-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, it has been argued that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, [[laws]] and [[government]] [[policies]] should create the social preconditions whereby [[conscience]], properly understood, can be delinked from (often destructive) [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, and associated with a [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the Common Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffiths, Bede |title=A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith |publisher=Harpercollins/STL |year=1992 |page=276 |isbn=0-00-627636-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such thinking with associated implications about how a [[sustainable]] world in the future should be [[regulated]] is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson.

==Controversies about the principle==
[[File:NGC 6302 Hubble 2009.full.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[NGC 6302]] [[nebula]]. Militarization of [[Outer Space]] would be contrary to ''common heritage of humanity'' principles.]]Kemal Baslar has stated that the Common Heritage of Mankind principle "is a philosophical idea that questions the regimes of globally important resources regardless of their situation, and requires major changes in the world to apply its provisions. In other words, the application and enforcement of the common heritage of mankind require a critical reexamination of many well-established principles and doctrines of classical [[international law]], such as acquisition of territory, consent-based sources of international law, [[sovereignty]], [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[resource allocation]] and international personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kemal Baslar |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law |series=Developments in International Law |volume=30 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location=Dordrecht |year=1997 |isbn=90-411-0505-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to the [[tragedy of the commons]] dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248.

Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of [[conscience]] in achieving justice and equality in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Axelrod, Robert M. |title=The evolution of cooperation |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-02121-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting [[economic rationalism]] on such social and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G.

Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many that point out that as what we are seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on [[Malthusian]] ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment.

The extent to which the Common Heritage of Mankind principle does or should control the activities of private [[multinational corporations]] as well as [[nation states]], particularly with regard to [[mining]] activities, remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholson G |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind and Mining: An Analysis of the Law as to the High Seas, Outer Space, the Antarctic, and World Heritage |journal=New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law |volume=6 |pages=177 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underdeveloped nations]] often see the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyner CC |title=Legal Implications of the Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind |journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly |volume=35 |pages=190 |year=1986 |doi=10.1093/iclqaj/35.1.190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vereshchetin VS, Kamenetskaya EP |title=On the Way to a World Space Organization |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law  |volume=12 |pages=337 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

[[File:Statue of Liberty restoration project.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Statue of Liberty restoration project, 1984]]
A centennial '''conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty''' (''Liberty Enlightening the World'') occurred between 1984 and 1986. The [[Statue of Liberty]], by French sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], is a colossal artwork on [[Liberty Island]] in New York Harbor, and is a part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. Much of the restoration effort was based on unprecedented restorative methods, as metallurgical repair work on such a large scale had never been attempted. Many scientists, engineers, government organizations, and professional consultants evaluated and dealt with the various problems and tasks facing the restoration effort.

The restored statue was reopened during [[Liberty Weekend]], its 100-year anniversary celebration held July 3–6, 1986.

==Pre-restoration documentation efforts==
[[File:Statue of Liberty frontal 2.jpg|220px|right|thumb]]
The preparations for the centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty began in 1979. Formed by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), the custodians of the statue since 1933, to investigate possible development alternatives. A report titled "Analysis of Alternatives", published in December 1980, proposed measures to remedy the certain conditions confronting visitors to the Statue of Liberty, such as the long lines and waiting time to enter the crown of the statue. The proposed measures included the instatement of systems for numbered ticketing and early warnings that would allow visitors to estimate any possible waiting times and to be conveniently advised if and when to visit or enter the statue. The report also discussed ways to streamline ferry access both to and from Liberty Island and [[Ellis Island]]. The early report did not address the ever-deteriorating physical condition of the statue, which was already readily apparent.

The '''French American Committee for the Restoration of the Statue of Liberty''' was formed in May 1981.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;Blumberg, B., "Celebrating the Immigrant: An administrative History of the Statue of Liberty National Monument," p.139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of the Interior (of which the [[National Park Service]] is a bureau) later that month, on May 26, agreed to a working relationship with the Committee. In June 1981, the Committee was incorporated as a non-profit foundation licensed by the state of New York to raise funds for the restoration effort. The Committee hired four French consultants said to have considerable expertise in their respective fields: an architect-engineer, a [[Metallurgy|metals expert]], a structural engineer and a mechanical engineer who were asked to compose a technical report on the physical condition of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, R.S., and Despont, T., Restoring the Statue of Liberty: Sculpture, Structure, Symbol, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The French consultants visited Liberty Island in May, June, October and December 1981, before presenting a preliminary white paper to the National Park Service on the seventeenth of December in Washington D.C., titled "French Technical Report on Restoring the Statue of Liberty".&lt;ref name=blumberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Cliver, E.B. and Baboian, R., "Corrosion on the Statue of Liberty: an overview". In: The Statue of Liberty Restoration: Proceedings of the Statue of Liberty - Today for Tomorrow Conference, October 20–22, 1986, New York City, New York. [Ed. Baboian, R.; Bellante, E.L; Cliver, E.B.], Houston, Tex.: National Association of Corrosion Engineers, 1990, 149 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-877914-12-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report, written with the assistance of a regional historical architect from the NPS, was an attempt to identify and address the apparent problems associated with the statue. In the report, the consultants took note of what they saw to be the most serious problem affecting the statue: that two predominant sections, the torch-bearing arm and the rest platform at the head level, had corroded significantly. The report also alluded to the corroded girders toward the top of the pedestal and the bottom of the [[Pylon (architecture)|central pylon]]. The report also discussed the serious structural problems associated with the long-ago deteriorated insulating layer between the [[copper]] sheet of the statue and the iron bands of the [[Armature (sculpture)|structural armature]], as it had caused the iron bands to corrode. Alterations over the intervening years (1887–1916) to the torch had created such irreversible damage to the integral stability of that segment, that it was advised in the report that the torch be replaced. In order to more thoroughly assess possible damage that may be hidden beneath the layers of paint on the central pylon, the French consultants also suggested that the layers of paint covering it be removed. Two alternative proposals for modernizing the stairway within the statue were also proposed. From these preliminary observations, a number of preservation and replacement priorities were made. The white paper was further assessed and scrutinized by the NPS and other officials at the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in the nation's capital on March 5, 1982. The director of the NPS was impressed by the report, but also concerned about the future prospects of the Committee’s fund raising efforts.

Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced in May 1982 the creation of a 21-member '''Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission''' (better known as the '''Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation''') which would act as an "umbrella group" overseeing the French American Committee and the Ellis Island Restoration Commission. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation would try to privately raise funds for the restoration efforts. A report prepared by the NPS in September 1982, titled "General Management Plan", sought to discuss the fundraising aims and objectives of the newly created foundation, but reiterated most of the proposed measures (concerning the statue) of the earlier 1980 report "Analysis of Alternatives" (such as numbered ticketing systems, etc.).

Earlier in 1982, the French American Committee began looking for U.S. consultants to complement the technical work already begun by the four French consultants. They would need to prepare a detailed diagnostic report to investigate the conditions of the Statue in further detail, as many of the French consultants were unfamiliar with the construction procedures and standards, and the design and business practices employed in the United States. The inclusion of American participation was of obvious and pragmatic necessity to the restoration work that lay ahead. Several architects, structural engineers, and representatives from the NPS were brought aboard on the project. Construction work would be assigned to American contractors, and by July 1983, a joint diagnostic report was completed by the newly joint group of consultants and presented to NPS officials. By December 1983, the American group assumed many of the responsibilities concerning the design aspect of the project, and by August 1984, the American team terminated its contract with the French American Committee, owing to the Committee’s considerable fundraising problems and other related matters.

Just prior to the restoration efforts, there were an insufficient number of photographs documenting the initial reassembly of the statue (when it had been given), and too few photographs documenting the condition of the statue since its construction that were relevant to the maintenance of the statue. The NPS vowed to support the historical documentation effort, and a photographer was hired to photograph the entirety of the restoration—before, during, and after. Owing to this decision, an archive of two hundred large format photographs—both black and white, and multicolor—were developed for NPS and the [[Heritage Documentation Programs#Historic American Engineering Record (HAER)|Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER). According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) would also be donating a set of three-dimensional computer drawings of the statue, rendered in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) program.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" &gt;{{cite news |title=Engineers Fix Original Defects in the Statue |first=Calvin |last=Sims |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/17/science/engineers-fix-original-defects-in-the-statue.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 17, 1985 |page=C1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings were to aid in the future maintenance of the statue. These drawings were later given to the NPS, and were important in analyzing the wind bearing capacity of the structure within the statue.

==Implementation of diagnostic assessments==

===Early beginnings===

From November 7, 1982, public announcements were made by project officials that the [[Statue of Liberty]] would be completely closed to the public for as long as one year beginning in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Statue of Liberty Will Be Closed for Restoration in 1984 for As Long As a Year |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-will-be-closed-for-restoration-in-1984-for-as-long-as-a-year.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 7, 1982 |page=50 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue had been closed only once before for such an extended period of time, and that was at one point in the late 1930s. Later announcements stated that the erection of the [[scaffolding]] surrounding the outside of the statue would begin in the fall of 1983, and it was still believed in July 1983 that the restoration would begin sometime in the fall.&lt;ref name="nyt-1893-07-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Statue of Liberty to Be Repaired Starting in Fall |first=Philip |last=Shenon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-to-be-repaired-starting-in-fall.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 5, 1983 |page=B1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS representatives retracted and revised the earlier announcement concerning the closure of the Island to the public; Liberty Island would in fact remain open and closings would be intermittent and only for several days at a time at most.&lt;ref name="nyt-1893-07-05" /&gt; The restoration would not begin until January 23, 1984. An article from ''The [[New York Times]]'' published the day after, indicated that the 30-month project had officially begun the day before, and that visitors would have approximately two weeks remaining before the statue would be completely enshrouded by the tons of extruded aluminum scaffolding that had just been deposited on Liberty Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Renovation Begins on Miss Liberty |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1984 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scaffolding contract was awarded to a company called Universal Builders Supply (UBS) Inc. on December 14, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UBS Company History | publisher=UBS | url=http://www.ubs1.com/new-site/gallery2/gallery2embedded.php?g2_itemId=47 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205155353/http://www.ubs1.com/new-site/gallery2/gallery2embedded.php?g2_itemId=47 | archivedate=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract stipulated that the freestanding exterior scaffold was to be completely assembled by April 27, 1984. The {{convert|240|ft|m}} high scaffolding was designed specifically for the statue, and required ingenuity from its designers, as it could only be attached to the granite pedestal and not the statue and had to accommodate the intricate contours of the statue as well. Furthermore, the exterior scaffolding had to maintain a distance of at least 18&amp;nbsp;inches from any exposed section of the [[copper sheathing]]. The 6,000 or so separate components of the scaffold, made of a high load capacity aluminum (alloy 6061 T6), were unloaded onto Liberty Island on January 23, 1984. To prevent possible rust stains from affecting the exterior [[patina]] of the statue, the pretext was adopted of using aluminum. Screw jacks were used to brace the aluminum against the granite pedestal of the statue. More easily an interior scaffolding was developed made of interlocking pipes held together with friction clamps and anchored to the central pylon of the statue for structural support. The twenty UBS workers often resorted to assembling the interior scaffolding when the severe winds and dreadful winter weather conditions prevented them from continuing their work outside.

===Interior coating removal===

Once the interior scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of the interior coatings was executed.&lt;ref name="Gale, F. 1984, p. 63-5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gale |first1=F. |last2=Robbins |first2=J. C. |title=Removal of Interior Coatings at the Statue of Liberty |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=16 |issue=3-4 |pages=63-5 |doi=10.2307/1494040 |jstor=1494040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would be removed from the interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A ''New York Times'' article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted "government green" would be cleaned to resemble the [[Salmon (color)|salmon]] color of a new [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]]. That outermost "government green" layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975.
 
Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|red lead primer]] plus six additional coats) and the two layers of [[Asphalt|bituminous paint]] (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.

Several coating removal methods for the interior copper were ruled out. According to the evaluative research completed, the abrasive removal method (involving aluminum oxide) could damage the underlying layer of the copper substrate. Highly flammable and toxic chemical removal methods were ruled out, as they would have been far too time consuming and could have negatively affected the delicate patina of the exterior (if seepage of the chemicals were to have occurred).

===Alternative removal method adopted===
















Two researchers, an architectural conservator from [[Columbia University]] and a historical architect working for the (North Atlantic Historic Preservation Center) NAHPC sought to address the attendant difficulties of removing the different layers of paint without further damaging the statue. The researchers finally decided upon an innovative cryogenic removal method, in which liquid nitrogen was sprayed on the paint-covered surface. The liquid nitrogen would em-brittle the layers of the paint at {{convert|-320|F|C}}, causing the cracking paint to lose the adherent properties it once possessed. It was estimated that approximately {{convert|3500|USgal|l}} of liquid nitrogen would be needed for the interior coating removal. According to the researchers, "the use of liquid nitrogen in large scale coating removal was somewhat innovative."&lt;ref name="Gale, F. 1984, p. 63-5"/&gt; The moist squirt gun division of the [[Union Carbide]] Corporation of Danbury, Connecticut, which at the time was "the largest producer of liquid atmospheric gases in the United States", donated the liquid nitrogen for the restoration efforts. The company’s researchers also worked with the NPS in fabricating special tools for controlling the application of the liquid nitrogen.

The [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] method was inadequate for the removal of the two final layers of bituminous coating that were below the surface of the seven layers of lead and vinyl based paints. A small yet powerful sandblasting tool that would sandblast and vacuum simultaneously was developed specifically for the removal of the stubborn coating. The tool devised by the Blast and Vac company of [[Bolivar, Ohio]], was "a standard blasting nozzle inside a vacuum cleaner head". A commercial grade bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), manufactured by [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] was donated and applied as the cleaning agent that would be abrasive yet gentle on the copper sheathing. The baking soda leaked through the holes and crevices in the sheathing, and was affecting the coloration of the patina on the external side of the statue so the workers would rinse the outer surface of the statue, to prevent the baking soda from turning the green patina of the statue blue.

===Coating and sealant application===

Once the layers of paint had been removed from the interior of the statue, the architects and engineers knew that a coating system far more suitable than any of the preexisting applications that had been used, would need to be implemented to protect the iron of the statue’s interior. The coating would have to be able to provide protection against corrosion in a marine environment and have to have a zero level VOC (volatile organic compound) emission rating. A coating was sought for the sandblasted central pylon and the secondary framework, and found.

In 1970, a patent was awarded to [[NASA]] for a [[Hemimorphite|zinc silicate]] primer coating called K-Zinc 531, the name owing to the ratio of silicon/potassium to water being 5:3:1.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, V., “Coating removal from the statue’s Interior” in The Statue of Liberty restoration: Proceedings of the today for tomorrow conference ed. Baboian, R., Bellante, E.L, and Cliver, E.B., p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; The coating had the following characteristics: it was non-toxic, non-flammable, and would dry smoothly on metals within half an hour of surface application. In 1981, NASA granted the license for the coating to Shane Associates of [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]]. In 1982 a company called Inorganic Coatings (IC) based in Malvern, a borough in Chester county Pennsylvania, signed an agreement with the former company to become the sole manufacturer and sales agent of the zinc silicate variant. The protective coating was renamed IC 531, but much like the original coating developed by NASA was a high-ratio waterborne zinc silicate. The IC 531 was used in the restoration efforts to provide a number of the structural elements of the statue with superior corrosion resistance.

==Iron armature system==

===Condition of the iron grid system prior to restoration===

Although many of the [[Armature (sculpture)|armature bars]] were replaced in 1937-38, the restoration effort involved the successful attempt to replace nearly every {{convert|2|by|5/8|in|0}} ribbon like armature bar that made up the unique internal structure of the statue (as the bars are not connected to the copper skin, but are held in place by the copper saddles that are riveted into the copper skin). A ''New York Times'' article from December 17, 1985 indicated that the most serious internal problem with the statue was the corrosion that had taken place in the iron armatures which provide the support to the copper sheathing.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Eiffel knew that galvanic reaction would immediately pose a problem, owing to the dissimilarity of the metals used in the statue (copper and iron), which unless insulated would corrode rapidly. However, the method used to try and prevent galvanic corrosion of the armature system had proven to be ineffective. 

The original insulating layer implemented between the copper sheathing and the iron bars was an asbestos cloth soaked in shellac. This insulating and isolating system had separated the two metals when it was constructed, but the ingeniously devised system had broken down over time and was compromising the structural stability of many different components. The insulating layer had lost much of its functional isolating capacity due to exposure to interior condensation, leakage and possibly from other variable atmospheric effects of the marine environment. It had deteriorated into a sponge-like material which merely retained the saltwater as a conductive electrolyte. Hastening the decline of the corroded iron, the buildup of corrosive discharge exerted pressure on the riveted copper saddles that had held the iron bars in place. This created buckling and warping, and further caused the rivets to become disjointed. Rainwater would seep into the holes in the copper sheathing which once held the disjointed rivets. Some of the seams and holes were still sealed and coated with a coal tar paint applied in 1911. The streaks of coal tar paint from when it had been applied 74 years earlier were still visible during the restoration efforts. Black tar streaks from these so-called "weep holes" were running down the exterior of the statue and had altered the patina of the external copper sheathing.

An atmospheric research scientist and a technical assistant from [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]], developed a greenish liquid composed of corroded copper particles roughly matching the statue's exterior in chemical composition, which was then sprayed over the tar streaked exterior. The sprayed on particles were then left to develop and spread over the streaks and stains. Both researchers, specializing in the study of the corrosion on copper and copper alloys became interested in the restoration efforts and proposed to donate their expertise to the restoration effort as it would afford them with an opportunity to study the effects of the atmosphere on the hundred year old copper structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bell Lab Scientists Working as Liberty's 'Dermatologists' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 1986 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement of the iron grid system===

[[Copper]] was considered as a possible alternative metal for the replication of the "puddled" iron armatures, but was ruled out. The NPS performed tests to assess the suitability of possible replacement materials for the iron bars. 316L stainless steel was selected to replace the approximately 1800 iron armature bars, and [[Ferralium]], a [[steel]]-[[aluminum]] [[alloy]], was chosen to replace the flat bars that connect the secondary framework to the armature. As the armatures provide the structural support for the copper skin, it was determined that no more than four bars from each of four different sections of the statue (for a total of sixteen bars) be removed at any given time. These were then replicated mostly by eye, and the replacements installed within 36 hours of the removal of the original. An [[art restoration]] company working along with a steel contractor undertook the difficult task.

Replacement bars were annealed and sandblasted to remove iron filings and other contaminants that would or could eventually cause the stainless steel to rust, and then dipped in nitric acid for protection. The "long term service behavior" of 316L [[stainless steel]], according to a professor of metallurgy at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who had some involvement in the early stages of the restoration effort, was not known.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., 2004, "The Case of the Lamed Lady Liberty" Design News, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement bars of the iron grid system were insulated from the copper with a [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] (Teflon) polymer resin tape produced by the [[DuPont]] company.

A ''New York Times'' article from May 31, 1986 reported that inspection crews overseeing the restoration efforts had noticed several months earlier that a five foot long armature bar near one of the arms had been stamped with the forty names of the forty iron workers who had installed the armatures. The bar, which had to be replaced, was paid for by the contractors. Before being replaced, the bar was photographed; the image is in the June 1986 issue of [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine.

===Torch===

The torch was removed from the statue on July 4, 1984. An article in ''The New York Times'' from October 8, 1984, stated that the new torch is to be completed in the same manner that the old torch was made in 14 months by ten craftsmen from Les metalliers Champenois based in Reims, and that a workshop at the statue's base on Liberty Island had been made accessible to the public that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Torch of Liberty to Be Built by French |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/08/nyregion/new-torch-of-liberty-to-be-built-by-french.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=United Press International |date=October 8, 1984 |page=B2 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural misalignment issues==

===Initial assessments===

Within the copper body of the statue is the structural support system consisting of a 97-foot (30 m) central pylon, which is the backbone of the statue. The pylon consists of four girders with horizontal and diagonal cross bracing systems, which provide support to the secondary framework and to the armature, and a 40-foot (12 m) long extension that supports the raised arm and torch. It had been a well-documented fact at least since 1932 (when the War Department reinforced the arm-shoulder structure), that the support for the shoulder of the upheld arm had been misaligned. Then, it was discovered that the arch that supports the head of the statue had also been misaligned. The cause(s) of the misalignments are undetermined, but a few hypotheses have been suggested. The first hypothesis proposed was that Viollet le Duc—the engineer who initially worked on the project with Bartholdi and who designed the structural reinforcement of the arm and the head (displayed in 1876 at the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia)&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J., 2002, "A 'Monster Edifice': Ambivalence, Appropriation, and the Forging of Cultural Identity at the Centennial Exhibition", The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, 126:4 p.648.&lt;/ref&gt; had died after having completed those two sections—and had employed engineering methods that differed significantly from those of the better-known bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel, who had finished the remainder of the work on the statue, and who is generally credited for the statue's remarkable structure. The second hypothesis was that the Americans, after having uncrated the different sections of the statue in 1886, incorrectly reassembled the structural framework. The third hypothesis is that the statue’s creator, Bartholdi, was aesthetically dissatisfied when the statue was fully assembled and displayed in Paris on or just prior to July 4, 1884, and that he must have willingly sacrificed the structural integrity for his aesthetic vision.

One of the main architects of the restoration project was initially convinced that the second hypothesis was correct, but according to a quoted and published statement, recent research had convinced him of the veracity of the third hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, E.V., 1986, "Engineering Miss Liberty's Rescue" Popular Science, 228:6, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant problems were consequences of poor design and construction choices implemented initially, but Eiffel could not have directly been responsible for such glaring mistakes according to the (same) architect.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Computer aided design drawings were used to illustrate how the head and the hand wielding the torch had been misaligned, and how the misalignment had caused the spikes of the crown to damage a section of the torch-bearing arm. The "13 trouble spots of the statue" were visually emphasized in a front page ''New York Times'' article from July 20, 1983. The head was {{convert|2|ft|cm}} off center and the upheld arm was {{convert|18|in|cm}}away from where it was designed to be.

With the computer simulations of the CAD program, the architects were able to assess the likelihood of implementing either of the following options to address the misalignment issue: the option of rebuilding the arm-shoulder connection as Eiffel had envisioned it, or they could strengthen the preexisting misalignment by adding new diagonal bracing and steel plates. The latter option would have the intended effect of further reinforcing the repairs that had been made when the problem was initially noticed in 1932 by the War department when it had jurisdiction over the statue. Regardless, the "finite element analysis" of the computer simulation showed that both solutions would work. Additional supports were also added inside the head to improve overall stability. Hence, the positions of the arm and the head would remain as they had been since they were reassembled on [[Bedloe's Island]] in 1886.

===Preservation objectives===

According to the ''New York Times'', the architects on the project assured the reporter that despite the misalignment, "cosmetic changes" to the statue would not take place.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Several commentators on the historic restoration project seemed to have reiterated a similar guiding sentiment: that preservation rather than unnecessary replacement would be the objective of the current restoration effort. This was quite reassuring, in the light of proposals put forward early on during the restoration efforts such as the following: "cleaning and polishing of the statue’s exterior; demolition of the statue, selling of the copper and the use of the funds raised to build an exact duplicate in fiberglass; the application of an epoxy coating to the exterior and the construction of a competing monument..."&lt;ref&gt;Bellante, E.l., and Cliver, E.B, 1987 "Restoring the Statue of Liberty: Construction or Conservation?" In: Old cultures in New Worlds 8th ICOMOS General Assembly and International Symposium. Programme report - Compte rendu. US/ICOMOS, Washington, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article from February 8, 1984 mentioned that the idea to have an elevator that would reach to the crown of the statue had been recently abandoned. A double level hydraulic glass elevator would be installed inside the base of the statue from which visitors would be able to access the crown by ascending a few steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interior Restoration Set at the Statue of Liberty |first=Jane |last=Perlez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/08/nyregion/interior-restoration-set-at-the-statue-of-liberty.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 8, 1984 |page=B3 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the interior had been reconstructed, with a great deal of emphasis placed on enhancing the visitors experience, as the original structure was not devised with the visitor in mind, poor lighting conditions, no ventilation and a very inadequate and basic heating system were to be changed.

Prior to the restoration, much of the internal structure of the statue was out of sight behind the mesh wire walls of the original helical stairs. It should be noted that the stairs were originally intended for workmen. Neither the architect nor the artist had envisioned that the lady would welcome visitors internally. Elevators were first installed in 1908–9. A ''New York Times'' article published less than a month and a half from the centennial celebration, discussed the changes within the statue as being the most spectacular. The journalist added: that "now that the walls have been removed, what is revealed is an interior that seems to combine the toughness of 19th century industrial construction and the grace of a cathedral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Triumph of Restoration Enters Its Final, Fenzied Weeks - For Miss Liberty, A New Grandeur |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |authorlink=Paul Goldberger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/27/nyregion/triumph-restoration-enters-its-final-frenzied-weeks-for-miss-liberty-new.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 27, 1986 |page=B1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drei Frauen am Pranger, China, Anonym, um 1875.jpg|thumb|right|Three women in the [[pillory]], [[Ching China|China]], 1875]]
'''Criminology''' (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|crīmen}}, "accusation" originally derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] verb "krino" "κρίνω", and Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logy|-logia'', from "logos" meaning: “word,” “reason,” or “plan”) is the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of the nature, extent, management, causes, control, consequences, and prevention of [[criminal behavior]], both on individual and social levels. Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[social science]]s, drawing especially upon the research of [[sociology|sociologists]], [[psychology|psychologists]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[social anthropology|social anthropologists]], as well as scholars of law.

The term ''criminology'' was coined in 1885 by Italian law professor [[Raffaele Garofalo]] as ''[[:it:Criminologia|criminologia]].'' Later, French anthropologist [[Paul Topinard]] used the analogous French term ''[[:fr:Criminologie|criminologie]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociological Theory and Criminological Research: Views from Europe and the United States |page=279 |editor=Deflem, Mathieu |isbn=978-0-7623-1322-8 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States for the past 100 years, criminology has experienced three life course phases : (1) Golden Age of Research (1900-1930) which has been described as multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930-1960) which shows that they were no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory, and 1960-2000 period as seen as a significant turning point for criminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=J.|date=2000-03-01|title=The New Regulatory State and the Transformation of Criminology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/40/2/222/611103?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=222–238|doi=10.1093/bjc/40.2.222|issn=0007-0955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminological Schools of thought==
In the mid-18th century, criminology arose as [[social philosophy|social philosophers]] gave thought to crime and concepts of law. Over time, several schools of thought have developed. There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical]], [[Positivist school (criminology)|Positivist]], and [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago]]. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, labeling, [[critical criminology]], [[cultural criminology]], [[Postmodernist school (criminology)|postmodern criminology]], [[Feminist school of criminology|feminist criminology]] and others discussed below.

===Classical school===
{{POV|date=January 2013}}
The [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical school]] arose in the mid-18th century and has its basis in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosophy. [[Cesare Beccaria]],&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Beccaria, Cesare |title=On Crimes and Punishments, and Other Writings |year=1764 |page=64 |translator=Richard Davies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1763–64), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (inventor of the ''[[panopticon]]''), and other philosophers in this school argued:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# People have [[free will]] to choose how to act.
# The basis for deterrence is the idea humans are '[[Hedonism|hedonists]]' who seek pleasure and avoid pain, and 'rational calculators' who weigh the costs and benefits of every action. It ignores the possibility of [[irrationality]] and unconscious drives as motivators.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
# [[Punishment]] (of sufficient severity) can deter people from crime, as the costs (penalties) outweigh benefits, and severity of punishment should be proportionate to the crime.&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"/&gt;
# The more swift and certain the punishment, the more effective as a deterrent to criminal behavior.
This school developed during a major reform in [[penology]], when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms, the [[French Revolution]], and the development of the [[Law of the United States|legal system in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Positivist school===
The [[Positivist school]] argues criminal behavior comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: [[Positivist school (criminology)#Biological positivism|biological]], [[Positivist school (criminology)#Psychological postivism|psychological]] and [[social positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;David, Christian Carsten.

====Italian school====
[[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called "the father of [[criminal anthropology|criminology]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227053359/http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |archivedate=27 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the [[Italian school of criminology]].&lt;ref name="siegel-p7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Siegel, Larry J. |title=Criminology, 8th edition |year=2003 |publisher= Thomson-Wadsworth |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crime and Society: Readings in History and Theory |isbn=978-0-415-02755-7 |author1=McLennan, Gregor |author2=Jennie Pawson |author3=Mike Fitzgerald |publisher= Routledge |page=311 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheek bones or hairline, or a cleft palate could indicate "[[atavism|atavistic]]" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of [[phrenology]] and by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], has been superseded. [[Enrico Ferri]], a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories, since [[control group]]s were not used in his studies.&lt;ref name="siegel-p139"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociological positivism====
[[Sociological positivism]] suggests societal factors such as [[poverty]], membership of subcultures, or low levels of education predispose people to crime. [[Adolphe Quetelet]] used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors. He found age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/228630 |title=Adolphe Quetelet and the Origins of Positivist Criminology |author=Beirne, Piers |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=92 |date=March 1987 |pages=1140–1169 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments, each one proving education reduces crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lochner|first=Lance|title=The American Economic Review|journal=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|volume=94|pages=155–189|doi=10.1257/000282804322970751|year=2004|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4mf8k11n|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rawson W. Rawson]] used [[crime statistics]] to suggest a link between [[population density]] and [[crime rate]]s, with crowded cities producing more crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hayward, Keith J. |title=City Limits: Crime, Consumerism and the Urban Experience |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-904385-03-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Fletcher (statistician)|Joseph Fletcher]] and John Glyde read papers to the [[Statistical Society of London]] on their studies of crime and its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Garland, David |chapter=Of Crimes and Criminals |page=21 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Criminology, 3rd edition |editor=Maguire, Mike |editor2=Rod Morgan |editor3=Robert Reiner |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Mayhew]] used [[empirical]] methods and an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] approach to address social questions and poverty, and gave his studies in ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25 |title=Henry Mayhew: London Labour and the London Poor |publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160854/http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25/ |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people.

====Differential association (subcultural)====
People learn crime through [[Differential association|association]]. This theory was advocated by [[Edwin Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deviance: A Symbolic Interactionist Approach|last=Herman|first=Nancy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1995|isbn=978-1882289387|location=Michigan|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances. Interacting with [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] peers is a major cause. Reinforcing criminal behavior makes it chronic. Where there are criminal [[subcultures]], many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ferracuti|title=Criminological Theory Summaries|url=http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|publisher=Cullen &amp; Agnew|accessdate=3 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131020192418/http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago school===
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess]], and other [[urban sociology|urban sociologists]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  In the 1920s, Park and Burgess identified five [[Concentric ring model|concentric zones]] that often exist as cities grow, including the "[[zone of transition]]", which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder.  In the 1940s, [[Harry McKay|Henry McKay]] and Clifford R. Shaw focused on [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]], finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition.

Chicago school sociologists adopted a [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience breakdown in the [[social structure]] and [[institution]]s such as family and schools.  This results in [[social disorganization]], which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]].

Other researchers suggested an added social-psychological link.  [[Edwin Sutherland]] suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals with whom they may associate.

Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include [[psychoanalysis]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[interactionism]], [[Marxism]], [[econometrics]], [[systems theory]], [[postmodernism]], [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], etc.

===Social structure theories===
This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a [[conflict theory]] or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime. As this perspective is itself broad enough, embracing as it does a diversity of positions.&lt;ref&gt;Hester, S., Eglin, P. 1992, ''A Sociology of Crime'', London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social disorganization (neighborhoods)====
[[Social disorganization theory]] is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shaw, Clifford R.  |author2=McKay, Henry D. |title=Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1942 |isbn=978-0-226-75125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of [[population turnover]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Disorganization and Theories of Crime and Delinquency: Problems and Prospects |author1=Bursik Jr. |author2=Robert J. |journal=Criminology |year=1988 |volume=26 |pages=519–539 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1988.tb00854.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, ‘subcultures’ or ‘gangs’. These groups have different values to the [[social norm]]. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population [[Heterogeneous|heterogeneity]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt; With high turnover, informal [[social structure]] often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain [[social order]] in a community.

====Social ecology====
Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.  Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morenoff, Jeffrey |author2=Robert Sampson |author3=Stephen Raudenbush |title=Neighborhood Inequality, Collective Efficacy and the Spatial Dynamics of Urban Violence |journal=Criminology |volume=39 |year=2001 |pages=517–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2001.tb00932.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[working class|working]] and [[Middle class|middle-class]] people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. [[William Julius Wilson]] suggested a poverty "concentration effect", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Larry|title=Criminology: Theories, Patterns, and Typologies|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1305446090|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strain theory (social strain theory)====
{{Main|Strain theory (sociology)}}
Strain theory, also known as Mertonian Anomie, advanced by American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the ''[[American Dream]]''. Most people buy into this dream, and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivator. Merton also used the term ''[[anomie]]'', but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]].  Merton saw the term as meaning a [[dichotomy]] between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve.  Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] subcultures (such as [[Gang|gang members]], or what he calls "[[hobo]]s"). [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]] developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as [[general strain theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merton, Robert |year=1957 |title=Social Theory and Social Structure |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-02-921130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory'''

''Main article: Messner and Institutional Anomie Theory''

The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory stems from a pre-existing theory, discovered by Merton named Strain theory. Rosenberger took his findings and offered a different approach to definition and based it on the assumption that everybody should already have "the assumption that the “American Dream” produces a society that is dominated by the economy and obsessed with the pursuit of success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberger|first=Jared|date=October 2016|title=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=a46dc574-3755-410e-8199-998554e3b4a9%40sdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116344296&amp;db=sih|journal=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|volume= 49|pages=305–325. 21p|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory has many different views and definitions by many people therefore this becomes a very flexible theory.

Larine Hughes found a correlation between economic pressure and how it combines the "American Dream" and "Individualism" to a high crime. Hughes came to  final decision that "Therefore, individuals that do not have the drive to succeed and achieve this “goal”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Lorine|date=2015|title=Economic Dominance, the "American Dream," and Homicide:|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f60096cd-f6eb-4b62-b63c-18b30345ebe9%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100487344&amp;db=sih|journal=A Cross-National Test of Institutional Anomie Theory|volume= 85|pages=p. 100–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will fail, despite social and cultural pressures.

Samantha Applin, then took an approached relating genders and The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory. Stated in an article by S. Applin, "males make up what is considered “normal subjects”, and due to this, force woman to lie on a boundary that expectation is outside the dominant cultural frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samantha|first=Applin|date=April 2014|title=Her American Dream|url=https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1557085114525654|journal=Bringing Gender Into Institutional-Anomie Theory|volume= 10|pages= 36–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, setting women back in the beginning stages of Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory.

Brian Stults began to research studies on the violence between youth and the correlation that it  has on Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory. Stults found sated " As well as the results showed graduating high school represents an important developmental stage in American society, as it ends the compulsory education, and is often followed by a significant decline in daily need and extra resources from your parents."

====Subcultural theory====
{{Main|Subcultural theory}}
Following the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and strain theory, and also drawing on [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s idea of [[differential association]], subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups [[Fragmentation (sociology)|fragmenting]] away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life.

[[Albert K. Cohen]] tied anomie theory with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[reaction formation]] idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cohen, Albert |title=Delinquent Boys |publisher=Free Press |year=1955 |isbn=978-0-02-905770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include "toughness" and disrespect for authority.  Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kornhauser, R. |year=1978 |title=Social Sources of Delinquency |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-45113-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]] suggested that delinquency can result from a differential opportunity for lower class youth.&lt;ref name="cloward"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cloward, Richard, Lloyd Ohlin |title=Delinquency and Opportunity |publisher=Free Press |year=1960 |isbn=978-0-02-905590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as [[minimum wage]]-paying jobs available to them.&lt;ref name="cloward"/&gt;

Delinquency tends to occur among the lower working-class males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas, as mentioned extensively by Albert Cohen (Cohen, 1965). Bias has been known to occur among law enforcement agencies, where officers tend to place bias on minority groups, without knowing for sure if they had committed a crime or not. Delinquents may also commit crimes in order to secure funds for themselves or their loved ones, such as committing an armed robbery, as studied by many scholars (Briar &amp; Piliavin).

British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of [[Social class|class]], where some criminal activities were seen as "imaginary solutions" to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults.

Sociologists such as [[Raymond Gastil|Raymond D. Gastil]] have explored the impact of a [[Southern culture of honor]] on violent crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond D. Gastil, "Homicide and a Regional Culture of Violence," American Sociological Review 36 (1971): 412-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control theories====
Another approach is made by the social bond or [[social control theory]]. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do ''not'' become criminal. [[Travis Hirschi]] identified four main characteristics: "attachment to others", "belief in moral validity of rules", "commitment to achievement", and "involvement in conventional activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirschi, Travis |title=Causes of Delinquency |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-7658-0900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal).  On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low [[self control]] is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A General Theory of Crime |author=[[Michael R. Gottfredson|Gottfredson, Michael R.]], [[Travis Hirschi|Hirschi, Travis]] |year=1990 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one.  If the person cannot exert self-control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms.

Social bonds, through [[Peer group|peers]], parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control.  For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children, from those who are not delinquent, is the control exerted by parents or [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson, Harriet |title=Parental Supervision: A Neglected Aspect of Delinquency |year=1980 |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, theorists such as [[David Matza]] and [[Gresham Sykes]] argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social behavioral constraints through [[techniques of neutralization]].

====Psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for punishment====
Psychoanalysis is the system of psychological theory and therapy looking towards the investigation of the conscious and unconscious mind elements, along with repressed memories that can be taken back into consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Broadview Editions|year=2011|isbn=|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his novel, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' which was interpreted by Hubback.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freud looks into research indicating a ‘repetition compulsion’ and a ‘death drive’ which is the unconscious impulse that one may get to become self-destructive and actually have the ability to take over the creativity drive within someone. Phillida Rosnick, author of the article ''Mental Pain and Social Trauma,'' looks into the mental state of someone who has experienced extreme trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosnick|first=Phillida|date=2017|title=Mental Pain and Social Trauma|url=|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=94(6)|pages=1200–1202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They discovered there is a difference in the actions and thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain and this corresponds to them having thoughts and feelings that are unlike their normal selves. By looking at the unconscious within a paranoid state of mind from trauma, there is a direct correlation to how this behavior can cause criminals to act in deviant ways based on their brain structure and how their unconscious is taking information. Sander Gilman, the author of the article ''Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis'', actually looks into the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system relating to the impulses that someone might feel and the impulses that might cause someone to unconsciously desire pain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilman|first=Sander|date=2008|title=Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/docview/199033499?accountid=28917|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|pages=1799–1800|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman speaks to Freud’s position on the various issues of the mind and the potential discovery from looking at the brain and interpreting data about the unconscious mind and the Eros within the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By looking at how psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for pain relate to each other, there is more evidence as to how it can occur within criminals and how these impulses or the innate desires within an individual can ultimately be the cause of deviant acts.

==Social network analysis==
{{main|Social network analysis (criminology)}}

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism draws on the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], as well as [[subcultural theory]] and [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mead, George Herbert |title=Mind Self and Society |year=1934 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought focused on the relationship between state, media, and conservative-ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the "significant other" in the less powerful groups' processes of generating [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to "label" minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take the label on board, indulge in crime more readily, and become [[Free will|actors]] in the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] and [[Edwin Lemert]], in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Becker, Howard |title=Outsiders |publisher=Free Press |year=1963 |isbn=978-0-684-83635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] developed the concept of "[[moral panic]]" describing societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena (e.g. post-World War 2 youth cultures like the [[Mods and Rockers]] in the UK in 1964, [[AIDS epidemic]] and [[football hooliganism]]).

==== Labeling theory ====
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
Labelling theory refers to an individual who is labelled in a particular way and was studied in great detail by Becker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slattery|first=Martin|title=Key Ideas In Sociology|year=2003|publisher=Nelson Thornes|pages=154+}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arrives originally from sociology but is regularly used in criminological studies. It is said that when someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime. Even those who initially reject the label can eventually accept it as the label becomes more well known, particularly among their peers. This stigma can become even more profound when the labels are about deviancy, and it is thought that this stigmatization can lead to [[Deviancy amplification spiral|deviancy amplification]]. [[Malcolm W. Klein|Malcolm Klein]] conducted a test which showed that labelling theory affected some youth offenders but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelin|first=Malcolm|journal=Criminal Justice &amp; Behaviour|date=March 1986|volume=13|pages=47–79|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0093854886013001004|title=Labeling Theory and Delinquency Policy: An Experimental Test|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061209/http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|archivedate=14 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual theories===
[[File:Keyhoe sign.jpg|thumb|right|The self-assessment of the perpetrator of the [[Bath School disaster]] ]]

====Traitor theories====
At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist [[Lonnie Athens]] developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. [[Richard Rhodes]]' ''Why They Kill'' describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  Rhodes| first =  Richard| title = Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist| publisher = Vintage| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-375-40249-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rational choice theory====
{{Main|Rational choice theory (criminology)}}
[[File:Cesare Beccaria 1738-1794.jpg|thumb|180px|Cesare Beccaria]]
Rational choice theory is based on the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], classical school philosophies of [[Cesare Beccaria]], which were popularized by [[Jeremy Bentham]].  They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender. In ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'' (On Crimes and Punishments, 1763–1764), Beccaria advocated a rational [[penology]]. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime; thus, the judge was simply to conform his or her sentence to the law. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and [[sin]], and advocated against the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], as well as [[torture]] and inhumane treatments, as he did not consider them as rational deterrents.

This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s with the writings of [[James Q. Wilson]], [[Gary Becker]]'s 1965 article ''Crime and Punishment''&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker]], "Crime and Punishment", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol. 76 (2), March–April 1968, p.196-217&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Stigler]]'s 1970 article ''The Optimum Enforcement of Laws''.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler]], "The Optimum Enforcement of Laws", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol.78 (3), May–June 1970, p. 526–536&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theory argues that criminals, like other people, weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms.&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cornish, Derek |author2=Ronald V. Clarke |year=1986 |title=The Reasoning Criminal |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-96272-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors.&lt;ref name="cornish"/&gt;

Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing [[surveillance]], one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.

With this perspective, [[crime prevention]] or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as [[target hardening]].&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clarke, Ronald V. |year=1992 |title=Situational Crime Prevention |publisher=Harrow and Heston |isbn=978-1-881798-68-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, law enforcement presence, added street lighting, and other measures, are effective in reducing crime.&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"/&gt;

One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the [[panopticon]]), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which the measures required would cost the supermarket so much that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and [[classical liberalism]] have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable.

Such rational choice theories, linked to [[neoliberalism]], have been at the basics of [[crime prevention through environmental design]] and underpin the [[Market Reduction Approach]] to theft &lt;ref&gt;Sutton, M.

====Routine activity theory====
{{Main|Routine activity theory}}
Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Felson, Marcus |title=Crime and Everyday Life |year=1994 |publisher=Pine Forge |isbn=978-0-8039-9029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohen, Lawrence |author2=Marcus Felson |title=Social Change and Crime Rate Trends |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=44 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2094589 |pages=588–608 |issue=4 |jstor=2094589|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.3696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of "place manager" such as rental property managers who can take [[nuisance]] abatement measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reducing Crime and Drug Dealing by Improving Place Management: A Randomized Experiment |author1=Eck, John |author2=Julie Wartell |publisher=National Institute of Justice |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosocial theories===
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name=Asghate2011&gt;Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aggressive behavior]] has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: [[serotonin]] systems, [[catecholamine]] systems, and the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]]. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=WALTON K. G. |author2=LEVITSKY D.

===Marxist criminology===
{{Main|Marxist criminology}}
In 1968, young British sociologists formed the [[National Deviancy Symposium|National Deviance Conference]] (NDC) group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. [[Ian Taylor (sociologist)|Ian Taylor]], Paul Walton and [[Jock Young]] – members of the NDC – rejected previous explanations of crime and deviance. Thus, they decided to pursue a new Marxist criminological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The New Criminology'', they argued against the biological "positivism" perspective represented by Lombroso, [[Hans Eysenck]] and Gordon Trasler.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Marxist perspective on crime, "defiance is normal – the sense that men are now consciously involved [...] in assuring their human diversity." Thus Marxists criminologists argued in support of society in which the facts of human diversity, be it social or personal, would not be criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 170 - 171&lt;/ref&gt; They further attributed the processes of crime creation not to genetic or psychological facts, but rather to the material basis of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Charles, C. W. G. Jasperse, K. A. van Leeuwen-Burow. "Criminology Between the Rule of Law and the Outlaws." (1976). Deventer: Kluwer D.V. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convict Criminology===
Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of criminology. Convict criminologists have been directly affected by the [[criminal justice system]], oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminology such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional criminology can better be understood by those who lived in the walls of a prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Stephen C.|last2=Ross|first2=Jeffrey Ian|date=2001|title=Introducing the New School of Convict Criminology|jstor=29768063|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=177–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Leyva argues that "prisonization" oftentimes begins before prison, in the home, community, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leyva|first=Martin|last2=Bickel|first2=Christopher|date=2010|title=From Corrections to College: The Value of a Convict's Voice|url=http://convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|journal=Western Criminology Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=50–60|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809135344/http://www.convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queer Criminology===
Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on [[LGBT]] individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The goals of this field of study are as follows:
* To better understand the history of LGBT individuals and the laws put against the community
* Why LGBT citizens are incarcerated and if or why they are arrested at higher rates than heterosexual and [[cisgender]] individuals
* How queer activists have fought against oppressive laws that criminalized LGBT individuals
* To conduct research and use it as a form of activism through education

====Legitimacy====
The value of pursuing criminology from a queer theorist perspective is contested; some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole, and as a result is a subject that lacks a wide berth of research available. On the other hand, it could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to “queer” the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT communities to liberating and protecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Matthew. "Queer Criminology as Activism." Critical Criminology 24.4 (2016): 473-87. Web. 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and definitions of crime==
Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.  Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon. However, there are two types of laws:
*[[Natural law]]s are rooted in core values shared by many cultures. Natural laws protect against harm to persons (e.g. murder, rape, assault) or property (theft, larceny, robbery), and form the basis of [[common law]] systems.
* [[Statutory law|Statutes]] are enacted by legislatures and reflect current cultural [[mores]], albeit that some laws may be controversial, e.g. laws that prohibit [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use and gambling. Marxist criminology, conflict criminology and critical criminology claim that most relationships between [[state (polity)|state]] and citizen are non-consensual and, as such, [[criminal law]] is not necessarily representative of public beliefs and wishes: it is exercised in the interests of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] or dominant class.  The more right-wing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual [[social contract]] between state and citizen.

Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural norms and mores, but may be broadly classified as [[blue-collar crime]], [[corporate crime]], [[organized crime]], [[political crime]], [[public order crime]], [[state crime]], [[state-corporate crime]], and [[white-collar crime]].&lt;ref&gt;"Attack the System » Crime and Conflict Theory."

'''Erotic hypnosis''' is the practice of [[hypnosis]] for sexual purposes. This does not include [[hypnotherapy]] nor the therapeutic application of [[neurolinguistic programming]] and similar disciplines.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Although often loosely referred to as "recreational hypnosis", recreational hypnosis is a broader subject, including practices like [[stage hypnosis]] and hypnosis for the enjoyment of the practice itself.

== Practice ==
Reducing inhibitions and increasing arousal is a notable goal of erotic hypnosis. The placement of trigger words in the subject's mind as [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] to produce actions and experiences on-demand is a common practice. Erotic hypnosis can also include suggestions intended to improve sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=Angraecus|title=What is Erotic Hypnosis|url=http://www.hypnoticdreams.com/articles/erotic-hypnosis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypnotic suggestions may include techniques to overcome apprehension about [[fellatio]], increase sensuality, and improve [[libido]].

Another common form of erotic hypnosis is hypnotic fantasy, in which the subject is placed in a trance and taken through a description of a sexual experience. Depending on the depth of the trance and the skill of the hypnotist, the subject's experience can range from mildly to deeply erotic.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Personality transformation is another common fantasy. People who identify with the submissive side of erotic hypnosis often fantasize about being freed from responsibilities or inhibitions and transformed into someone who can freely enjoy sexual pleasures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

While there are numerous hypnotic techniques, fractionation—the process of repeatedly bringing someone in and out of trance—is a popular practice in erotic hypnosis.

Fractionation: in regards to seduction is a process of persuasion, combining both psychology and hypnosis.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Power exchange relationships ===
Hypnosis is an increasingly popular practice within a [[dominance and submission]] relationship to reinforce power exchange and as a form of [[Play (BDSM)|play]]. This ranges from hypnotically-induced orgasms to long-term conditioning. The act of hypnosis itself can be erotic and relationship-affirming for many power exchange couples as the subject surrenders control and opens themselves to mental vulnerability.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Kinky Mind Control |journal=Bizarre |issue=223 |pages=74–78 |publisher=Dennis Publishing |date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the January 2015 issue of [[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre]], Alex Tsander, billed therein as "Britain's premier fetish hypnotist", discussing hypnotism in the BDSM context, explicitly distinguished between the use of hypnotic themes in role-play and "real" induced effects. However, the distinction is arguably ambiguous and where one ends and the other begins may be unclear. Tsander himself insists that there is no such thing as a "state of hypnosis" but that hypnotic influence can elicit an authentic sense of loss of control through manipulation of multiple "antecedent variables". In his 2014 book on the topic, "Beyond Games of Trance", Tsander repeatedly warns about the clearly defined ethical scope within which the techniques he outlines for achieving such results can be considered acceptable.

== Non-hypnotic elements ==
Certain other practices such as persuasion techniques, conditioning, and neurolinguistic programming are often associated with erotic hypnosis, but are not strictly a part of it.

== Adult industry ==
Erotic hypnosis is a huge fetish in the adult industry.{{cn|date=April 2018}} It can be videos or audio.

== Social communities ==
Communities that are involved in erotic hypnosis are found on hypnomindcontrol.net, justtrance.net, and bondage.international. Those who use it need an IRC client or similar for access. Hypnomindcontrol.net and justtrance.net are networks dedicated exclusively to erotic hypnosis. Chatrooms such as these are used by those who enjoy erotic hypnosis. On [[Reddit]]/GoneWildAudio contains the most significant community of erotic hypnotists as well as hosting other erotic audio, other more exclusive subreddits also exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">'''Ethnoscience''' has been defined as an attempt "to reconstitute what serves as science for others, their practices of looking after themselves and their bodies, their botanical knowledge, but also their forms of classification, of making connections, etc." (Augé, 1999: 118).

==Origins==
Ethnoscience has not always focused on ideas distinct from those of "[[cognitive anthropology]]", "component analysis", or "the New Ethnography"; it is a specialization of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] knowledge-systems, such as ethno-botany, ethno-zoology, ethno-medicine, etc. (Atran, 1991: 595). According to [[Scott Atran]], ethnoscience looks at culture with a scientific perspective (1991: 650), although most{{quantify|date=November 2017}} anthropologists abhor this definition. Ethnoscience helps to understand how people develop with different forms of knowledge and beliefs, and focuses on the ecological and historical contributions people have been given (Atran, 1991: 650){{by whom|date=November 2017}}. [[Tim Ingold]] describes ethnoscience as a cross-discipline (2000: 160). He writes that ethnoscience is based on increased collaboration between [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]] (e.g., [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[philosophy]]) with [[natural sciences]] such as [[biology]], [[ecology]], or [[medicine]] (Ingold, 2000: 406-7). At the same time, ethnoscience is increasingly transdisciplinary in its nature (Ingold, 2000: 407).

Of course, naturally over time, the ways in which data has been collected and studied has changed and the field has evolved, becoming more detailed and specific (Urry, 1972: 45).{{qn|date=November 2017}} The ideas, mechanics, and methods of ethnoscience evolved from something else - a combination of several things. This pretext amalgamation{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} of theories, processes, and –isms led to the evolution of today's ethnoscience.

==Early approaches==
Early on, [[Franz Boas]] established [[cultural relativism]] as an approach to understanding indigenous scientific practices (Uddin, 2005: 980). Cultural relativism identifies people's differences and shows how they are a result of the social, historical, and geographical conditions (Uddin, 2005: 980). Boas is known for his work in Northern [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, working with the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] Indians, which is where he established the importance of culture (Uddin, 2005: 980). [[Lévi-Strauss]]' [[structuralism]] was a strong contributor to the ideas of ethnoscience (Uddin, 2005: 980). It, itself, was the leading idea of providing structure to the research and a guide to organizing and relating different cultures. "Ethnoscience refers to a 'reduction of chaos' achieved by a particular culture, rather than to the 'highest possible and conscious degree' to which such chaos may be reduced;" basically, the ethnoscience of a society creates its culture (Sturtevant, 1964: 100). Much of the influence of anthropology, e.g., [[geographical determinism]], was through the contributions of [[Jean Bodin]] (Harris, 1968: 42). In his text, he tried to explain why "northern people were faithful, loyal to the government, cruel, and sexually uninterested, compared to why southern people were malicious, craft, wise, expert in science but ill-adapted to political activity (Harris, 1968: 52)." The Greek historian, [[Polybius]], asserted "we mortals have an irresistible tendency to yield to climatic influences; and to this cause, and no other, may be traced the great distinctions that prevail among us in character, physical formation, complexion, as well as in most of our habits…" (quoted in Harris, 1968: 41).

Another aspect of anthropology prior to ethnoscience is [[enculturation]]. Newton and Newton described enculturation as a process whereby the novice, or "outsider", learns what is important to the "insider" (1998). [[Marvin Harris]] writes, "One of [enculturation's] most important technical expressions is the doctrine of 'psychic unity,' the belief that in the study of sociocultural differences, hereditary (genetic) differences cancel each other out, leaving 'experience' as the most significant variable" (Harris, 1968: 15). This is one of the many starts of people opening up to the idea that just because people are different, doesn't mean they are wrong in their thinking. Harris describes how religious beliefs hinder and affect the progress of anthropology and [[ethnography]]. The moral beliefs and restrictions of religion fought against anthropological ideas, possibly due to (especially at the time) to the newly hyped idea of [[evolutionism]] and [[Darwinism]] (Harris, 1968).

[[Bronislaw Malinowski]] was one of many who contributed heavily to the precursor of ethnoscience. His earlier work brought attention to [[sociological]] studies; his earliest publication focused on a family in [[Australia]], using a sociological study perspective (Harris, 1968: 547). After the [[First World War]], anthropological work was at a stand still; nothing had evolved, if not regressed (Urry, 1972: 54). This allowed him to start from scratch, and rebuild his ideas and methods (Harris, 1968: 547).

Later, however, Malinowski branched out to political evolution during [[World War II]]. The period after World War II is what led to ethnoscience; anthropologists learned their skills could be applied to problems that were affecting modern societies (Mead, 1973: 1). Malinowski said "… with his tables of [[kinship terms]], [[genealogies]], maps, plans and diagrams, proves an extensive and big organization, shows the contribution of the tribe, of the clan, of the family, and he gives a picture of the natives subjected to a strict code of behavior and good manners, to which in comparison the life at the [[Court of Versailles]] or [[Escurial]] was free and easy" (1922: 10). After World War II, there was an extreme amount of growth in the anthropological field, not only with research opportunities but academically, as well (Mead, 1973: 2).

The anthropologist [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]], who taught at several Nigerian universities, considered the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples as incorporated within conceptual world views that bear certain similarities to, and differences from, the modern scientific worldview.  Like modern science, traditional thought provides a theoretical structure that "places things in a causal order wider than that provided by common sense" (Horton, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;53).  In contrast to modern science, he saw traditional thought as having a limited awareness of theoretical alternatives and, consequently, displaying "an absolute acceptance of the established theoretical tenets" (Horton, 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–6).

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of related methods and processes that preceded ethnoscience. Ethnoscience is just another way to study the human culture and the way people interact in society. Taking a look at the ideas and analyses prior to ethnoscience can help understand why it was developed in the first place. Although, it is not widely used and there is criticism on both ends, ethnoscience allows for a more comprehensive way to collect data and patterns of a people. This is not to say the process is its best or that there will be nothing better. That is the best part: everything evolves, even thought. Just as the ideas did in the past, they can improve over time and regress over time but change is inevitable.

==Development==

Ethnoscience is a new term and study that came into anthropological theory in the 1960s. Often referred to as "indigenous knowledge", ethnoscience introduces a perspective based on native perceptions. It is based on a complete emic perspective, which excludes all observations, interpretations and or any personal notions belonging to the ethnographer. The taxonomy and classification of indigenous systems, to name a few, used to categorize plants, animals, religion and life is adapted from a linguistic analysis. The concept of "Native Science" is also related to the understanding the role of the environment intertwined with the meaning humans place upon their lives. Understanding the language and the native people's linguistic system is one method to understand a native people's system of knowledge of organization. Not only is there categorization for things pertaining to nature and culture thought language, but more importantly and complex is the relationship between environment and culture. Ethnoscience looks at the intricacies of the connection between culture and its surrounding environment. There are also potential limitations and shortcomings in interpreting these systems of knowledge as a dictation of culture and behavior.

Since an ethnographer is not able to physically enter inside an indigenous person's mind, it is essential to not only create a setting or question-answer format to understand perspective but to analyze semantics and word order of given answer to derive an emic understanding. The main focus on a particular component of the languages is placed on its [[lexicon]]. The terms "[[etic]]" and "[[emic]]" are derived from the [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms of "[[phonetic]]" and "[[phonemic]]".

As introduced by [[Gregory Cajete]], some limitations the concept of indigenous knowledge, is the potential to bypass non-indigenous knowledge as pertinent and valuable. The labels of "indigenous" are overly accepted by those who seek more support by outsiders to further their cause. There might also be an unequal distribution of knowledge amongst a tribe or peoples. There is also the idea that culture is bound by environment. Some theorists conclude that indigenous people's culture is not operated by mental concentrations but solely by the earth that surrounds them. Some theorists go the extent to state that biological processes are based upon the availability, of lack thereof, environmental resources. The methods for sustainability are founded through the workings of the land. These techniques are exercised from the basis of tradition. The importance of the combination of ecological process, social structures, environmental ethics and spiritual ecology are crucial to the expression of the true connection between the natural world and "ecological consciousness".

The origin of Ethnoscience began between the years 1960 to 1965; deriving from the concept of "ethno- + science". Ethno- a combining form meaning "race", "culture", "people", used in the formation of compound words: ethnography. The two concepts later emerged into "ethno-science". The origin of the word 'science' involves the empiric observation of measurable quantities and the testing of hypotheses to falsify or support them. 
"Ethnoscience refers to the system of knowledge and cognition typical of a given culture...to put it another way a culture itself amounts to the sum of a given society's folk classifications, all of that society's ethnoscience, its particular ways of classifying its material and social universe" (Sturtevant 1964: 99–100). The aim of ethnoscience is to gain a more complete description of cultural knowledge. Ethnoscience has been successfully used on several studies of given cultures relating to their linguistics, folk taxonomy, and how they classify their foods, animals and plants.

===Ethnolinguistics===

Ethnoscience is the examination of the perceptions, knowledge, and classifications of the world as reflected in their use of language, which can help anthropologists understand a given culture. By using an ethnographic approach to studying a culture and learning their lexicon and syntax they are able to gain more knowledge in understanding how a particular culture classifies its material and social universe. In addition, this approach "adopted provides simultaneously a point at which the discipline of linguistics, or at least some of its general attitudes, may sensibly be used in anthropology and as a means of gaining insight not only into the nature of man but also into the nature of culture" (Videbeck and Pia, 1966).

Researchers can use linguistics to study what a given culture considers important in a given situation or unforeseen event, and can rank those potential situations in terms of their likelihood to recur. In addition, "understanding the contingencies is helpful in the task of comprehending folk taxonomies on the one hand, and, on the other, an understanding of the taxonomy is required for a full scale appreciation of criteria considered relevant in a given culture (Videbeck and Pia, 1966).

===Taxonomy and classification===

Ethnoscience can be used to analyze the kinship terminology of a given culture, using their language and according to how they view members of their society. Taxonomies "are models of analysis whose purpose is the description of particular types of hierarchical relationships between members of a given set of elements" (Perchonock and [[Oswald Werner|Werner]], 1969). For example, in our society we classify family groups by giving members the title of father, mother, sister, daughter, brother, son, grandfather, grandmother, etc.

===System of classification – among cultures===

Ethnoscience deals with how a given culture classifies certain principles in addition to how it is express through their language. By understanding a given culture through how they view the world, anthropologists attempt to eliminate any bias through translation as well as categorized their principles in their own ways. "The new methods, which focus on the discovery and description of folk systems, have come to be known as Ethnoscience. Ethnoscience analysis has thus far concentrated on systems of classification within such cultural and linguistic domains as colors, plants, and medicines" (Perchonock and [[Oswald Werner|Werner]], 1969). An ethnoscientific approach can be used to better understand a given culture and their knowledge of their culture. Using an ethnographic approach can help anthropologists understand how that given culture views and categorizes their own foods, animal kingdom, medicines, as well as plants.

===Contemporary research===
Ethnoscience can be effectively summed up as a classification system for a particular culture in the same way that a botanist would use a taxonomic system for the classification of plant species. Everything from class levels, food consumption, clothing, and material culture objects would be subjected to a taxonomic classification system. In essence, ethnoscience is a way of classifying cultural systems in a structured order to better understand the culture.
The roots of ethnoscience can be traced back to influential anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]], [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]] who attempted to understand other cultures from an insider's perspective. [[Ward Goodenough]] is accredited for bringing ethnoscience to the stage when he define cultural systems of knowledge by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"A societies culture consists of whatever it is one has to know or believe in order to operate in a manner acceptable to its members. Culture is not a material phenomenon; it does not consist of things, behavior, or emotions. It is rather an organization of these things. It is the form of things that people have in mind, their models for perceiving, relating, and otherwise interpreting them."
'' (Goodenough 1957:167)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In order to properly put ethnoscience in context we must first understand the definition of ethnoscience. it is defined as "an attempt at cultural description from a totally emic perspective (a perspective in ethnography that uses the concepts and categories that are relevant and meaningful to the culture that is insider analysis) standpoint, this eliminating all of the ethnographer's own categories" (Morey and Luthans 27). Ethnoscience is also a way of learning and understanding how an individual or group perceive their environment and how they fit in with their environment as reflected in their own words and actions.

Ethnoscience has many techniques when applied to an emic perspective. Ethnosemantics, ethnographic semantics, ethnographic ethnoscience, formal analysis, and componential analysis are the terms that apply to the practice of ethnoscience. Ethnosemantics looks at the meaning of words in order to place them in context of the culture being studied. It allows for taxonomy of a certain part of the culture being looked at so that there is a clear breakdown which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of the subject at hand. Ethnographic semantics are very similar to cognitive anthropology in that its primary focus is the intellectual and rational perspectives of the culture being studied. Ethnographic semantics specifically looks at how language is used throughout the culture. Lastly, ethnographic ethnoscience is related to ethnosemantics such that, it uses a taxonomic system to understand how cultural knowledge is accessible through language. Ethnographic ethnoscience uses similar classification systems for cultural domains like ethnobotany and ethnoanatomy. Again, ethnoscience is a way of understanding a how a culture sees itself through its own language. Understanding the cultural language allows the ethnographer to have a deeper and more intimate understanding of the culture.

'''Fusicoccins''' are [[organic compound]]s produced by a [[fungus]]. It has detrimental effect on [[plant]]s and causes their [[death]].

Fusicoccins are diterpenoid glycosides produced by the fungus ''[[Fusicoccum amygdali]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ballio, A. |author2=Chain, E. B. |author3=De Leo, P. |author4=Erlanger, B.

It stimulates a quick acidification of the plant [[cell wall]]; this causes the [[stoma]]ta to irreversibly open, which brings about the death of the plant.

Fusicoccins contains three fused [[carbon]] rings and another ring which contains an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] and five carbons.

Fusicoccin was and is extensively used in research regarding the [[plant hormone]] [[auxin]] and its mechanisms.

==Biosynthesis==
Fusicoccin is a member of a diterpenoid class which shares a 5-8-5 ring structure and is called fusicoccane.&lt;ref name="pmid22465041"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Boer AH, de Vries-van Leeuwen IJ |title=Fusicoccanes: diterpenes with surprising biological functions |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=360–368 |year=2012 |pmid=22465041 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2012.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fungi, fusicoccin is biosynthesized via ''Phomopsis amygdali'' fusicoccadiene synthase (PaFS) from universal C5 [[isoprene]] units [[dimethylallyl diphosphate]] (DMAPP) and [[isopentenyl diphosphate]] (IPP). PaFS has two domains, a C-terminal prenyltransferase domain which converts isoprene units into [[geranylgeranyl diphosphate]] (GGDP) and an N-terminal terpene cyclase domain where GGDP gets cyclized and turns into fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene. It is also reported in this study that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase-like gene, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-like gene, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase-like gene, and an α-mannosidase-like gene at the 3’ location downstream of PaFS which are responsible for converting fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene into fusicoccin.&lt;ref name="pmid17360612"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Toyomasu T, Tsukahara M, Kaneko A, Niida R, Mitsuhashi W, Dairi T, Kato N, Sassa T |title=Fusicoccins are biosynthesized by an unusual chimera diterpene synthase in fungi |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue=9 |pages=3084–3088 |year=2007 |pmid=17360612 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608426104 |pmc=1805559}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two enzymes, one dioxygenase and PAPT, are in charge of catalyzing a hydroxylation at the 3-position of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8β,16-diol and prenylation of the hydroxyl group of [[glucose]] in fusicoccin P, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid21299202"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ono Y, Minami A, Noike M, Higuchi Y, Toyoasu T, Sassa T, Kato N, Dairi T |title=Dioxygenases, keyenzymes to determine the aglycon structures of fusicoccin and brassicicene, diterpene compounds produced by fungi |journal=J.

'''Gene mapping''' describes the methods used to identify the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of a gene and the distances between genes.&lt;ref name="Lister Hill"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gene mapping - Glossary Entry |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=genemapping|date=2013-09-03|work=[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]|publisher=Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications,  an Intramural Research Division of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]|accessdate=2013-09-06|location=Bethesda, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of all [[genome]] mapping is to place a collection of molecular markers onto their respective positions on the genome. [[Molecular marker]]s come in all forms. Genes can be viewed as one special type of genetic markers in the construction of genome maps, and mapped the same way as any other markers.

==Genetic mapping vs physical mapping==
There are two distinctive types of "Maps" used in the field of genome mapping: genetic maps and physical maps. While both maps are a collection of [[genetic markers]] and gene loci, genetic maps' distances are based on the genetic linkage information, while physical maps use actual physical distances usually measured in number of base pairs. While the physical map could be a more "accurate" representation of the genome, genetic maps often offer insights into the nature of different regions of the chromosome, e.g. the genetic distance to physical distance ratio varies greatly at different genomic regions which reflects different recombination rates, and such rate is often indicative of euchromatic (usually gene-rich) vs heterochromatic (usually gene poor) regions of the genome.

===Gene mapping===
Researchers begin a genetic map by collecting samples of blood or tissue from family members that carry a prominent disease or trait and family members that don't. Scientists then isolate DNA from the samples and closely examine it, looking for unique patterns in the DNA of the family members who do carry the disease that the DNA of those who don't carry the disease don't have. These unique molecular patterns in the DNA are referred to as polymorphisms, or markers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genome.gov/10000715&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steps of building a genetic map are the development of [[genetic marker]]s and a mapping population. The closer two markers are on the chromosome, the more likely they are to be passed on to the next generation together. Therefore, the "co-segregation" patterns of all markers can be used to reconstruct their order. With this in mind, the genotypes of each genetic marker are recorded for both parents and each individual in the following generations. The quality of the genetic maps is largely dependent upon these factors: the number of genetic markers on the map and the size of the mapping population. The two factors are interlinked, as a larger mapping population could increase the "resolution" of the map and prevent the map being "saturated".

In gene mapping, any sequence feature that can be faithfully distinguished from the two parents can be used as a genetic marker. Genes, in this regard, are represented by "traits" that can be faithfully distinguished between two parents. Their linkage with other genetic markers are calculated in the same way as if they are common markers and the actual gene loci are then bracketed in a region between the two nearest neighbouring markers. The entire process is then repeated by looking at more markers which target that region to map the gene neighbourhood to a higher resolution until a specific causative locus can be identified. This process is often referred to as "[[positional cloning]]", and it is used extensively in the study of plant species
The great advantage of genetic mapping is that it can identify the relative position of genes based solely on their phenotypic effect.

===Physical mapping===
Since actual base-pair distances are generally hard or impossible to directly measure, physical maps are actually constructed by first shattering the genome into hierarchically smaller pieces. By characterizing each single piece and assembling back together, the overlapping path or "tiling path" of these small fragments would allow researchers to infer physical distances between genomic features. The fragmentation of the genome can be achieved by [[restriction enzyme]] cutting or by physically shattering the genome by processes like sonication. Once cut, the DNA fragments are separated by [[electrophoresis]]. The resulting pattern of DNA migration (i.e. its [[genetic fingerprint]]) is used to identify what stretch of DNA is in the [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]. By analyzing the fingerprints, [[contig]]s are assembled by automated (FPC) or manual means (pathfinders) into overlapping DNA stretches. Now a good choice of clones can be made to efficiently sequence the clones to determine the DNA sequence of the organism under study.

In physical mapping, there are no direct ways of marking up a specific gene since the mapping does not include any information that concerns traits and functions. Genetic markers can be linked to a physical map by processes like [[in situ hybridization]]. By this approach, physical map contigs can be "anchored" onto a genetic map. The clones used in the physical map contigs can then be sequenced on a local scale to help new genetic marker design and identification of the causative loci.

Macrorestriction is a type of physical mapping wherein the high molecular weight DNA is digested with a restriction enzyme having a low number of restriction sites.

There are alternative ways to determine how [[DNA]] in a group of clones overlaps without completely sequencing the clones. Once the map is determined, the clones can be used as a resource to efficiently contain large stretches of the genome. This type of mapping is more accurate than genetic maps.

===Genome sequencing===
Genome sequencing is sometimes mistakenly referred to as "genome mapping" by non-biologists. The process of "shotgun sequencing" resembles the process of physical mapping: it shatters the genome into small fragments, characterizes each fragment, then puts them back together (more recent sequencing technologies are drastically different). While the scope, purpose and process are totally different, a genome assembly can be viewed as the "ultimate" form of physical map, in that it provides in a much better way all the information that a traditional physical map can offer.

==Use==
Identification of genes is usually the first step in understanding a genome of a species; mapping of the gene is usually the first step of identification of the gene. Gene mapping is usually the starting point of many important downstream studies.

===Disease association===
The process to identify a genetic element that is responsible for a [[disease]] is also referred to as "mapping". If the locus in which the search is performed is already considerably constrained, the search is called the ''fine mapping'' of a gene. This information is derived from the investigation of disease manifestations in large families ([[genetic linkage]]) or from populations-based [[genetic association]] studies.

'''Gregory Buchakjian''' (born 1971, in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]) is a Lebanese photographer, filmmaker and art historian. He studied at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]. He teaches at [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts|Académie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts ALBA]] and was co founder, with architects Pierre Hage Boutros and Rana Haddad, of [[Atelier de Recherche ALBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centreimage.ch/cic_archives/02progF/expos/2004/formidable_beyrouth_f.html |title=Formidable Beyrouth ! |author= |year=2004 |work= |publisher=[[Centre pour l’image contemporaine]] - [[Saint-Gervais (Geneva)]] |accessdate=22 January 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory Buchakjian is member of the advisory committee of the Saradar Collection, devoted to Lebanese art from the contemporary and modern periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saradar.com/English/SaradarCollection |title=Saradar Collection - Saradar Group |author= |year=2015 |work= |publisher=Saradar |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Gregory Buchakjian emerged in the art scene after the [[2006 Lebanon War]] within a collective of Lebanese filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East. A Dictionary

&lt;/ref&gt; presented part of the ''Videos Under Siege'' project featured in the [[Dubai International Film Festival]] 2008.

In the following years, he slipped into Beirut’s vibrant and underground nightlife. His photographs depict sensuality although violence and anxiety remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lalettredelaphotographie.com/entries/4159/|title= Gregory Buchakjian  Nighthawks |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher= La Lettre de la Photographie |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking its name "Nighthawks" from [[Nighthawks|a famous painting]] by [[Edward Hopper]], the project was exhibited in [[Der Aa-kerk]], [[Groningen]] as part of the 18th [[Noorderlicht]] Photofestival 2011: Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.photography-now.com/artists/K42889.html |title= Gregory Buchakjian  - Exhibitions |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher= Photography Now: The international online platform for Photography and Video Art |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2016, Gregory Buchakjian constituted a long term projet devoted to abandoned dwellings in Beirut, that developed as  photographic interpretation of the derelict interiors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1044051/video-art-in-beirut-photographer-gregory-buchakjian-abandoned# |title= VIDEO: Art in Beirut—Photographer Gregory Buchakjian, Abandoned Sensuality |author=Eric Gonon |date=8 July 2014 |work= |publisher= Blouin ArtInfo |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew into an extensive research and a PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paris-sorbonne.fr/M-GREGORY-BUCHAKJIAN-Habitats |title= M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">[[Image:Hock.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Diagram showing the location of the hock.]]
The '''hock''', or '''gambrel''', is the joint between the [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal bones]] and [[tibia]] of a [[digitigrade]] or [[unguligrade]] [[quadrupedal]] mammal, such as a [[horse]], [[cat]], or [[dog]].   This joint may include articulations between tarsal bones and the [[fibula]] in some species (such as cats), while in others the fibula has been greatly reduced and is only found as a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] remnant fused to the distal portion of the tibia (as in horses) {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.  It is the anatomical [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[ankle]] of the human [[foot]].  While homologous joints occur in other [[tetrapod]]s, the term is generally restricted to mammals, particularly long-legged [[domestic animals|domesticated species]].

==Horse==
Although the ''tarsus'' refers specifically to the bones and joints of the hock, most people working with horses refer to the ''hock'' in such a way to include the bones, joints, and soft tissue of the area. The hock is especially important in [[equine anatomy]], due to the great strain it receives when the horse is worked. Jumping, and movements that require collection, are some of the more stressful activities.

===Primary joints and bones of the hock===
In the horse, the hock consists of multiple joints, namely:
*Tibiotarsal or tarsocrural joint
*Proximal intertarsal joint or talocalcanealcentroquartal joint
*Distal intertarsal joint or centrodistal joint
*Tarsometatarsal joint
*Talocalcaneal joint

In the horse, the hock consists of the following bones
*[[Talus bone|Talus]]
*[[Calcaneus]]
*Central [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] bone
*3rd tarsal bone
*3rd metatarsal bone
*4th tarsal bone
*Fused 1st and 2nd tarsal bone

===Equine disease states===
*Horses may suffer from  "capped hock", which is caused by the creation of a false [[bursa (anatomy)|bursa]], a [[synovial bursa|synovial]] sac beneath the skin. Capped hock is usually caused by [[Blunt trauma|trauma]] such as kicking or slipping when attempting to stand. In the absence of a wound, it does not require immediate veterinary attention and is usually only of cosmetic significance. On the other hand, a wound into the calcanean bursa is a serious problem. A capped hock is extremely unlikely to be a cause of [[lameness (equine)|lameness]], even if severe.
*[[Osteochondrosis dissecans]], or OCD is a developmental defect in the cartilage or of cartilage and bone seen in particular locations on the surface of the tarsocrural joint.  This condition is typically discovered when the horse is young, and is one cause of [[bog spavin]].  After surgery to remove bone and cartilage fragments most horses can return to full work.
*Distension of the tibiotarsal joint with excessive joint fluid and/or [[synovium]] is called [[bog spavin]].
*Degenerative joint disease of the tarsometatarsal or distal intertarsal joint is referred to as [[bone spavin]].
*[[Curb (horse)|Curb]], or tarsal plantar desmitis, is traditionally considered a sprain of the plantar ligament, which runs down the back of the hock, serving functionally as a tension band connecting the calcaneus, the fourth tarsal bone and the fourth metatatarsal bone.  Recent work has shown that curb can be caused by damage to one of many soft tissue structures in this region.
*[[Stringhalt]]

===Conformational defects===
''Also see [[equine conformation]]''

Because the hock takes a great deal of strain in all performance disciplines, correct [[equine conformation|conformation]] is essential if the horse is to have a sound and productive working life. Common conformational defects include [[sickle-hocked|sickle hocks]], [[post-legged]] conformation/straight hocks, [[cow-hocked|cow hocks]], and bowed hocks. Depending on the use of the horse, some defects may be more acceptable than others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">''' House of Yahweh ostracon''' is the name sometimes given to Ostracon 18, a pottery sherd dated to the 6th century BCE found with a collection of other ostraca in the excavation of [[Tel Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel exploration journal reader. 1 (1981) edited by Harry Meyer Orlinsky P:7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Life in Biblical Times By Oded Borowski P103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/arad.html|title=Ancient Arad|website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription read as follow:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
To my lord Eliashib
May YHWH inquire after your well-being. 
And now, give to Shemaryahu a measure (of flour), and to the Kerosite you will give a measure (of flour). 
And concerning the matter about which you commanded me, it is well. 
He is staying in the house of YHWH.”
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

More than 100 ancient [[Ostracon|ostraca]] with [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo–Hebrew]] inscriptions were found on the same spot as well as at the Israelite Temple destroyed in 8th century BCE.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; As the temple of [[Tel Arad|Arad]] was already destroyed by the 6th century BCE, and as the ostraca refer to the place from where it was sent, after the period of [[Josiah]]'s religious reforms and the concentration of worship in Jerusalem, the temple referred to by the ostracon seems to be the [[First Temple|one in Jerusalem]], which if true would make the ostraca the only direct proof of the [[First Temple]]'s existence thusfar uncovered by archeology. This is further in accord with the fact that one of the bearers of the letter is a Kerosite, possibly related to the [[Nethinim]] that some consider to have been Temple slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521227179|page=397|author=T.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9407">In [[cosmology]] and [[general relativity]], '''inhomogeneous cosmology''' in the most general sense (totally inhomogeneous universe) is modelling the universe as a whole with the spacetime which does not possess any [[spacetime symmetries]]. Typically considered cosmological spacetimes have either the maximal symmetry which composes of three translational symmetries and three rotational symmetries (homogeneity and isotropy with respect to every point of spacetime), the translational symmetry only (homogeneous models), or the rotational symmetry only (spherically symmetric models). Models with less symmetries (e.g. axisymmetric) are also considered as symmetric. However, it is common to call spherically symmetric models or non-homogeneous models as inhomogeneous. In inhomogeneous cosmology the large-scale structure of the universe is modelled by exact solutions of the Einstein field equations (i.e. non-perturbatively) unlike in the theory of cosmological perturbations which is the study of the Universe that takes [[structure formation]] ([[galaxy|galaxies]], [[galaxy cluster]]s, the [[cosmic web]]) into account, but in a perturbative way.&lt;ref name="KrasinsikiInhom" /&gt;

This usually includes the study of structure in the Universe by means of exact solutions of [[Einstein's field equations]] (i.e. ''[[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metrics]]'')&lt;ref name="KrasinsikiInhom" /&gt; or by spatial or spacetime averaging methods.&lt;ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" /&gt;

==Homogeneity==

Such models are not [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="RyanShepley" /&gt; but may allow effects which can be interpreted as [[dark energy]], or can lead to cosmological structures such as voids or galaxy clusters.&lt;ref name="KrasinsikiInhom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" /&gt;

==Perturbative approach==

In contrast, [[perturbation theory]], which deals with small perturbations from e.g. a homogeneous metric, only holds as long as the perturbations are not too large, and N-body simulations use Newtonian gravity which is only a good approximation when speeds are low and gravitational fields are weak.

==Non-perturbative approach==

Work towards a non-perturbative approach includes the Relativistic Zel'dovich Approximation.&lt;ref name="BuchertRZA2"/&gt; {{As of|2016}}, Thomas Buchert, [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]], [[Edward Kolb]] and their colleagues,&lt;ref name="Buchert11" /&gt; judged that if the Universe is described by cosmic variables in a backreaction scheme that includes coarse-graining and averaging, then the question of whether dark energy is an artefact of the way of using the Einstein equation is an unanswered question.&lt;ref name="Buchert11_CQGplus" /&gt;

==Exact solutions==

The first historically examples of inhomogeneous (though spherically symmetric) solutions are the [[Lemaître–Tolman metric]] (or LTB model - Lemaître–Tolman-Bondi &lt;ref name="L" /&gt;&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;). [[Stephani metric]] &lt;ref name="Stephani" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Dabrowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Balcerzak" /&gt; can be spherically symmetric or totally inhomogeneous. Some other examples are the Szekeres metric, Szafron metric, Barnes metric, Kustaanheimo-Qvist metric, and Senovilla metric.&lt;ref name="KrasinsikiInhom" /&gt; The Bianchi metrics as given in [[Bianchi classification]] and [[Kantowski-Sachs metrics]] are homogeneous.

==Averaging methods==
The best-known{{according to whom|date=May 2017}} averaging approach is the scalar averaging approach{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}, leading to the kinematical [[back-reaction|backreaction]] and mean 3-Ricci curvature functionals;&lt;ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" /&gt; the main equations are often referred to as the set of [[Buchert equations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">A '''Jihad satire''' is a [[political satire]] that satirizes the idea of violent [[jihad]].

==As art==

The musical comedy ''[[Jihad! The Musical]]'' and the film ''[[Four Lions]]'' are works of art that satirise jihadis.&lt;ref name="Gardham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7594722/We-should-laugh-at-al-Qaeda-says-report.html|title=We should laugh at al-Qaeda, says report|last=Gardham|first=Duncan|date=April 16, 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wannabe-suicide-bombers-beware-chris-morris-movie-gets-goahead-1228152.html |title=Wannabe suicide bombers beware: Chris Morris movie gets go-ahead |first=Geneviève |last=Roberts |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJstaff&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/17/trailer-for-jihad-satire-four-lions-debuts/  "'Four Lions' Jihad Satire Trailer Debuts,"] March 17, 2010, Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTrib&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/7266/counter-terrorism-comedy/ "Counter-terrorism comedy,"] International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Australian]]'' describes ''Four Lions'' as "a satire on Islamic jihadism and its murderous ambitions."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/jokes-on-jihad/story-e6frg8n6-1225906260351 "Jokes on jihad,"] Evan Williams, August 21, 2010, The Australian.&lt;/ref&gt;   The satirical ''Jihad! The Musical'' featured a hero who cheerfully sang, "I wanna be like Osama, I wanna bomb a path to fame across the Earth.  People may abhor me but by God, they won't ignore me, When the CIA determines what I'm worth."&lt;ref name=Gifford&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13923077 "Fringe Fest 'Jihad' Musical Touches Explosive Topics,"] Rob Gifford, Aug, 24, 2007, National Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Jeff Dunham]]'s puppet character "Achmed the dead [[Islamic terrorism|terrorist]]" is a popular example of jihad satire in the United States.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1901490,00.html Belinda Luscombe. "The Puppet Master" ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine; June 8, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;  Achmed is a puppet who shouts, "Silence, I kill you!" whenever the audience laughs at something that offends his sensibilities.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;Achmed the dead terrorist and humor in popular geopolitics, Darren Purcell, Melissa Scott Brown and Mahmut Gokmen, GeoJournal, 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunham explains that he portrays Achmed as incompetent so that when the audience realise that the character is "a bumbling idiot with problems in life", they appreciate that he is human.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;

==As healing==

Mental health professionals argue that humor and satire can alleviate the mental health impact of terror attacks, helping to heal the survivors of terror attacks and rescue personnel suffering the consequences of exposure to the horrors of deliberate mass murder.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Anne Pasquali, "Humor; An Antidote for Terrorism", ''[[Journal of Holistic Nursing]]'', Vol. 21, No. 4, 398-414 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Michael Bongar, ''Psychology of Terrorism'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mental health's role in combating terror,’" Derrick Hamaoka, Jun Shigemura, Molly Hall, Robert Ursano, ''Journal of Mental Health,'' 2004, Vol. 13, No. 6 : Pages 531-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political strategy==

Arab-American comedian [[Ray Hanania]] has written, "If there were a bit of humor in the Middle East, I think that there might not be so much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the environment that breeds fanaticism and terrorism."&lt;ref name=Hanania&gt;Ray Hanania, ''I'm Glad I Look Like a Terrorist: Growing up Arab in America,'' U. S. G. Publishing, 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Psychology Today]]'',  humor is the most powerful tool to prevent individuals from becoming  Islamic suicide bombers, however, to be effective, the humor has to come from within the Muslim community and it has to be "aimed at the culture's sacred values."&lt;ref name=Fong&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-me-in-we/201001/comedy-counter-terrorism  “Comedy as Counter-Terrorism; Comedy as a Strategy of Counter-Terrorism,”] Molly Castelloe Fong, Ph.D. , Jan 26, 2010, Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Molly Castelloe Fong, "Humor has the potential to gradually, over time, alter what it means to be a heroic martyr in the mind of extremist groups."&lt;ref name=Fong/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] has reported that "Satire and ridicule can help win the fight against Al-Qaeda by stripping it of its glamour and mystique."&lt;ref name=Moutot&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtBqws_tP_7eOFEw0cdih33DNN_A "Fight Al-Qaeda with satire, ridicule: researchers"], Michel Moutot (AFP) – Apr 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63E6JT20100415 “Defeat al Qaeda by removing its "cool" image; The way to beat al Qaeda and stop Islamist groups gaining recruits to violent causes is to remove their "cool" image and make fun of terrorists instead, according to a major international study published on Friday,”] Michael Holden, April 15, 2010, Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] group, a think tank in the United Kingdom, is among the academic institutions that have suggested that satire can be an effective tool in undermining support for  violent jihad.&lt;ref name=Gardham/&gt;  According to some terrorism experts, successful recruitment for violent jihad depends upon convincing potential recruits that jihadis are "pious warriors of God". They postulate that by "highlighting their incompetence, their moral failings, and their embarrassing antics", it may be possible to "undermine" support for violent jihadi organizations including [[Al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name="Byman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-case-for-calling-them-nitwits/8130/|title=The Case for Calling Them Nitwits|last=Fair|first=Christine|date=July–August 2010|publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers for Demos recommend satire as a means of undermining the popularity of violent jihad, noting that "satire has long been recognised as a powerful tool to undermine the popularity of social movements: both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[British Union of Fascists|British Fascist party]] in the 1930s were seriously harmed by sustained satire."&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theedgeofviolence  ‘’The Edge of Violence, A Radical Approach to Extremism,’’] Jamie Bartlett, Jonathan Birdwell, April 16, 2010, Demos, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Allen Paulos''' (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He has gained fame as a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of [[numeracy|mathematical literacy]]. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical [[innumeracy]]; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability, and logic.

==Early life==
Paulos was born in [[Denver Colorado]] and grew up in Chicago, [[Illinois]] and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. In an interview he described himself as lifelong skeptic.&lt;ref name=Podcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Skeptics!|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|publisher=Christopher Brown|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062748/http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to high school in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. After his Bachelor of Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967) and his  Master of Science at [[University of Washington]] (1968) he received his [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1974). He was also part of the [[Peace Corps]] in the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNDB|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/786/000041663/|publisher=NNDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic work is mainly in [[mathematical logic]] and [[probability theory]].

His book ''[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences]]'' (1988) was a bestseller and ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses [[innumeracy]] with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way.

He has also written on other subjects often "combining disparate disciplines", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in ''Mathematics and Humor'' and ''I Think, Therefore I Laugh'', the [[stock market]] in ''A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market'', quantitative aspects of narrative in ''Once Upon a Number'', the arguments for God in ''Irreligion'', and most recently "bringing mathematics to bear on...biography" in ''A Numerate Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |interviewer=Jim Stein |title=A Numerate Life: A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours |url=http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |date=10 November 2015 |work=New Books in Mathematics |access-date=24 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115193717/http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |archivedate=January 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and is a [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] fellow (formally known as Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]])).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|url=http://www.csicop.org|publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Just Gjessing''' (Oslo, 13 July 1926 – 29 October 2005) was a Norwegian geographer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Just_Gjessing Just Gjessing], [[Store Norske Leksikon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gjessing obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with a study on Norway’s [[hydrology]] during [[deglaciation]]. One year later he was appointed full professor. In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation so that in the 1970s shifted the focus of his research into [[environmental impact assessment]]s. This meant leaving behind his work on pure [[fluvial geomorphology]] that had previously brought him acclaim. Following this interest he joined in 1967 the Oslo University’s Commission for Watercourse Regulation. In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation, of which he was a member until 1981. He co-authored various notable books including ''Beste Store Norge Atlas'' (1983) and the five volume work ''Norge'' (1984–1986) and the journal ''[[Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift]]'' from 1979 to 1987. In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]] where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Trondalen|author-first=Jon Martin |date=2006|title=Professor Just Gjessing: ‘A journey with a purpouse’ |journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]] |volume=60|issue=|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gjessing’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so-called “rejectionist” even within his own department at the [[University of Oslo]]. Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985, attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">'''Lamellar phase''' refers generally to packing of [[Chemical polarity|polar]]-headed long chain nonpolar-tail [[molecule]]s in an environment of bulk polar liquid, as sheets of bilayers separated by bulk liquid. In [[biophysics]], polar lipids (mostly, [[phospholipids]], and rarely, [[glycolipids]]) pack as a [[liquid crystal]]line [[bilayer]], with [[hydrophobic]] fatty [[acyl]] long chains directed inwardly and polar headgroups of [[lipid]]s aligned on the outside in contact with water, as a 2-dimensional flat sheet surface.  Under [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM), after staining with polar headgroup reactive chemical [[osmium tetroxide]], lamellar lipid phase appears as two thin parallel dark staining lines/sheets, constituted by aligned polar headgroups  of lipids. 'Sandwiched' between these two parallel lines, there exists one thicker line/sheet of non-staining closely packed layer of long lipid fatty acyl chains. This TEM-appearance became famous as Robertson's unit membrane - the basis of all [[biological membranes]], and structure of [[lipid bilayer]] in  [[unilamellar liposome]]s. In multilamellar [[liposomes]], many such lipid bilayer sheets are layered concentrically with water layers in between.

[[File:Lamellar phase lipids (original research work of Dr. R.C. YashRoy).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1 Multi-lamellar phase of aqueous lipid dispersions, each white lamella represents a [[lipid bilayer]] organization in [[liposome]] made by vortex-mixing of dried total lipid extract of spinach [[thylakoid]] membranes with distilled water. Phosphotungstic acid [[negative stain]]ed sample viewed with [[transmission electron microscopy]] technique.]]

In lamellar lipid bilayers, polar headgroups of lipids align together at the interface of water and hydrophobic [[fatty-acid]] [[acyl]] chains align parallel to one another 'hiding away' from water. The lipid head groups are somewhat more 'tightly' packed than relatively 'fluid' hydrocarbon fatty acyl long chains. The lamellar lipid bilayer organization, thus reveals a 'flexibility gradient' of increasing freedom of motions from near the head-groups towards the terminal fatty-acyl chain methyl groups. Existence of such a dynamic organization of lamellar phase in liposomes as well as biological membranes can be confirmed by [[spin label]] [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] and high resolution [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] studies of biological membranes and liposomes.&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R C (1990) Magnetic resonance studies of dynamic organisation of lipids in chloroplast membranes. ''Journal of Biosciences'', vol. 15 (No.4), pp. 281-288.https://www.academia.edu/7327415/YashRoy_R_C_1990_Magnetic_resonance_studies_of_dynamic_organisation_of_lipids_in_chloro-_plast_membranes._Journal_of_Biosciences._Vol._15_No._4_pp._281-288&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'soft matter science', where physics and chemistry meet biological science, a bilayer lamellar phase has been recently created from fluorinated silica, and it has been projected for use as a shear-thinning [[lubricant]].&lt;ref&gt;Pottage M J, Kasuma T, Grillo I, Gravey C J, Stickland A D and Tabor R F (2014) Fluorinated lamellar phases: Structural characterization and use as templates for highly ordered silica materials.

'''Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory''' ('''LBNL'''), commonly referred to as '''Berkeley Lab''', is a [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|United States national laboratory]] located in the [[Berkeley Hills]] near [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] that conducts scientific research on behalf of the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). It is managed and operated by the [[University of California]]. The laboratory overlooks the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s main campus.

==History==
The laboratory was founded in August 26, 1931 by [[Ernest Lawrence]] as the '''Radiation Laboratory''' of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] associated with the Physics Department. It centered physics research around his new instrument, the [[cyclotron]], a type of [[particle accelerator]] for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="chapter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fchp1.html |title=Lawrence and His Laboratory: Chapter 1: A New Lab for a New Science |publisher=Lbl.gov |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Lawrence pushed to create larger and larger machines for physics research, courting private [[philanthropy|philanthropists]] for funding. He was the first to develop a large team to build big projects to make discoveries in basic research.&lt;ref name="BigScience"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hiltzik |first=Michael |date= 2015 |title=Big Science |url=http://michaelhiltzik.com/big-science |publisher= Simon and Schuster  |isbn= 978-1-4516-7576-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually these machines grew too large to be held on the university grounds, and in 1940 the lab moved to its current site atop the hill above campus.&lt;ref name="chapter1" /&gt;

Part of the team put together during this period includes two other young scientists who went on to establish large laboratories; J. Robert Oppenheimer founded Los Alamos Laboratory, and Robert Wilson founded Fermilab.

[[Leslie Groves]] visited Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory in late 1942 as he was organizing the [[Manhattan Project]], meeting [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] for the first time. Oppenheimer was tasked with organizing the [[nuclear bomb]] development effort and founded today's [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to help keep the work secret.&lt;ref name="BigScience" /&gt;

At the RadLab, Lawrence and his colleagues developed the technique of  [[Isotope separation#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic enrichment]] of [[uranium]] using their experience with cyclotrons. The [[calutron]]s (named after the University) became the basic unit of the massive [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] facility in [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]].  Lawrence's lab helped contribute to what have been judged to be the three most valuable technology developments of the war (the atomic bomb, proximity fuse, and radar). The cyclotron, whose construction was stalled during the war, was finished in November 1946. The Manhattan Project shut down two months later.

After the war, the Radiation Laboratory became one of the first laboratories to be incorporated into the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) (now Department of Energy, DOE). The most highly classified work remained at Los Alamos, but the RadLab remained involved. [[Edward Teller]] suggested setting up a second lab similar to Los Alamos to compete with their designs. This led to the creation of an offshoot of the RadLab (now the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]) in 1952. Some of the RadLab's work was transferred to the new lab, but some classified research continued at Berkeley Lab until the 1970s, when it became a laboratory dedicated only to unclassified scientific research.

Shortly after the death of Lawrence in August 1958, the UC Radiation Laboratory (both branches) was renamed the '''Lawrence Radiation Laboratory'''. The Berkeley location became the '''Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory''' in 1971,&lt;ref name=apselsl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/history/historicsites/lawrencelivingston.cfm |publisher=American Physical Society |title=Ernest Lawrence and M. Stanley Livingston |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="universityofcalifornia.edu"&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/labs/ University of California {{pipe}} Office of the President] (accessed July 15, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; although many continued to call it the RadLab. Gradually, another shortened form came into common usage, "'''LBL'''". Its formal name was amended to Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1995, when "National" was added to the names of all DOE labs. "Ernest Orlando" was later dropped to shorten the name. Today, the lab is commonly referred to as "'''Berkeley Lab'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/early-years.html |title=Ernest Lawrence's Cyclotron |publisher=Lbl.gov |date=August 27, 1958 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alvarez Physics Memos are a set of informal [[working paper]]s of the large group of physicists, engineers, computer programmers, and technicians led by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis W. Alvarez]] from the early 1950s until his death in 1988. Over 1700 memos are available on-line, hosted by the Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alvarezphysicsmemos.lbl.gov|title=Alvarez Physics Memos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science mission==
From the 1950s through the present, Berkeley Lab has maintained its status as a major international center for physics research, and has also diversified its research program into almost every realm of scientific investigation. The Laboratory's 20 scientific divisions are organized within six areas of research: Computing Sciences, Physical Sciences, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Biosciences,  Energy Sciences, and Energy Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/research-areas |title=Research Areas at Berkeley Lab |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley Lab has six main science thrusts: advancing integrated fundamental energy science, integrative biological and environmental system science, advanced computing for science impact, discovering the fundamental properties of matter and energy, accelerators for the future, and developing energy technology innovations for a sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/lp/pdf/laboratory-planning-process/SC_Consolidated_Laboratory_Plans.pdf |title= The U.S. Department of Energy's Ten-Year-Plans for the Office of Science National Laboratories |publisher= U.S. Department of Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Lawrence's belief that scientific research is best done through teams of individuals with different fields of expertise, working together. His teamwork concept is a Berkeley Lab tradition that continues today.

Berkeley Lab operates five major National User Facilities for the DOE Office of Science: 
# The [[Advanced Light Source]] (ALS) is a synchrotron light source with 41 beam lines providing ultraviolet, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray light to scientific experiments. The ALS is one of the world's brightest sources of soft x-rays, which are used to characterize the electronic structure of matter and to reveal microscopic structures with elemental and chemical specificity. About 2,500 scientist-users carry out research at ALS every year. Berkeley Lab is proposing an upgrade of ALS which would increase the coherent flux of soft x-rays by two-three orders of magnitude. 
#The [[Joint Genome Institute]] (JGI) supports genomic research in support of the DOE missions in alternative energy, glocal carbon cycling, and environmental management.  The JGI's partner laboratories are Berkeley Lab, [[Lawrence Livermore National Lab]] (LLNL), [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL), and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology.  The JGI's central role is the development of a diversity of large-scale experimental and computational capabilities to link sequence to biological insights relevant to energy and environmental research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jgi.doe.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2016_January_JGI_Strategic_Planning_update.pdf |title = DOE Joint Genome Institute Strategic Planning Update |publisher = Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | accessdate=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,200 scientist-users take advantage of JGI's capabilities for their research every year.
# The [[Molecular Foundry]] is a multidisciplinary nanoscience research facility. Its seven research facilities focus on Imaging and Manipulation of Nanostructures, Nanofabrication, Theory of Nanostructured Materials, Inorganic Nanostructures, Biological Nanostructures, Organic and Macromolecular Synthesis, and Electron Microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundry.lbl.gov/facilities/index.html |title=Facilities at the Molecular Foundry |publisher = Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 700 scientist-users make use of these facilities in their research every year.

Berkeley Lab is the lead partner in the [[Joint BioEnergy Institute]] (JBEI), located in [[Emeryville, California]]. Other partners are the [[Sandia National Laboratories]], the University of California (UC) campuses of Berkeley and Davis, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]], and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). JBEI's primary scientific mission is to advance the development of the next generation of [[biofuels]] – liquid fuels derived from the solar energy stored in plant biomass. JBEI is one of three new U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Research Centers (BRCs).

Berkeley Lab has a major role in two DOE Energy Innovation Hubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/bes/research/doe-energy-innovation-hubs |title=DOE Energy Innovation Hubs |publisher= Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission of the [[Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis]] (JCAP) is to find a cost-effective method to produce fuels using only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The lead institution for JCAP is the [[California Institute of Technology]] and Berkeley Lab is the second institutional center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://solarfuelshub.org/ |title= Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) is to create next-generation battery technologies that will transform transportation and the electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jcesr.org/about/mission |title= Joint Center for Energy Storage Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonne National Laboratory]] leads JCESR and Berkeley Lab is a major partner.

==Operations and governance==
The University of California operates Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under a contract with the Department of Energy. The site consists of 76 buildings (owned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]) located on {{convert|200|acre|km2}} owned by the university in the Berkeley Hills. Altogether, the Lab has some 4,000 UC employees, of whom about 800 are students or postdocs, and each year it hosts more than 3,000 participating guest scientists. There are approximately two dozen DOE employees stationed at the laboratory to provide federal oversight of Berkeley Lab's work for the DOE. The laboratory director, Michael Witherell, is appointed by the [[Regents of the University of California|university regents]] and reports to the university president.  Although Berkeley Lab is governed by UC independently of the Berkeley campus, the two entities are closely interconnected: more than 200 Berkeley Lab researchers hold joint appointments as UC Berkeley faculty.

The Lab's budget for fiscal year 2018 was $1.1 billion.

==Scientific achievements, inventions, and discoveries==
Notable scientific accomplishments at the Lab since World War II include the observation of the [[antiproton]], the discovery of several [[transuranic]] [[Chemical element|elements]], and the discovery of the [[accelerating universe]].

Since its inception, 12 researchers associated with Berkeley Lab ([[Ernest Lawrence]], [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Edwin M. McMillan]], [[Owen Chamberlain]], [[Emilio G. Segrè]], [[Donald A. Glaser]], [[Melvin Calvin]], [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis W. Alvarez]], [[Yuan T. Lee]], [[Steven Chu]], [[George F. Smoot]] and [[Saul Perlmutter]])  have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the Lab|url = http://www.lbl.gov/about/|website = www.lbl.gov|access-date = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy Berkeley Lab scientists are members of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), one of the highest honors for a scientist in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thirteen Berkeley Lab scientists have won the [[National Medal of Science]], the nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in fields of scientific research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eighteen Berkeley Lab engineers have been elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and three Berkeley Lab scientists have been elected into the [[National Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elements discovered by Berkeley Lab physicists include [[astatine]], [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[curium]], [[americium]], [[berkelium]]*, [[californium]]*, [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]], [[lawrencium]]*, [[dubnium]], and [[seaborgium]]*. Those elements listed with asterisks (*) are named after the University Professors Lawrence and Seaborg. Seaborg was the principal scientist involved in their discovery. The element [[technetium]] was discovered after Ernest Lawrence gave Emilio Segrè a [[molybdenum]] strip from the Berkeley Lab cyclotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/new-elements-here.html |title=Chemical Elements Discovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |publisher=Lbl.gov |date=June 7, 1999 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabricated evidence used to claim the creation of [[oganesson]] and [[livermorium]] by [[Victor Ninov]], a researcher employed at Berkeley Lab, led to the retraction of two articles.&lt;ref name=nature2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalton|first=Rex|title=The stars who fell to Earth|journal=Nature|year=2002|volume=420|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6917/pdf/420728a.pdf|accessdate=April 21, 2012|doi=10.1038/420728a|pmid=12490902|pages=728–9|bibcode=2002Natur.420..728D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inventions and discoveries to come out of Berkeley Lab include: "smart" windows with embedded electrodes that enable window glass to respond to changes in sunlight, synthetic genes for antimalaria and anti-AIDS superdrugs based on breakthroughs in [[synthetic biology]], [[electronic ballasts]] for more efficient lighting, [[Home Energy Saver]], the web's first do-it-yourself home energy audit tool, a pocket-sized DNA sampler called the PhyloChip, and the Berkeley Darfur Stove, which uses one-quarter as much firewood as traditional [[cook stoves]]. One of Berkeley Lab's most notable breakthroughs is the discovery of [[dark energy]]. During the 1980s and 1990s Berkeley Lab physicists and astronomers formed the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] (SCP), using Type Ia supernovae as "standard candles" to measure the expansion rate of the universe. Their successful methods inspired competition, with the result that early in 1998 both the SCP and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]] announced the surprising discovery that expansion is accelerating; the cause was soon named dark energy.

[[Arthur Rosenfeld]], a senior scientist at Berkeley Lab, was the nation's leading advocate for energy efficiency from 1975 until his death in 2017. He led efforts at the Lab that produced several  technologies that radically improved efficiency:  compact fluorescent lamps, low-energy refrigerators, and windows that trap heat. He established the Center for Building Science at the Lab, which developed into the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division. He developed the first energy-efficiency standards for buildings and appliances in  California, which helped the state to sustain constant electricity use per capita, a phenomenon called the [[Rosenfeld effect]]. The Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impacts Division continues to set the research foundation for the national energy efficiency standards and works with China, India, and other countries to help develop their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eaei.lbl.gov/ |title=Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impacts Division |publisher=LBL.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12653">'''Mangrove restoration''' is the regeneration of [[mangrove forest]] ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of [[restoration ecology]], which aims to “[assist] the recovery of [[ecological resilience|resilience]] and [[adaptive capacity]] of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSM 2000 – National Forest Resource Management, Chapter 2020 – Ecological Restoration and Resilience|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/restoration/|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[environmental impact]]s are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.

==Environmental context==
Mangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of [[biodiversity]] and provide humanity with valuable [[ecosystem services]]. They are used by [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[migratory bird]]s as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for [[fish]] and [[crustacean]] species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect [[riparian zone]]s by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of [[sediment]]-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially [[toxic waste]] products and improving the [[water quality|quality of water]] and sanitation in coastal communities.

To the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and [[timber]], as well as non-timber forest products such as [[medicinal plant]]s, palm leaves and [[honey]]. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-[[canopy (biology)|canopy]] terrestrial [[rainforest]]s, which means that they may play a role in [[climate change mitigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spalding|first=Mark|title=World Atlas of Mangroves|year=2010|publisher=Earthscan|location=London, UK: Washington, DC |author2=Kainuma, Mami |author3=Collins, Lorna}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]] associated with climate change.&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Wetlands and Water Synthesis.|url=http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.358.aspx.pdf|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=10 July 2012|location=Washington, DC|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. 19.3.3.5, "Mangrove Ecosystems"|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg2/index.php?idp=0|work=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2001|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of [[flooding]], [[shoreline erosion]], [[saline intrusion]] and increased storm activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=C.D.|title=Impact of expected climate change on mangroves|journal=Hydrobiologia|year=1995|volume=295|issue=1-3|pages=75–81|doi=10.1007/BF00029113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mangrove loss and degradation===
The issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are [[deforestation|being lost]] very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duke|first=N.C. |author2=Meynecke, J.-O. |author3=Dittmann, S. |author4=Ellison, A.M. |author5=Anger, K. |author6=Berger, U. |author7=Cannicci, S. |author8=Diele, K. |author9=Ewel, K.C. |author10=Field, C.D. |author11=Koedam, N. |author12=Lee, S.Y. |author13=Marchand, C. |author14=Nordhaus, I. |author15=Dahdouh-Guebas, F. |title=A world without mangroves?|journal=Science|year=2007|volume=317|issue=5834|pages=41–42|doi=10.1126/science.317.5834.41b}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – down from 188,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1980.&lt;ref name="Food and Agriculture Organization"&gt;{{cite book|title=The world's mangroves 1980-2005|year=2007|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|isbn=9789251058565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, some 36,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or nearly 20% of the world's mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area.&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute" /&gt; Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, [[housing]] and [[tourism]] development; for [[aquaculture]], primarily shrimp farms; and for [[agriculture]], such as [[rice paddies]], [[livestock]] [[pasture]] and [[salt production]].&lt;ref name="Food and Agriculture Organization" /&gt; Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and [[drainage]] canals across [[tidal flat]]s.

===Mangrove restoration===
Mangroves are [[Resistance (ecology)|sensitive ecosystems]], changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level &lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting single-species stands of mangroves in areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecological Mangrove Restoration in Thailand|url=http://www.wetlands.org/Whatwedo/Ouractions/tabid/2661/mod/601/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2018/Ecological-Mangrove-Restoration-in-Thailand.aspx|publisher=Wetlands International|year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010203029/http://www.wetlands.org/Whatwedo/Ouractions/tabid/2661/mod/601/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2018/Ecological-Mangrove-Restoration-in-Thailand.aspx|archivedate=2012-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and [[hydrological]] requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=C.D.|title=Rehabilitation of Mangrove Ecosystems: An Overview|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|year=1998|volume=37|issue=8-12|pages=383–392|doi=10.1016/s0025-326x(99)00106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of [[secondary succession]], without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of [[seedling]]s.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Roy R.|title=Ecological engineering for successful management and restoration of mangrove forests|journal=Ecological Engineering|year=2005|volume=24|pages=403–418|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.
One example of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method &lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: 
# Assess the ecology, especially reproduction and distribution patterns, of the mangrove species at the disturbed site; 
# Map the topographical elevations and hydrological patterns that determine how seedlings should establish themselves at the site; 
# Assess the changes made to the site that currently prevent the site from recovering by itself; 
# Design a restoration plan that begins by restoring the normal range of elevations and tidal hydrology at the site; and 
# Monitor the site to determine if the restoration has been successful in light of the original objectives. 
The actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases;&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective.

==Additional considerations==
An important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and [[local knowledge]], as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.

===Limitations===
In some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the [[soil degradation|degradation of the soil]] that regularly follows the [[clear-cutting]] of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced [[soil erosion|erosion]] of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of [[salinity]], and/or buildup of toxins.&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt; However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may become unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its [[soil quality|quality]]. Using foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, it is difficult for them to recover without a scientific intervention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9050">'''Mechanics of gelation''' describes processes relevant to [[sol-gel process]].

In a static sense, the fundamental difference between a liquid and a solid is that the solid has elastic resistance against a shearing stress while a liquid does not. Thus, a simple liquid will not typically support a transverse acoustic [[phonon]], or [[shear wave]]. Gels have been described by Born as liquids in which an elastic resistance against shearing survives, yielding both viscous and elastic properties. It has been shown theoretically that in a certain low-frequency range, polymeric gels should propagate shear waves with relatively low damping. The distinction between a sol (solution) and a gel therefore appears to be understood in a manner analogous to the practical distinction between the elastic and plastic deformation ranges of a metal. The distinction lies in the ability to respond to an applied shear force via macroscopic viscous flow.&lt;ref&gt;Born, M., ''The Stability of Crystal Lattices'', J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 7, p. 591 9(1939); Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., Vol. 36, p. 160 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Gennes, P. G. and Pincus, P., J. de Chim. Phys., Vol. 64, p. 616 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dynamic sense, the response of a gel to an alternating force (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body to respond to a mechanical force by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Philippoff, W. in ''Physical Acoustics'', Ed. W. P. Mason, Vol. 28 (Academic Press, NY 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, E. A. and Reed, G. E., J. Phys. Chem., Vol. 40, p. 1161 (1936), Vol. 41, p. 911 (1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural relaxation===
The structural relaxation of a [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] gel has been identified as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels.&lt;ref name="CJ"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. J. |last=Brinker |author2=G. W. Scherer |title=Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing |publisher=Academic Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-12-134970-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made,&lt;ref&gt;Walter, A. T., J. Polymer Sci., Vol. 13, p. 207 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves,&lt;ref&gt;Ferry, J. D., ''et al.'', Rev. Sci Instr., Vol. 112, p. 79 (1941); J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 64, p. 1323 (1942); Vol. 70, p. 2244 (1948); J. Coll. Sci., Vol. 9, p. 224 (1953); J. Polymer Sci., Vol. 5, p. 195 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beltman, H., and Lyklema, J., Farad. Disc. Chem. Soc., Vol. 57, p. 92 9(1974).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gettings, W. J., ''et al.'', J. Chem. Soc., Farad, Trans. II, Vol. 74, p. 1246 (1978), Vol. 78, p. 1661 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, A. M. and Geissler, E., J. de Phys., Vol. 39, p. 631 (1978); Macromolecules, Vol. 13, p. 1276 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; which yields the dynamic [[modulus of rigidity]]. [[Dynamic light scattering]] (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the [[autocorrelation function]] near the point of gelation.

===Phase transition===
Tanaka ''et al''., emphasize that the discrete and reversible volume transitions which occur in partially hydrolyzed acrylimide gels can be interpreted in terms of a [[phase transition]] of the system consisting of the charged [[polymer]] network, hydrogen (counter)ions and liquid matrix. The phase transition is a manifestation of competition among the three forces which contribute to the [[osmotic pressure]] in the gel:
# The positive osmotic pressure of (+) [[hydrogen ion]]s
# The negative pressure due to polymer-polymer affinity
# The rubber-like [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the polymer network
The balance of these forces varies with change in temperature or [[solvent]] properties. The total [[osmotic pressure]] acting on the system is the sum osmotic pressure of the gel. It is further shown that the phase transition can be induced by the application of an [[electric field]] across the gel. The volume change at the transition point is either discrete (as in a first-order [[Ehrenfest]] transition) or continuous (second order Ehrenfest analogy), depending on the degree of ionization of the gel and on the solvent composition.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., Phys. Rev., Vol. A17, p. 763 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., Sci. Amer., Vol. 244, p. 124 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., Hocker, L. O. and Benedek, G. B., J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 59, p. 5151 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., ''et al.'', PRL, Vol. 38, p.722 (1977); Vol. 40, p. 820 (1978); Vol. 42, p. 23 (1979); Vol. 45, p. 1936 (1980); Science, Vol. 218, p.467 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elastic continuum===
The gel is thus interpreted as an elastic continuum, which deforms when subjected to externally applied shear forces, but is incompressible upon application of hydrostatic pressure. This combination of fluidity and rigidity is explained in terms of the gel structure: that of a liquid contained within a fibrous polymer network or matrix by the extremely large friction between the liquid and the fiber or polymer network. Thermal fluctuations may produce infinitesimal expansion or contraction within the network, and the evolution of such fluctuations will ultimately determine the molecular morphology and the degree of hydration of the body.

Quasi-elastic light scattering offers direct experimental access to measurement of the wavelength and lifetimes of critical fluctuations, which are governed by the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the gel. It is reasonable to expect a relationship between the [[amplitude]] of such fluctuations and the [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] (reversible) or [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the [[scattered radiation|scattered]] light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the [[compressibility]] becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the polymer network offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.

===Ultimate microstructure===
The rate of [[relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] of density fluctuations will be rapid if the restoring force, which depends upon the network elasticity, is large—and if the friction between the network and the interstitial fluid is small. The theory suggests that the rate is directly proportional to the elasticity and inversely proportional to the frictional force. The friction in turn depends upon both the viscosity of the fluid and the average size of the pores contained within the polymer network.

Thus, if the elasticity is inferred from the measurements of the scattering intensity, and the viscosity is determined independently (via mechanical methods such as ultrasonic attenuation) measurement of the relaxation rate yields information on the pore size distribution contained within the polymer network, e.g. large fluctuations in polymer density near the critical point yield large density differentials with a corresponding bimodal distribution of porosity. The difference in average size between the smaller pores (in the highly dense regions) and the larger pores (in regions of lower average density) will therefore depend upon the degree of phase separation which is allowed to occur before such fluctuations become thermally arrested or "frozen in" at or near the critical point of the transition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">'''Methodical culturalism''' is a philosophical approach developed by [[Peter Janich]] and his pupils. The core statement of this approach is that [[science]] is not developed from purely theoretical considerations, but as a development of  everyday, [[proto-scientific]] human behavior. That is to say, science is a stylized form of everyday knowledge-forming practice.

Thus, from the viewpoint of methodical culturalism, science is understood as a continuation of the practical processes of the everyday world and must be analyzed from this aspect systematically and methodically.

Methodical culturalism is a development of the [[methodical constructivism]] of the [[Erlanger school]] (known as "[[Erlanger constructivism]]").

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:DrawingHands.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Drawing Hands]]", a drawing by [[M. C. Escher]]]] --&gt;In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], '''mutual recursion''' is a form of [[recursion]] where two mathematical or computational objects, such as functions or data types, are defined in terms of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Rubio-Sánchez, Jaime Urquiza-Fuentes,Cristóbal Pareja-Flores (2002), 'A Gentle Introduction to Mutual Recursion', Proceedings of the 13th annual conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education, June 30–July 2, 2008, Madrid, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual recursion is very common in [[functional programming]] and in some problem domains, such as [[recursive descent parser]]s, where the data types are naturally mutually recursive.

==Examples==

===Data types===
{{further|Recursive data type}}
The most important basic example of a data type that can be defined by mutual recursion is a [[tree (data structure)|tree]], which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:
 f: &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 t: v f
A forest ''f'' consists of a list of trees, while a tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a forest ''f'' (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and another thing with the children.

This mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:
 t: v &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
A tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list of another, which require disentangling to prove results about.

In [[Standard ML]], the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:{{sfn|Harper|2000|loc="[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/introsml/core/datatypes.htm Date Types]"}}
&lt;source lang=ocaml&gt;
datatype 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a forest
and      'a forest = Nil | Cons of 'a tree * 'a forest
&lt;/source&gt;

===Computer functions===
Just as algorithms on recursive data types can naturally be given by recursive functions, algorithms on mutually recursive data structures can be naturally given by mutually recursive functions. Common examples include algorithms on trees, and [[recursive descent parser]]s. As with direct recursion, [[tail call optimization]] is necessary if the recursion depth is large or unbounded, such as using mutual recursion for multitasking. Note that tail call optimization in general (when the function called is not the same as the original function, as in tail-recursive calls) may be more difficult to implement than the special case of tail-recursive call optimization, and thus efficient implementation of mutual tail recursion may be absent from languages that only optimize tail-recursive calls. In languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] that require declaration before use, mutually recursive functions require [[forward declaration]], as a forward reference cannot be avoided when defining them.

As with directly recursive functions, a [[Recursion (computer science)#Wrapper function|wrapper function]] may be useful, with the mutually recursive functions defined as [[nested function]]s within its scope if this is supported. This is particularly useful for sharing state across a set of functions without having to pass parameters between them.

====Basic examples====
A standard example of mutual recursion, which is admittedly artificial, determines whether a non-negative number is even or odd by defining two separate functions that call each other, decrementing each time.{{sfn|Hutton|2007|loc=6.5 Mutual recursion, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=olp7lAtpRX0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22mutual+recursion%22 53–55]}} In C:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
bool is_even(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return true;
    else
        return is_odd(n - 1);
}

bool is_odd(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return false;
    else
        return is_even(n - 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

These functions are based on the observation that the question ''is 4 even?'' is equivalent to ''is 3 odd?'', which is in turn equivalent to ''is 2 even?'', and so on down to 0. This example is mutual [[single recursion]], and could easily be replaced by iteration. In this example, the mutually recursive calls are [[tail call]]s, and tail call optimization would be necessary to execute in constant stack space. In C, this would take ''O''(''n'') stack space, unless rewritten to use jumps instead of calls.
&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/DOCUMENT/TUTORIALATS/HTML/c244.html Mutual Tail-Recursion]" and "[http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/TUTORIAL/contents/tail-recursive-functions.html Tail-Recursive Functions]", ''[http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/DOCUMENT/TUTORIALATS/HTML/book1.html A Tutorial on Programming Features in ATS],'' Hongwei Xi, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This could be reduced to a single recursive function &lt;code&gt;is_even&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, &lt;code&gt;is_odd&lt;/code&gt;, which could be inlined, would call &lt;code&gt;is_even&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;is_even&lt;/code&gt; would only call itself.

As a more general class of examples, an algorithm on a tree can be decomposed into its behavior on a value and its behavior on children, and can be split up into two mutually recursive functions, one specifying the behavior on a tree, calling the forest function for the forest of children, and one specifying the behavior on a forest, calling the tree function for the tree in the forest.  In Python:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
 def f_tree(tree):
     f_value(tree.value)
     f_forest(tree.children)

 def f_forest(forest):
     for tree in forest:
         f_tree(tree)
&lt;/source&gt;
In this case the tree function calls the forest function by single recursion, but the forest function calls the tree function by [[multiple recursion]].

Using the [[Standard ML]] data type above, the size of a tree (number of nodes) can be computed via the following mutually recursive functions:{{sfn|Harper|2000|loc="[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/introsml/core/datatypes.htm Datatypes]"}}
&lt;source lang=ocaml&gt;
fun size_tree Empty = 0
  | size_tree (Node (_, f)) = 1 + size_forest f
and size_forest Nil = 0
  | size_forest (Cons (t, f')) = size_tree t + size_forest f'
&lt;/source&gt;

A more detailed example in Scheme, counting the leaves of a tree:{{sfn|Harvey|Wright|1999|loc=V. Abstraction: 18. Trees: Mutual Recursion, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=igJRhp0KGn8C&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22mutual%20recursion%22 310–313]}}
&lt;source lang=scheme&gt;
(define (count-leaves tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      1
      (count-leaves-in-forest (children tree))))

(define (count-leaves-in-forest forest)
  (if (null? forest)
      0
      (+ (count-leaves (car forest))
         (count-leaves-in-forest (cdr forest)))))
&lt;/source&gt;

These examples reduce easily to a single recursive function by inlining the forest function in the tree function, which is commonly done in practice: directly recursive functions that operate on trees sequentially process the value of the node and recurse on the children within one function, rather than dividing these into two separate functions.

====Advanced examples====
A more complicated example is given by [[recursive descent parser]]s, which can be naturally implemented by having one function for each [[Production (computer science)|production rule]] of a grammar, which then mutually recurse; this will in general be multiple recursion, as production rules generally combine multiple parts. This can also be done without mutual recursion, for example by still having separate functions for each production rule, but having them called by a single controller function, or by putting all the grammar in a single function.

Mutual recursion can also implement a [[finite-state machine]], with one function for each state, and single recursion in changing state; this requires tail call optimization if the number of state changes is large or unbounded. This can be used as a simple form of [[cooperative multitasking]]. A similar approach to multitasking is to instead use [[coroutine]]s which call each other, where rather than terminating by calling another routine, one coroutine yields to another but does not terminate, and then resumes execution when it is yielded back to. This allows individual coroutines to hold state, without it needing to be passed by parameters or stored in shared variables.

There are also some algorithms which naturally have two phases, such as [[minimax]] (min and max), and these can be implemented by having each phase in a separate function with mutual recursion, though they can also be combined into a single function with direct recursion.

===Mathematical functions===
In mathematics, the [[Hofstadter Female and Male sequences]] are an example of a pair of integer sequences defined in a mutually recursive manner.

Fractals can be computed (up to a given resolution) by recursive functions. This can sometimes be done more elegantly via mutually recursive functions; the [[Sierpiński curve]] is a good example.

==Prevalence==
Mutual recursion is very common in the [[functional programming]] style, and is often used for programs written in [[Lisp programming language|LISP]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[ML programming language|ML]], and similar [[programming language|languages]]. In languages such as [[Prolog programming language|Prolog]], mutual recursion is almost unavoidable.

Some programming styles discourage mutual recursion, claiming that it can be confusing to distinguish the conditions which will return an answer from the conditions that would allow the code to run forever without producing an answer. [[Peter Norvig]] points to a [[design pattern]] which discourages the use entirely, stating:&lt;ref&gt;[http://norvig.com/sudoku.html Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=If you have two mutually-recursive functions that both alter the state of an object, try to move almost all the functionality into just one of the functions. Otherwise you will probably end up duplicating code.}}

==Terminology==
Mutual recursion is also known as [[indirect recursion]], by contrast with [[direct recursion]], where a single function calls itself directly. This is simply a difference of emphasis, not a different notion: "indirect recursion" emphasises an individual function, while "mutual recursion" emphasises the set of functions, and does not single out an individual function. For example, if ''f'' calls itself, that is direct recursion. If instead ''f'' calls ''g'' and then ''g'' calls ''f,'' which in turn calls ''g'' again, from the point of view of ''f'' alone, ''f'' is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of ''g'' alone, ''g'' is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of both, ''f'' and ''g'' are mutually recursing on each other. Similarly a set of three or more functions that call each other can be called a set of mutually recursive functions.

== Conversion to direct recursion ==

Mathematically, a set of mutually recursive functions are [[primitive recursive]], which can be proven by [[course-of-values recursion]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://planetmath.org/mutualrecursion mutual recursion]", ''PlanetMath''&lt;/ref&gt; building a single function ''F'' that lists the values of the individual recursive function in order: &lt;math&gt;F = f_1(0), f_2(0), f_1(1), f_2(1), \dots,&lt;/math&gt; and rewriting the mutual recursion as a primitive recursion.

Any mutual recursion between two procedures can be converted to direct recursion by inlining the code of one procedure into the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/180000/176510/p151-kaser.pdf?key1=176510&amp;key2=1857140721&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=82873082&amp;CFTOKEN=54657523 On the Conversion of Indirect to Direct Recursion] by Owen Kaser, C. R. Ramakrishnan, and Shaunak Pawagi at [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; If there is only one site where one procedure calls the other, this is straightforward, though if there are several it can involve code duplication. In terms of the call stack, two mutually recursive procedures yield a stack ABABAB..., and inlining B into A yields the direct recursion (AB)(AB)(AB)...

Alternately, any number of procedures can be merged into a single procedure that takes as argument a [[variant record]] (or [[algebraic data type]]) representing the selection of a procedure and its arguments; the merged procedure then dispatches on its argument to execute the corresponding code and uses direct recursion to call self as appropriate.  This can be seen as a limited application of [[defunctionalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This translation may be useful when any of the mutually recursive procedures can be called by outside code, so there is no obvious case for inlining one procedure into the other. Such code then needs to be modified so that procedure calls are performed by bundling arguments into a variant record as described; alternately, wrapper procedures may be used for this task.

'''Nanoengineering''' is the practice of [[engineering]] on the [[nanoscale]]. It derives its name from the [[nanometre]], a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter.

Nanoengineering is largely a synonym for [[nanotechnology]], but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field.

==Degree programs==

The first nanoengineering program  was started at the [[University of Toronto]] within the Engineering Science program as one of the options of study in the final years. In 2003, the [[Lund Institute of Technology]] started a program in Nanoengineering. In 2004, the [[College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering]] at [[SUNY Polytechnic Institute]] was established on the campus of the [[University at Albany]]. In 2005, the [[University of Waterloo]] established a unique program which offers a full degree in Nanotechnology Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisiana Tech University]] started the first program in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006 the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] started a Bachelor and a Master program NanoEngineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.uni-due.de/nanoengineering/| title = NanoEngineering at University of Duisburg-Essen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike early NanoEngineering programs, the first Nanoengineering Department in the world, offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees, was established by the  [[University of California, San Diego]] in 2007.
In 2009, the [[University of Toronto]] began offering all Options of study in Engineering Science as degrees, bringing the second nanoengineering degree to Canada. Rice University  established in 2016 a Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering (MSNE).
DTU Nanotech - the Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology - is a department at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] established in 1990.

In 2013, [[Wayne State University]] began offering a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Certificate Program, which is funded by a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Education (NUE) grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]. The primary goal is to offer specialized undergraduate training in nanotechnology. Other goals are: 1) to teach emerging technologies at the undergraduate level, 2) to train a new adaptive workforce, and 3) to retrain working engineers and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.wayne.edu/nano/about.php/|title=Wayne State University Nanoengineering Certificate Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

* [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) - Can be used to both image, and to manipulate structures as small as a single atom.
* [[Molecular self-assembly]] - Arbitrary sequences of [[DNA]] can now be synthesized cheaply in bulk, and used to create custom proteins or regular patterns of amino acids. Similarly, DNA strands can bind to other DNA strands, allowing simple structures to be created.

:''The following [[Portal:Contents/Outlines|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to law:
'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.
** [[Halakha]], in Judaism
** [[Hindu law]]
** [[Jain law]]
** [[Patimokkha]], in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]
** [[Sharia]], in [[Islam]]

'''''Pars pro toto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɑːr|z|_|p|r|əʊ|_|ˈ|t|əʊ|t|əʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pars_pro_toto|title=pars pro toto {{!}} Definition of pars pro toto in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈpars proː ˈtoː.toː|lang}}), [[Latin]] for "a part (taken) for the whole",&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pars%20pro%20toto |title=pars pro toto - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[figure of speech]] where the name of a ''portion'' of an object, place, or concept represents its ''entirety''. It is distinct from a [[merism]], which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; [[metonymy]], where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object, place, or concept; or [[synecdoche]], which can refer both to this and its inverse: the whole representing a part.

In the context of language, ''pars pro toto'' means that something is named after a part of it, or after a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole.  For example, "glasses" is a ''pars pro toto'' name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass.
Examples of common ''pars pro toto'' usage in political geography include "[[Russia]]" or "[[Russian people|Russians]]", for the entire former [[Russian Empire]] or former [[Soviet Union]] or its people, [[China]] for [[People's Republic of China]], [[Holland]] for the [[Netherlands]], and, particularly in languages other than English, using the translation of "[[England]]" in that language for "[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]". Among English-speakers "[[Great Britain]]" or "Britain" is a common ''pars pro toto'' shorthand for the entire United Kingdom. [[Switzerland]]'s name (in German ''Schweiz'') comes from its central Canton of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]].

The inverse of a ''pars pro toto'' is a ''[[totum pro parte]]'', in which the whole is used to describe a part, such as widespread use of "[[Americas|America]]" (which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically, with alliteration, alongside Asia, Africa, "Europa", and ultimately [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]) in place of "[[United States of America]]", "United States" or "US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blair Arts Ltd. |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/totum_pro_parte.html |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology (ODLT) s.v. totum pro parte |publisher=ODLT |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[synecdoche]]'' is used for both, as well as similar metaphors, though in Greek it literally means "simultaneous understanding".

==Leagacy in exposure science==
Lioy’s reputation evolved primarily based upon his role in developing scientific principles and refining the approaches that define the field of exposure science. This discipline is associated with the field of environmental and occupational health sciences, which includes epidemiology and risk assessment, and prevention. In a 1990 article published in Environmental Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 1990 | title = The analysis of total human exposure for exposure assessment: a multi-discipline science for examining human contact with contaminants | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 938–945 | doi=10.1021/es00077a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first to properly locate exposure science as the bridge between traditional environmental sciences and the understanding of human health outcomes.  Building upon the work of occupational hygiene and the work of Wayne Ott,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ott | first1 = WR | year = 1995 | title = Human exposure assessment: the birth of a new science | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 449–472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lioy has clearly shown that the most important aspect of total human exposure is whether or not an individual comes into contact with a toxin, discussed in a 2010 review article on exposure science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 2010 | title = Exposure Science: A View of the Past and Major Milestones for the Future | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 118 | issue = 8| pages = 1081–1090 | doi=10.1289/ehp.0901634 | pmid=20308034 | pmc=2920079}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his recent{{when|date=July 2017}} book on exposure science.&lt;ref&gt;Lioy PJ, Weisel C. 2014. Exposure Science: Basic Principles and Applications. Oxford, UK: Academic Press, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter he has clearly linked external and internal markers of exposure.  Thus, prevention is a key part of the application of this field of science. He re-analyzed the work of the "father of occupational medicine", [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] who provided the initial reasons for examining contact with an agent to define ways to control occupational illness. This historical analysis can be used to improve the way exposure science evolves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 2007 | title = Bernardino Ramazzini: thoughts on his Treatise and linking exposure science and environmental/occupational medicine for prevention or intervention within environmental health | url = | journal = European Journal of Oncology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 69–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy is also a Fellow of the Collegium Ramazzini.

Lioy has been a central figure in understanding exposure to the air pollutant [[tropospheric ozone]], [[chloroform]] and other toxicant exposures from shower water, [[hexavalent chromium]] wastes, and most recently, the exposures derived from the dust and smoke released in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Lioy PJ 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Pellizzari | first2 = E | last3 = Prezant | first3 = D | year = 2006 | title = The World Trade Center Aftermath and Its Effects on Health: Understanding and Learning Through Human-Exposure Science | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 40 | issue = 22| pages = 6876–6885 | doi=10.1021/es062980e}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been a major figure in defining some of the basic data requirements (and providing exposure indices) for examining human exposures within the [[National Children's Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Isukapalli | first2 = S | last3 = Trasande | first3 = L | last4 = Thorpe | first4 = L | last5 = Dellarco | first5 = M | last6 = Weisel | first6 = C | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Using national and local extant data to characterize environmental exposures in the National Children's Study (NCS): Queens County, New York | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 117 | issue = 10| pages = 1494–1504 | doi=10.1289/ehp.0900623 | pmid=20019897 | pmc=2790501}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Co-Principal Investigator within the portion of the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS) conducted in five mid-western states, led by Edo Pellizzari of [[Research Triangle Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pellizzari | first1 = E | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Quackenboss | first3 = J | last4 = Whitmore | first4 = R | last5 = Clayton | first5 = A | last6 = Freeman | first6 = N | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 1995 | title = The design and implementation of phase I national human exposure assessment study in EPA Region V | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 327–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently his research addresses human exposure to engineered nanotechnology consumer products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Nazarenko | first2 = Y. | last3 = Han | first3 = T.W. | last4 = Lioy | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Mainelis | first5 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Nanotechnology and Exposure Science What Is Needed To Fill the Research and Data Gaps for Consumer Products | url = | journal = International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 378–387 | doi=10.1179/oeh.2010.16.4.378| pmid = 21222382 | pmc = 4011082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nazarenko | first1 = Y. | last2 = Han | first2 = T.W. | last3 = Lioy | first3 = P.J. | last4 = Mainelis | first4 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Potential for exposure to engineered nanoparticles from nanotechnology-based consumer spray products | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 515–528 | doi=10.1038/jes.2011.10 | pmid=21364702 | pmc=4027967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nazarenko | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lioy | first2 = P.J. | last3 = Mainelis | first3 = G. | year = 2014 | title = Quantitative assessment of inhalation exposure and deposited dose of aerosol from nanotechnology-based consumer sprays | journal = Environmental Science: Nano | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 161–171 | doi = 10.1039/c3en00053b | pmid=25621175 | pmc=4303255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the exposure of athletes to artificial turf used on athletic fields. In addition,  from 1987 to 1991 he was the Chairman of the First [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) Committee that directly addressed human exposure issues and published Human Exposure to Air Pollutants: Advances and Opportunities," also called "White Book.&lt;ref&gt;NRC. 1991. Human exposure assessment for airborne pollutants:  advances and opportunities. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;" He was Vice Chair of the NRC committee on Exposure Science that produced the report entitled "Exposure Science in the 21st Century:  A Vision and A Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;NRC. 2012. Exposure Science in the 21st Century:  A Vision and A Strategy. National Research Council. Washington, DC. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13507&lt;/ref&gt; He was also vice chair of the WTC Technical Panel that was formed to address the issues of residential cleanup during the WTC Aftermath.

===Ozone===
During the early 1980s Lioy recognized that the public health metric for defining exposure of the general population to troposphere [[ozone]] (smog) was incorrect and that the one-hour standard for peak ozone levels should be replaced by an eight-hour standard. Independently, Peter Rombout, [[RIVM]], Netherlands, discovered the same issue. In 1986, they collaborated and published an article on the need for an eight-hour ozone standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rombout | first1 = P | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = BD | year = 1986 | title = Rationale for an eight hour ozone standard | url = | journal = Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association | volume = 36 | issue = 8| pages = 913–916 | doi=10.1080/00022470.1986.10466130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy's group also conducted research on the relationship between ozone exposure and visits to emergency rooms during the summertime. In 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published an eight-hour [[NAAQS]] ozone standard based upon the scientific exposure–response evidence from multiple laboratories that exposures to asthmatics and others to eight hours of ozone above 0.80 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, 68 FR 32802, June 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  This standard for protection of public health was tightened to 0.75 ppm but remains as an 8-hour contact with the air pollutant, and is in final review for a further tightening of the 8-hour standard.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, 73 FR 16436, March 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semivolatile chemical exposures in the home===
In the 1990s Lioy’s laboratory became increasingly focused on dust in the home as a potential metric of exposure to metals and organic compounds. Included was the concurrent scientific issue of the semi-volatility of the materials associated with dust particles. This led to studies that demonstrated that semi-volatile pesticides should not just be considered just residues after application, but as toxin that can be spread throughout the home based process of evaporation and absorption and adsorption. This process was described in an article Published in 1998, and focused on the accumulation of pesticides in children’s toys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurunathan | first1 = S | last2 = Robson | first2 = M | last3 = Freeman | first3 = N | last4 = Buckley | first4 = B | last5 = Roy | first5 = A | last6 = Meyer | first6 = R | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Accumulation of chlorpyrifos on residential surfaces and toys accessible to children | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1289/ehp.981069| pmid = 9417768 | pmc = 1532945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ways to protect toys were summarized in popular magazines and web sites. The work was used in revisions of the EPA standards for use of the pesticide [[chlorpyrifos]] indoors. The complex issues of dust and semi-volatile toxins in homes were published in 2002 and 2006 review articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Freeman | first2 = NC | last3 = Millette | first3 = JR | year = 2002 | title = Dust: a metric for use in residential and building exposure assessment and source characterization | url = | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 110 | issue = 10| pages = 969–983 | doi=10.1289/ehp.02110969| pmid = 12361921 | pmc = 1241022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15.

During the late 1980s the state of NJ discovered that wastes from the refining and production of the chrome plated products had been used as apparent Clean fill in various residential settings, and was also had contaminated a number other industrial locations.Lioy conducted a comprehensive study of chromium wastes in Jersey City, including residential exposures and the bioavailability and size distribution if the wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Freeman | first2 = NCG | last3 = Wainman | first3 = T | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1992 | title = Microenvironmental analysis of residential exposure to chromium-laden wastes in and around New-Jersey homes | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 287–299 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1992.tb00676.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitsa | first1 = V | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Chow | first3 = JC | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1992 | title = Particle-Size Distribution of Chromium: Total and Hexavalent Chromium in Inspirable, Thoracic, and Respirable Soil Particles from Contaminated Sites in New Jersey | url = | journal = Aerosol Science and Technology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 213–229 | doi=10.1080/02786829208959572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work found that similar to current lead problems, the chromium exposures indoors were highly related to the levels found in house dust and not ambient air. In addition the use of dust laden corium as a marker of exposure was extremely valuable in conclusively defining that the removal of the wastes in the residential neighborhoods brought the levels of chromium down to background by the end of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freeman | first1 = NC | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Stern | first3 = AH | year = 2000 | title = Reduction in residential chromium following site remediation | url = | journal = Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association | volume = 50 | issue = 6| pages = 948–953 | doi=10.1080/10473289.2000.10464132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts are continuing in Jersey City and are now using analytical methods perfected at EOHSI to measure the levels of the hexavalent chromium (carcinogenic form) in human blood and in the areas around remaining industrial sites, that are beginning to receive final remediation. Acomprehensive review paper on this work was published by Stern, Gochfeld and Lioy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Gochfeld | first2 = M. | last3 = Lioy | first3 = P.J. | year = 2013 | title = Two decades of exposure assessment studies on chromate production waste in Jersey City, New Jersey--what we have learned about exposure characterization and its value to public health and remediation | url = | journal = J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 2–12 | doi=10.1038/jes.2012.100| pmid = 23131713 | pmc = 4286875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Trade Center dust===
In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC), Lioy was able to see the dust plumes from his home in [[Cranford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The major environmental and occupational health related issue during the aftermath of the building collapses was the size range and composition of the dust and smoke that was released during the first hours to days post collapse of the twin towers, and subsequently the dust that had deposited indoors and required cleanup. In collaboration with multiple laboratories, Lioy examined the composition and size distribution of the WTC dust in detail for [[inorganic]], [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[Ionic compound|ionic]] species. The results were published in a 2002 article entitled ''Characterization of the dust/smoke aerosol that settled east of the WTC in lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC September 11, 2001'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Weisel | first2 = CP | last3 = Millette | first3 = JR | last4 = Eisenreich | first4 = S | last5 = Vallero | first5 = D | last6 = Offenberg | first6 = J | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Characterization of the dust/smoke aerosol that settled east of the WTC in lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC 11 September 2001 | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 7| pages = 703–714 | doi=10.1289/ehp.02110703| pmid = 12117648 | pmc = 1240917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been used to understand the cause of the WTC cough and other health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prezant | first1 = DJ | last2 = Weiden | first2 = M | last3 = Banauch | first3 = GI | last4 = McGuinness | first4 = G | last5 = Rom | first5 = WN | last6 = Aldrich | first6 = TK | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Cough and bronchial responsiveness in firefighters at the WTC site | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 347 | issue = 11| pages = 806–815 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa021300 | pmid=12226151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other work that Lioy and colleagues published through 2009, they described the time line of exposure to the local population and workers from the moments after the collapse through December 2001, and pointed out the many lessons that can be learned from the WTC in order to effectively respond to other disasters.&lt;ref name="Lioy PJ 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Georgopoulos | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = The anatomy of the exposures that occurred around the World Trade Center site: 9/11 and beyond | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1076 | issue = | pages = 54–79 | doi=10.1196/annals.1371.002 | pmid=17119193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death, he was working with Dr. [[Philip J. Landrigan]] et al. of [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] on the long-term health effects experienced by WTC workers. During the aftermath Lioy was interviewed many times by the Media on WTC Dust related issues from October 2001 through 2011&lt;ref&gt;(See, e.g. [http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2011/sep/08/dust/ Decade 9/11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005160802/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2011/sep/08/dust/ |date=2012-10-05 }} and [http://beta.wnyc.org/people/paul-lioy/ Please Explain: Dust] - interviews with [[Leonard Lopate]] on [[National Public Radio]]; [http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/07/dr-sanjay-gupta-reports-terror-in-the-dust-debuts-wednesday-sept-7/ Terror in the Dust] - a documentary with [[Dr. Sanjay Gupta]] on [[CNN]]; and [http://blog.national911memorial.org/?p=4475 The Memo Blog: Exploring 9/11 - The World Before and After - Exploring Health Effects of WTC Dust])&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Lioy and his colleagues is mentioned in a book by Anthony Depalma entitled ''City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11''.&lt;ref&gt;DePalma A. (2010). City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11. Upper Saddle River, NJ, FT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy published a book on the WTC dust and his experiences entitled ''Dust: the Inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Lioy, P.J. 2010.

[[Image:Polar Bear 2004-11-15.jpg|right|180px|thumb|'''[[Polar bear]]''' in [[Manitoba]],  [[Canada]]. November 2004.]]
'''Polar seas''' is a collective term for the [[Arctic Ocean]] (about 4-5 percent of [[Earth|Earth's]] [[ocean]]s) and the southern part of the [[Southern Ocean]] (south of [[Antarctic Convergence]], about 10 percent of Earth's oceans). In the coldest years, sea ice can cover around 13 percent of the Earth's total surface at its maximum, but out of phase in the two hemispheres. The polar seas contain a huge [[biome]] with many [[organism]]s.

Among the species that inhabit various polar seas and surrounding land areas are [[polar bear]], [[reindeer]] (caribou), [[muskox]], [[wolverine]], [[ermine]], [[lemming]], [[Arctic hare]], [[Arctic ground squirrel]], [[whale]], [[harp seal]], and [[walrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ARCTIC WILDLIFE|url = http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Awildlife.html|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064515/http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Awildlife.html|archivedate = 2009-01-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These species have unique adaptations to the extreme conditions. Many might be endangered if they cannot adapt to changing conditions. Contrary to popular opinion, the World Wildlife Fund studies for polar bears show that this species has prospered since 1950, attaining five times the numbers found in 1950. In general, Arctic ecosystems are relatively fragile and slow to recover from serious damage.

==Arctic==
{{see also|Arctic}}
A large amount of the land in the north polar region is part of Earth's [[tundra]] [[biome]]. South of the Arctic tundra, where temperatures are a little less cold, are the vast forests of conifer trees of the [[taiga|taiga biome]]. North of the Arctic tundra are polar bears and the unique marine life of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name=polar-life&gt;{{cite web|title = Life in the Polar Regions: Animals, Plants, and Others in Extreme Environments|url = http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/polar/polar_life_intro.html&amp;edu=elem|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208154932/http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link%3D/earth/polar/polar_life_intro.html%26edu%3Delem|archivedate = 2008-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arctic ocean]] has relatively abundant plant life. Nutrients from rivers along with mixing and upwelling from storms contribute mixed layer nutrients which are essential for Arctic [[phytoplankton]] development. During summer, nearly continuous solar [[insolation]] encourages [[phytoplankton bloom|phytoplankta blooms]].
The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by [[continent]]s and has a few narrow, relatively shallow connections to the large ocean basins to the south. Large amounts of [[river]]ine [[fresh water]] as well as abundant nutrients (gelbstoff) flow into the Arctic basin from Siberian rivers. The widest continental shelf on the planet is found in the Arctic Ocean, extending more than 1000 kilometers outward from Siberia and Alaska. Consequently, much of the basin is very shallow. On the other hand, the Arctic Ocean contains the deepest, slowest spreading [[mid-ocean ridge]] on the planet which, until 2003, was thought to be inactive volcanically. Since then, however, a dozen active volcanoes have been discovered, illustrating the limited information available for the difficult-to-study Arctic Ocean. The numerous Siberian rivers flowing onto the shallow continental shelf freshen the seawater. These rivers have shown increased flow recently, possibly due to increased global rainfall as a result of climate change. A flow increase may raise the level of riverine nutrients. Severe Siberian drought, as experienced in 2010, could, however, decrease flows.
There is an interest in a potential release of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas, from methane clathrates present in the Arctic continental shelf sediments, if sufficient ocean warming were to occur.
As much as 80% of the ocean surface is covered by ice in winter, declining to about 60% in summer; ice cover has been declining at a steady and rapid pace.
A large fraction of the ice is multi-year ice, and in the far North the thickness can be more than 2m. In summer, ice tends to melt at the air-sea interface. Surface melt ponds are formed, increasing the [[albedo]].

==Antarctic==
{{see also|Antarctic}}
Most of [[Antarctica]] is covered with a thick layer of [[ice]], with few species permanently living in the ice-covered areas. There are many species of [[penguin]]s in the south polar region. Almost all animals in Antarctica find their food in the Southern Ocean surrounding the continent, and there is abundant marine life in the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=polar-life/&gt;

Because of the extreme but constant habitats, small disruption or damage could alter the polar systems. Although they are remote from human world, polar seas are not 'pristine' environments. Compared with the Antarctic region, the Arctic has long history of interaction with man. The polar food web structure can be sensitive to man's 'top-down' control especially with the development and growth of industrial fishing.
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that influences life in polar areas. There is observational evidence that the Antarctica climate is a bellwether for climate change in the northern hemisphere, leading by about 1000 years. The study of Antarctic ice, its distribution, changes in ice volume, and other indicators of the continental climate in Antarctica are at an early stage of development and even earlier stage of understanding. Techniques for studying the terrain beneath the ice are just being explored. Lake Vostok, buried under miles of ice, has not been penetrated to date. There is evidence that it has been out of contact with the atmosphere for millions of years, making it a possible treasure trove of information.

Relatively, the Antarctic seas and [[Southern ocean]] surround the highest, driest, coldest and windiest continent on the earth - [[Antarctica]]. Due to the low mean temperature, there is no riverine input into the Antarctic seas. And little input DOM, POC from land. In addition to relatively thin sea ice, thick and extensive ice shelves (floating glaciers) are present in the Antarctic region. More than 90% of the sea ice is first year (annual) ice and less than 2m thick. The first confirmed sighting of [[Antarctica]] can date back to the 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 10 years of Antarctic protection!|url = http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/10_years_of_antarctic_protecti.html|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081222121544/http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/10_years_of_antarctic_protecti.html|archivedate = 2008-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in global climate ==
{{See also|Climate of the Arctic|Global warming in the Arctic}}

The polar seas play an important role in the [[global climate]]:
* Carbon export/[[carbon sequestration]]: Effects concentration of [[carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere]].
* [[Dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP/DMS) production: DMSP/DMS serves as the nucleus in [[cloud formation]] and changes the regional [[albedo]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].
* [[Earth's energy budget]]: clouds increase albedo, sea-ice increases albedo, ice shelves increase albedo etc.
* Formation of deep and bottom waters: the polar areas are the source of ocean deep and bottom cold waters. Due to the sinking of cold and dense saline waters near Greenland, and at the Antarctic Convergence, among other sites, the global ocean circulation is maintained.

Models predict a latitudinal effect in response to climate change. These would be expected to be first obvious in polar and subpolar regions. The decline of arctic ocean summer ice coverage was assumed to be one such sign, however, the reversal of that trend leaves the question open as the origins of the now reversed 30 year trend. In 1979, the cover of Time magazine was illustrated with an image of arctic ice covering and expanding BEYOND the arctic basin, opinion seems to have little value. Real data reveal the trend of ice coverage to be on the increase. If this increase will continue, only time will tell.  Developed nations ceased the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and the atmospheric abundance and consequent ozone depletion are generally on the decrease. [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] Breaking-off of polar ice shelves is a continuing process with increases in Western Antarctica balanced by decreases in Eastern Antarctica. Careful study has revealed that the volume of ice in Western Antarctica was incorrectly estimated and shows no significant change attributable to climate change over the observation period.

== Characteristics ==
Extreme oscillations in irradiance occur in these regions, for months it may be totally dark (in winter) or light (in summer). Because of the existence of polar ice, surface reflectance of sunlight is very high. In addition the solar angle are relatively quite low. So less light can penetrate into water and becomes bio available to the plants in polar water under the ice cover. Water temperatures are low, but do not change much seasonally. The low temperature and low available high irradiance together limit [[primary production]]. Major nutrients (N, P, Si) are often not limiting [[primary production]]. Blooming of [[Phytoplankton]] happens in summer, because of the decreased salinity (sea ice melt-water), lower mixing, higher stratification, higher temperature and more bio available light.

Ice is very important in structuring environment. It regulates the physics, chemistry and biology of the water column, air-sea exchange, and is also an important habitat.

== Development ==
There is an expected rise in the exploration and development of the Polar Seas due to an increasing demand for fuel and commodities. The emergence of China and India's economy is considered one of the main drivers of this phenomenon due to an unprecedented appetite for raw materials and fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arctic Doom, Arctic Boom: The Geopolitics of Climate Change in the Arctic|last=Zellen|first=Barry|publisher=ABC CLIO|year=2009|isbn=9780313380129|location=Santa Barbara|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Presently, there are still no exact figures that define the oil and gas reserves in the Polar Seas. Initial explorations, however, have resulted in the identification of its potential. For example, Canada's explorations discovered gas and oil in several Arctic locations such as Beaufort, High Arctic (Arctic Islands), Labrador, and Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antarctic Treaty System: An Assessment : Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Beardmore South Field Camp, Antarctica, January 7-13, 1985|last=Polar Research Board|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1986|isbn=0309036402|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arctic Islands alone has an estimated 4.3 billion barrels of oil reserve while those locations that fall within the Alaskan continental shelf have potential recoverable reserves worth $18 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Polar Research Board, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are now 46 nations that are parties to cooperation and treaties covering the polar regions. Several of these, either individually or with partners, conduct research and explorations in the Arctic and Antarctic seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Environment Outlook: Environment for Development, GEO 4|last=United Nations Environmental Programme|first=|publisher=UNEP/Progress Press|year=2007|isbn=9789280728729|location=Valetta|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are governed by international environmental protocols. However, countries like China, which faces a future oil shortage, are aggressively exploring the region for the purpose of oil extraction despite an international ban on such activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emerging Politics of Antarctica|last=Brady|first=Anne-Marie|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415531399|location=London|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Precision engineering''' is a subdiscipline of [[electrical engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[optical engineering]] concerned with designing machines, fixtures, and other structures that have exceptionally high [[tolerances]], are repeatable, and are stable over time. These approaches have applications in [[machine tool]]s, [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]], [[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]], [[optoelectronics]] design, and many other fields. 

== Overview ==
One of the fundamental principles in precision engineering is that of determinism.  System behavior is fully predictable even to nanometer-scale motions. To do the job efficiently and correctly to fit your need via modern machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnbprecision.com/|title=Precision Engineers {{!}} MNB Precision|last=Precision|first=MNB|website=MNB Precision|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The basic idea is that machine tools obey cause and effect relationships that are within our ability to understand and control and that there is nothing random or probabilistic about their behavior.  Everything happens for a reason and the list of reasons is small enough to manage." - Jim Bryan

"By this we mean that machine tool errors obey cause-and-effect relationships, and do not vary randomly for no reason.  Further, the causes are not esoteric and uncontrollable, but can be explained in terms of familiar engineering principles."   - Bob Donaldson

Professors Hiromu Nakazawa and Pat McKeown provide the following list of goals for precision engineering:

# Create a highly precise movement.
# Reduce the dispersion of the product's or part's function.
# Eliminate fitting and promote assembly, especially automatic assembly.
# Reduce the initial cost.
# Reduce the running cost.
# Extend the life span.
# Enable the design safety factor to be lowered.
# Improve interchangeability of components so that corresponding parts made by other factories or firms can be used in their place.
# Improve quality control through higher machine accuracy capabilities and hence reduce scrap, rework, and conventional inspection.
# Achieve a greater wear/fatigue life of components.
# Make functions independent of one another.
# Achieve greater miniaturization and packing densities.
# Achieve further advances in technology and the underlying sciences."&lt;ref name="venkatesh-izman"&gt;Venkatesh, V. C. and Izman, Sudin, ''Precision Engineering'', Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Limited, 2007, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The network of hyphae is referred to as a [[mycelium]], which is fundamental to fungal nutrition.]]
'''Saprotrophic nutrition''' {{IPAc-en|s|æ|p|r|ə|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|f|ɪ|k|,_|-|p|r|oʊ|-}}{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/saprotroph |title=saprotroph - definition of saprotroph in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=2016-01-20 }}}} or '''lysotrophic nutrition''' is a process of [[Chemotroph#Chemoheterotroph|chemoheterotrophic]] [[extracellular digestion]] involved in the processing of decayed (dead or waste) [[organic matter]]. It occurs in '''saprotrophs''' and [[heterotroph]]s, and is most often associated with [[fungus|fungi]] (for example ''[[Mucor]]'') and soil [[bacteria]]. Saprotrophic microscopic fungi are sometimes called '''saprobes'''; saprotrophic plants or [[microbiome#Bacterial flora|bacterial flora]] are called '''saprophytes''' ([[wikt:sapro-|sapro-]] + [[wikt:-phyte|-phyte]], "rotten material" + "plant"), though it is now believed that all plants previously thought to be saprotrophic are in fact [[myco-heterotrophy|parasites of microscopic fungi]] or [[Parasitic_plant|other plants]]. The process is most often facilitated through the [[active transport]] of such materials through [[endocytosis]] within the internal mycelium and its constituent [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}} states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various word roots relating to decayed matter (''detritus'', ''[[wikt:sapro|sapro-]]''), eating and nutrition (''-vore'', ''-phage''), and plants or life forms (''[[wikt:-phyte|-phyte]]'', ''-obe'') produce various terms, such as [[detritivore]], detritophage, saprotroph, saprophyte, saprophage, and saprobe; their meanings overlap, although technical distinctions (based on physiologic mechanisms) narrow the [[word sense|senses]]. For example, [[usage]] distinctions can be made based on macroscopic swallowing of detritus (as an earthworm does) versus microscopic [[lysis]] of detritus (as a mushroom does).

A '''facultative saprophyte''' appears on stressed or dying plants and may combine with the live pathogens.{{cn|date=March 2016}}.

== Process ==
&lt;!-- We need there to be a picture of the process. I'll endeavour to create one, but as ever.. I'm not an expert on such matters. [[User:JCraw|Jordan Craw]] --&gt;
As matter decomposes within a medium  in which a saprotroph is residing, the saprotroph breaks such matter down into its composites.

* [[Protein]]s are broken down into their [[amino acid]] composites through the breaking of peptide bonds by [[protease]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}}, fig 14.16—Diagram detailing the re-absorption of substrates within the hypha.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lipid]]s are broken down into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]] by [[lipase]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16" /&gt;
* [[Starch]] is broken down into pieces of simple disaccharides by [[amylase]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16" /&gt;

These products are re-absorbed into the hypha through the cell wall via [[endocytosis]] and passed on throughout the mycelium complex. This facilitates the passage of such materials throughout the organism and allows for growth and, if necessary, repair.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

=== Conditions ===
In order for a saprotrophic organism to facilitate optimal growth and repair, favourable conditions and nutrients must be present.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}}, fig 14.17—A diagram explaining the optimal conditions needed for successful growth and repair.&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal conditions refers to several conditions which optimise the growth of saprotrophic organisms, such as;

# '''Presence of water''': 80–90% of the fungi is composed of water by mass, and requires excess water for absorption due to the evaporation of internally retent water.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Presence of oxygen''': Very few saprotrophic organisms can endure anaerobic conditions as evidenced by their growth above media such as water or soil.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Neutral-acidic pH''': The condition of neutral or mildly acidic conditions under [[pH]] 7 are required. &lt;!-- I know why, but i need to reference it :-/ --&gt;&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Low-medium temperature''': The majority of saprotrophic organisms require temperatures between 1&amp;nbsp;°C and 35&amp;nbsp;°C, with optimum growth occurring at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;

The majority of nutrients taken in by such organisms must be able to provide carbon, proteins, vitamins and in some cases, [[ion]]s. Due to the carbon composition of the majority of organisms, dead and organic matter provide rich sources of disaccharides and polysaccharides such as  [[maltose]] and [[starch]], and of the monosaccharide [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

In terms of nitrogen-rich sources, saprotrophs require combined protein for the creation of proteins, which is facilitated by the absorption of amino acids, and usually taken from rich soil. Although both ions and vitamins are rare, thiamine or ions such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium aid the growth of the mycelium.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4327">{{Tort law}}
The '''tort of seduction''' was a civil wrong or [[tort]] in [[common law]] legal systems, and still exists in some jurisdictions. 

An unmarried woman could sue on the grounds of [[seduction]] to obtain damages from her seducer, if her [[Sexual consent|consent to sex]] was based upon his misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="pos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Posner|year=1994|title=Sex and Reason|page=81|isbn=0-674-80279-9|quote=The tort of seduction allows an unmarried woman (formerly her father or other guardian), usually but not always a virgin, to obtain damages from her seducer, provided that he made misrepresentations to obtain her consent to sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
Initially, the tort of seduction was a remedy for a father's property interest in his daughter's chastity.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; However, the damages to which the father would be entitled were based on the father's loss of the working services of a daughter, much as a master could sue if a third-party caused injury to his servant that rendered the servant unable to work, because she was "seduced and debauched" and became pregnant as a result of nonmarital sexual activity. The tort of seduction was one of the most common civil actions toward the end of the 19th century, and fathers were often successful before juries.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20030211.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 20th century, the action was criticised as maintaining "property interests in humans", and the tort was recast to recognize personal injury to the woman, rather than solely deprivation of a father's property right. Most jurisdictions granted the victim (the wronged woman) the right to sue in her own name. (Fathers could still sue as well, on the ground that they had a moral interest in their daughters' chastity).&lt;ref name=findlaw /&gt; The suing woman was "usually but not always a virgin".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt;

==England==
Historically, the seduced female could not bring a suit herself. Rather, it would be brought by her father, acting under the [[legal fiction]] that the parent-child relationship falls under the master-servant relationship. However, if the daughter was a contracted servant, a suit could not be brought by her father against her master.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==Canada==
[[Property and civil rights]] is a [[federalism|provincial power]] in [[Canada]], so all torts can vary by province.

===Ontario===
An Act to make the remedy for cases of seduction more effectual, and to tender the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support, was passed in [[Upper Canada]] on March 4, 1837. Amending traditional [[common law]], it allowed fathers to sue their daughters' masters for the tort of seduction. It also held [[biological father]]s liable for children conceived out of wedlock.

The Seduction Act was repealed in 1978.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey|first=Martha|year=1991|title=Girls and Masters: The Tort of Seduction and the Support of Bastards|journal=Canadian Journal of Family Law|volume=10|pages=137–162|url=http://faculty.law.ubc.ca/cdnjfl/art/1011991.html#bailey|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
The 1934 [[John Brownlee sex scandal]] revolved around a seduction suit.

===Other provinces===
An 1852 statute in [[Prince Edward Island]] allowed for a seduced woman to sue for herself with this tort.,&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; although damages were capped at 100 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. [[Manitoba]] and the [[North West Territories]] enacted similar legislation around the turn of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the tort of seduction has been abolished in "most states".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt; Fears of fraudulent suits, combined with a turn away from the view of property interests in persons, led to the enactment of "[[heart balm]]" statutes, abolishing causes of action for seduction, [[breach of promise]], [[alienation of affection]], [[criminal conversation]], etc. in most states in the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">A '''squeeze''' or '''squeeze paper''' is a reverse copy of an [[Epigraphy|inscription]], made by applying moist [[filter paper]] and pushing into the indentations by percussive use of a stiff brush.   The paper is allowed to dry and then removed.  The image is reversed from the inscription, and  protrudes from the squeeze paper.

The use of a squeeze allows more information to be gleaned than examining the original inscription, for example curves inside the cuts can identify the scribe who originally carved the inscription.&lt;ref name="TIH"&gt;Taking Inscriptions Home  University of Reading, Ure Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Squeezes can also (and some have been since the 1950s) be made by applying layers of [[liquid latex]].  This method works best on horizontal surfaces.&lt;ref name="TIH" /&gt;

Modern digitising methods mean that the image can be restored to the original orientation.

Large collections of squeezes are held by the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' and other epigraphic collections.

The general objectives of '''strategic urban planning''' (SUP) include clarifying which [[city]] model is desired and working towards that goal, coordinating public and private efforts, channelling energy, adapting to new circumstances and improving the living conditions of the citizens affected.

Strategic planning is a technique that has been applied to many facets of human activity; we have only to mention [[Sun Tzu]], Arthur Thomson or [[Henry Mintzberg]]; however, the application of strategic planning to urban contexts, or cities, regions and other [[metropolitan areas]] is a relatively recent development whose beginnings were eminently practical and artistical: a mixture of thought, techniques and art or expertise.

Fifteen years of practice proved to be enough time for the technique to spread and for the first “Meeting of American and European cities for the Exchange of Experiences in Strategic Planning” to be organized. Institutions sponsoring the meeting, held in [[Barcelona]] in 1993, included the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[European Community]] Commission and the Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute. The cities of [[Amsterdam]], [[Lisbon]], [[Lille]], Barcelona, [[Toronto]] and [[Santiago de Chile]] participated, among others.

At that meeting it was demonstrated, along with other relevant aspects, that if cooperative processes are used in large cities in order to carry out strategic planning processes, and if a reasonable degree of comprehension is reached between the administration, businesses and an ample representation of social agents, organizational synergies will develop that will eventually improve resource management and citizens’ quality of life.

== History==
Strategic Urban Planning processes (SUP), also known as Urban Renewal Projects, began to appear at the end of the 20th century. The city of [[San Francisco]] (U.S.A.) carried out its process between 1982 and 1984. The main motivation behind starting strategic urban planning processes was the attempt to adequately react to problematic situations (mainly economic crisis or standstill). At the beginning of the 21st century, this kind of organization is not reactive but proactive. In the case of [[Spain]], crisis situations are not the main causes of these processes, rather they are motivated by the search for an improved level of public-private cooperation, the wish to coordinate activity, continued improvements, the wish to launch revitalization processes and even to follow others . The initial determination needed to launch this type of processes varies by region; in Spain, most processes are fronted by public entities, approximately 50%, while a significant percentage has mixed public-private leadership.

== Description of SUP processes==
An SUP process, according to Borja and Castells is:

''The definition of a city project that unifies diagnoses, specifies public and private actions and establishes a coherent mobilization framework for the cooperation of urban social actors. A participative process is a priority when defining contents, as this process will be the basis for the viability of the objectives and actions proposed. The result of the Strategic plan should not necessarily be the creation of regulations or a government program (although its adoption by the State and Local Government should mean the instigation of regulations, investment, administrative measures, policy initiatives, etc) but rather a policy contract between public institutions and civil society. For this reason, the process following the approval of the plan and the monitoring and implementation of measures or actions is just as or more important than the process of elaboration and consensual approval.''

SUP is now considered a type of [[Governance]].

== Basic Stages of an SUP process==
* Using the work of the Technical Secretary as a starting point, work groups debate and approve a diagnosis of the city that includes its localisation. The document must be approved by the Executive Committee, by the General Council or a full meeting of the Corporation as the case may be.
* Based on the diagnosis, and keeping in mind its antecedents and conclusions, strengths and weaknesses, the next step is the creation of scenarios and, based on the use of imagination and rigour, the development of prospective tasks related to the creation of future alternatives so that the Executive Committee can select a model or vision for the city. Their choice will be the basis for the generation of related key topics and/or directions for general actions to be taken.
* Once the work teams have been reorganized, mainly made up of key decision-makers and implementers, each key topic and line of action will be dealt with separately, designing a detailed list of necessary and/or advisable projects. Once the results have been consolidated, a prioritised list of projects will be made available from which a selection will be made. The next step is the elaboration of an action plan that includes the agents involved, timing and resources. The people involved in the structure of the process, at least theoretically, are capable of carrying it out; for an example, please consult the document from the General Council of SUP of Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm].
* Once all of the previously mentioned documents have been approved, the next step is implementation - carrying out the project itself. This stage is decisive; at this point plans are usually given a structure in which the organization is even more explicitly clarified.

== Implementation of SUP processes==
The social and economic importance of these processes is quite relevant as they affect millions of people [https://web.archive.org/web/20050101023909/http://www.cideu.org/site/] . In Spain, [http://www.ebropolis.es/web/index.asp] there are nearly one hundred localities that use this methodology, affecting a total population of nearly 15 million people.

== Critical Comments on SUP processes==
Sectors in the area of civic participation, as well as planning professionals and political activists have all expressed criticism of SUP processes.

However, SUP processes include aspects that favour selective participation, territorial organization and coordination/cooperation between public and private sectors. On the other hand, Strategic Urban Planning processes seem to be independent of political ideologies (for example, the SUP processes in Barcelona [http://www.bcn2000.es/en/default_en.aspx], Bilbao [http://www.bm30.es/] and Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm] are carried out with mixed Government teams including the following Spanish political formations: PSC-PSOE  [http://www.socialistes.cat/home/], PNV [http://www.eaj-pnv.eu/] and PP [http://www.pp.es/] respectively) and can produce a notable degree of stability in the majority behind the project.

== Theoretical Development==
Knowledge relating to strategic urban planning processes is evolving in two complementary directions that can be denominated, borrowing concepts from programming, as Bottom-Up and Top-down.

=== Bottom-Up===
There are clear differences between what could be called the traditional approach to Strategic planning and the emerging approach (Fernández Güell. Strategic planning of cities).
* Before Product predominance, now Process predominance
* Before Sector specific, now Integrated
* Before Normative, now Strategic
* Before Goal-oriented, now Cost-benefit oriented
* Before Urban-offer oriented, now Urban-demand oriented
* Before Subject to administrative limitations, now Supersedes administrative limitations and enters in Metropolitan areas
* Before Open participation, now Focused Participation

Of course, in 2006 there was a clear evolution that attempted to adapt to changes, political sensitivities and even trends. In any case, this is a line of thought and action that takes full advantage of the experience of projects that have already been implemented.

=== Top-Down===
Given that:
* The influence of each agent in the global process under consideration for implementation is yet to be determined;
* There are no generally accepted criteria when creating instruments for measuring progress or regression on the path toward achieving main goals;
* Cooperation processes among different agents within the city to carry out strategic planning are usually undertaken using a “framework” organisational structure which highlights differences;
* Both politics and outside events affect a large city;

this line of research seeks to further the design of a model that will determine the factors related to the success of strategic planning processes in large cities and metropolitan areas [https://web.archive.org/web/20090727100029/http://alarcos.inf-cr.uclm.es/per/fruiz/audes5/index.htm] [[:es:Aglomeraciones urbanas en la Unión Europea]] [[:es:Area Metropolitana]] [[:es:Área metropolitana de Valencia]].

Within this branch of research, which seeks a more general theory, two recent Doctoral Theses mentioned in the bibliography can be consulted for further information.

It should be pointed out that a theory explaining Strategic Urban Planning in Metropolitan Areas and/or Regions would involve furthering the consolidation of Social Design [[:es:Diseño Social]] as a scientific study.

[[Image:FlattenedRoundPills.jpg|thumb|Common disk-shaped tablets]]

A '''tablet''' is a [[Pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] dosage form. Tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medicament or medicaments with or without suitable [[excipient]]s and prepared either by molding or by compression. It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in [[powder (substance)|powder]] form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. The excipients can include [[diluent]]s, [[Binder (material)|binder]]s or granulating agents, [[glidant]]s (flow aids) and [[lubricant]]s to ensure efficient tabletting; [[Excipient#Disintegrants|disintegrant]]s to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; [[sweetener]]s or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to [[controlled release|control the release rate]] of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance.

The compressed tablet is the most popular [[dosage form]] in use today. About two-thirds of all [[medical prescription|prescription]]s are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered [[Sublingual administration|sublingually]], [[Buccal administration|buccally]], [[rectum|rectally]] or [[Vagina|intravaginally]].  The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as [[syrup]]s, [[elixir]]s, [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s, and [[emulsion]]s. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter.

==History==
Pills are thought to date back to around 1500 BC.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/25/health/he-booster25|title=The Colorful History of Pills Can Fill Many a Tablet|work=latimes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919164837/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/25/health/he-booster25|archivedate=2015-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier medical recipes, such as those from 4000 BC, were for liquid preparations rather than solids.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The first references to pills were found on papyruses in ancient Egypt, and contained bread dough, honey or grease. Medicinal ingredients, such as plant powders or spices, were mixed in and formed by hand to make little balls, or pills.
In ancient Greece, such medicines were known as ''katapotia'' ("something to be swallowed"), and the Roman scholar Pliny, who lived from 23-79 AD, first gave a name to what we now call pills, calling them ''pilula''.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

Pills have always been difficult to swallow and efforts long have been made to make them go down easier. In medieval times, people coated pills with slippery plant substances. Another approach, used as recently as the 19th century, was to gild them in gold and silver, although this often meant that they would pass through the digestive tract with no effect.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; In the 1800s sugar-coating and gelatin-coating was invented, as were [[Capsule (pharmacy)|gelatin capsules]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

In 1843, the British painter and inventor [[William Brockedon]] was granted a patent for a machine capable of "Shaping Pills, Lozenges and Black Lead by Pressure in Dies". The device was capable of compressing powder into a tablet without use of an adhesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/b19974760M4060#page/n45/mode/2up/search/brockedon | title=Inventor of the Compressed Tablet: William Brockedon | journal=The Chemist and Druggist | date=August 1954 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514050039/https://archive.org/stream/b19974760M4060#page/n45/mode/2up/search/brockedon | archivedate=2016-05-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Pill===
[[Image:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|right|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill]]s were nicknamed "the pill" in the 1960s{{citation needed &lt;!-- colloquialism in generic degree disallowed --&gt;|date=February 2016}}]]
A pill was originally defined as a small, round, solid pharmaceutical [[oral administration|oral]] [[dosage form]] of medication. The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates [[hydrozincite]] and [[smithsonite]]. The pills were used for sore eyes, and were found aboard a Roman ship [[Relitto del Pozzino]] which wrecked in 140 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23049-worlds-oldest-pills-treated-sore-eyes.html|title=World's oldest pills treated sore eyes|work=New Scientist|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=5 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122102750/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23049-worlds-oldest-pills-treated-sore-eyes.html|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1193|title=Ingredients of a 2,000-y-old medicine revealed by chemical, mineralogical, and botanical investigations|work=PNAS|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=5 February 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216776110|volume=110|pages=1193–1196|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208021858/http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1193|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=|pmc=3557061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, pills include tablets, capsules, and variants thereof like caplets — essentially, any solid form of medication colloquially falls into the pill category.

===Caplet===
[[Image:Four colors of pills.jpg|thumb|Variations on a common tablet design, which can be distinguished by both color and shape]]
A caplet is a smooth, coated, oval-shaped medicinal tablet in the general shape of a [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]. Many caplets have an indentation running down the middle so they may be split in half more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/article/pill-splitting.html |title=Pill Splitting - A Safe Way to Save Healthcare Dollars? |last=Anderson |first=Leigh |publisher=[[Drugs.com]] |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2016-04-29 |quote=Many pills that can be safely split have a “score”, a line down the middle of the pill, that allows for easier splitting. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501013112/http://www.drugs.com/article/pill-splitting.html |archivedate=2016-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their inception, capsules have been viewed by consumers as the most efficient method of taking medication. For this reason, producers of drugs such as [[Over-the-counter drugs|OTC]] analgesics wanting to emphasize the strength of their product developed the “caplet”, a [[portmanteau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Safire | first=William | date=1986-03-09 | title=On Language; The Caplet Solution | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/magazine/on-language-the-caplet-solution.html | magazine=The New York Times | accessdate=2017-12-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213143526/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/magazine/on-language-the-caplet-solution.html | archivedate=2017-12-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of “capsule-shaped tablet”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Comparison of Two Forms of Loperamide–Simeticone and a Probiotic Yeast (Saccharomyces boulardii) in the Treatment of Acute Diarrhoea in Adults: A Randomised Non-Inferiority Clinical Trial | doi=10.1007/s40268-015-0111-y | url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40268-015-0111-y.pdf | pmc=4662947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thcesaurus&amp;code=C69002&amp;ns=NCI_Thesaurus | title=Compressed Sugar Coated Caplet Dosage Form (Code C69002) | publisher=NCI Thesaurus | accessdate=2017-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to tie this positive association to more efficiently-produced tablet pills, as well as being an easier-to-swallow shape than the usual disk-shaped tablet.

===Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT)===


An [[orally disintegrating tablet]] or orodispersible tablet (ODT), is a drug [[dosage form]] available for a limited range of [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medications.

==Tabletting formulations==
In the tablet-pressing process, it is important that all ingredients be fairly dry, powdered or granular, somewhat uniform in particle size, and freely flowing. Mixed particle sized powders  segregate during manufacturing operations due to different densities, which can result in tablets with poor drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content uniformity, but [[Granulation (making of granules)|granulation]] should prevent this. Content uniformity ensures that the same API dose is delivered with each tablet.

Some APIs may be tableted as pure substances, but this is rarely the case; most formulations include [[excipient]]s. Normally, a pharmacologically inactive ingredient (excipient) termed a ''binder'' is added to help hold the tablet together and give it strength. A wide variety of binders may be used, some common ones including [[lactose]], dibasic calcium phosphate, [[sucrose]], corn (maize) starch, microcrystalline [[cellulose]], povidone [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]] and modified cellulose (for example hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose).

Often, an ingredient is also needed to act as a ''disintegrant'' to aid tablet dispersion once swallowed, releasing the API for absorption. Some binders, such as starch and cellulose, are also excellent disintegrants.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Tablets are simple and convenient to use. They provide an accurately measured dosage of the active ingredient in a convenient portable package, and can be designed to protect unstable medications or disguise unpalatable ingredients. Colored coatings, embossed markings and printing can be used to aid tablet recognition. Manufacturing processes and techniques can provide tablets with special properties, for example, [[controlled release|sustained release or fast dissolving formulations]].

Some drugs may be unsuitable for administration by the oral route. For example, [[protein]] drugs such as [[insulin]] may be [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by stomach acids. Such drugs cannot be made into tablets. Some drugs may be deactivated by the [[liver]] when they are carried there from the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] by the [[hepatic portal vein]] (the "[[first pass effect]]"), making them unsuitable for oral use. Drugs which can be taken [[sublingual administration|sublingually]] are absorbed through the [[oral mucosa]], so that they bypass the liver and are less susceptible to the first pass effect. The oral [[bioavailability]] of some drugs may be low due to poor [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] from the gastrointestinal tract. Such drugs may need to be given in very high doses or by [[injection (medicine)|injection]]. For drugs that need to have rapid onset, or that have severe [[side effect]]s, the oral route may not be suitable. For example, [[salbutamol]], used to treat problems in the [[respiratory system]], can have effects on the [[heart]] and [[circulatory system|circulation]] if taken orally; these effects are greatly reduced by inhaling smaller doses direct to the required site of action. A proportion of the population have difficulties swallowing tablets either because they just don't like taking them or because their medical condition makes it difficult for them ([[dysphagia]], [[vomiting]]).  In such instances it may be better to consider alternative dosage form or administration route.

==Tablet properties==
Tablets can be made in virtually any shape, although requirements of patients and tableting machines mean that most are round, oval or capsule shaped. More unusual shapes have been manufactured but patients find these harder to swallow, and they are more vulnerable to chipping or manufacturing problems.

Tablet diameter and shape are determined by the machine tooling used to produce them - a die plus an upper and a lower punch are required. This is called a station of tooling. The thickness is determined by the amount of tablet material and the position of the punches in relation to each other during compression. Once this is done, we can measure the corresponding pressure applied during compression. The shorter the distance between the punches, thickness, the greater the pressure applied during compression, and sometimes the harder the tablet. Tablets need to be hard enough that they don't break up in the bottle, yet friable enough that they disintegrate in the gastric tract.

Tablets need to be strong enough to resist the stresses of packaging, shipping and handling by the pharmacist and patient.  The mechanical strength of tablets is assessed using a combination of (i) simple failure and erosion tests, and (ii) more sophisticated engineering tests. The simpler tests are often used for quality control purposes, whereas the more complex tests are used during the design of the formulation and manufacturing process in the research and development phase.  Standards for tablet properties are published in the various international pharmacopeias (USP/NF, EP, JP, etc.).  The hardness of tablets is the principle measure of mechanical strength.  Hardness is tested using a [[Tablet hardness testing|tablet hardness tester]].  The units for hardness have evolved since the 1930s, but are commonly measured in kilograms per square centimeter. Models of tester include the Monsanto (or Stokes) Hardness Tester from 1930, the Pfizer Hardness Tester from 1950, the Strong Cob Hardness Tester and the Heberlain (or Schleeniger) Hardness Tester.

Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and ejection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall, as well as between granules, which helps in uniform filling of the die.

Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are the most frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules.

==Manufacturing==

===Manufacture of the tableting blend===
In the tablet pressing process, the main guideline is to ensure that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet.  Hence, all the ingredients should be well-mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet. Two basic techniques are used to granulate powders for compression into a tablet: wet granulation and dry granulation.  Powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through direct compression.

===Wet granulation===
Wet granulation is a process of using a liquid binder to lightly agglomerate the powder mixture.  The amount of liquid has to be properly controlled, as over-wetting will cause the granules to be too hard and under-wetting will cause them to be too soft and friable. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solvent-based systems but may not be suitable for drugs which are degraded by hydrolysis.
;Procedure
# The active ingredient and excipients are weighed and mixed.
# The wet granulate is prepared by adding the liquid binder–adhesive to the powder blend and mixing thoroughly. Examples of binders/adhesives include aqueous preparations of cornstarch, natural gums such as acacia, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, [[gelatin]], and povidone.
# Screening the damp mass through a mesh to form pellets or granules.
# Drying the granulation.  A conventional tray-dryer or fluid-bed dryer are most commonly used.
# After the granules are dried, they are passed through a screen of smaller size than the one used for the wet mass to create granules of uniform size.

Low shear wet granulation processes use very simple mixing equipment, and can take a considerable time to achieve a uniformly mixed state.  High shear wet granulation processes use equipment that mixes the powder and liquid at a very fast rate, and thus speeds up the manufacturing process. Fluid bed granulation is a multiple-step wet granulation process performed in the same vessel to pre-heat, granulate, and dry the powders.  It is used because it allows close control of the granulation process.

===Dry granulation===
Dry granulation processes create granules by light compaction of the powder blend under low pressures. The compacts so-formed are broken up gently to produce granules (agglomerates). This process is often used when the product to be granulated is sensitive to moisture and heat. Dry granulation can be conducted on a tablet press using slugging tooling or on a roll press called a roller compactor. Dry granulation equipment offers a wide range of pressures to attain proper densification and granule formation. Dry granulation is simpler than wet granulation, therefore the cost is reduced. However, dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fine granules, which can compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet. Dry granulation requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties, and a 'dry binder' may need to be added to the formulation to facilitate the formation of granules.

===Hot melt extrusion===
Hot melt extrusion is utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles.The extruded particles can then be blended and compressed into tablets or filled into capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrusion Speheronisation|url=http://www.pharmacmc.com/extrusion-spheronisation/|website=PharmaCMC.com|accessdate=26 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001113908/http://www.pharmacmc.com/extrusion-spheronisation/|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Granule lubrication===
After granulation, a final lubrication step is used to ensure that the tableting blend does not stick to the equipment during the tableting process.  This usually involves low shear blending of the granules with a powdered lubricant, such as [[magnesium stearate]] or [[stearic acid]].

===Manufacture of the tablets===
[[File:Tabletfailure.jpg|thumb|right|Tablets that failed due to capping and lamination compared to a normal tablet]]
Whatever process is used to make the tableting blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar.  First, the powder is filled into the die from above.  The mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density.  At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch.  After die filling, the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%.  The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500–50 [[millisecond|ms]] per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled up and out of the die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die.  This process is repeated for each tablet.

Common problems encountered during tablet manufacturing operations include:
* Fluctuations in tablet weight, usually caused by uneven powder flow into the die due to poor powder flow properties.
* Fluctuations in dosage of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, caused by uneven distribution of the API in the tableting blend (either due to poor mixing or separation in process).
* Sticking of the powder blend to the tablet tooling, due to inadequate lubrication, worn or dirty tooling, or a sticky powder formulation
* Capping, lamination or chipping.  This is caused by air being compressed with the tablet formulation and then expanding when the punch is released: if this breaks the tablet apart, it can be due to incorrect machine settings, or due to incorrect formulation: either because the tablet formulation is too brittle or not adhesive enough, or because the powder being fed to the tablet press contains too much air (has too low bulk density).
* Capping can also occur due to high moisture content.

===Tablet compaction simulator===
Tablet formulations are designed and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This is a computer controlled device that can measure the punch positions, punch pressures, friction forces, die wall pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation.
Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press. Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development.

===Tablet presses===
[[Image:Tablet press animation.gif|thumb|The tablet pressing operation (click image to enlarge)]]
[[Image:Old tablet press.jpg|thumb|An old Cadmach rotary tablet press]]
[[Tablet press]]es, also called tableting machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet at a time (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&amp;D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust the position of the lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled.  This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches).  Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression.  Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.
There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1861/|title=Articles :: ГК "Аптека-95"|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127040853/http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1861/|archivedate=2014-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tablet coating===
{{see also|Film coating}}
Many tablets today are coated after being pressed. Although sugar-coating was popular in the past, the process has many drawbacks. Modern tablet coatings&lt;ref&gt;Gendre C., Genty M., César da Silva J., Tfayli A., Boiret M., Lecoq O., Baron M., Chaminade P., Péan J-M., Comprehensive study of dynamic curing effect on tablet coating structure, Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm., 81 (2012), 657-665&lt;/ref&gt; are [[polymer]] and [[polysaccharide]] based, with [[plasticizer]]s and [[pigment]]s included. Tablet coatings must be stable and strong enough to survive the handling of the tablet, must not make tablets stick together during the coating process, and must follow the fine contours of embossed characters or logos on tablets. Coatings are necessary for tablets that have an unpleasant taste, and a smoother finish makes large tablets easier to swallow. Tablet coatings are also useful to extend the shelf-life of components that are sensitive to moisture or oxidation. Special coatings (for example with pearlescent effects) can enhance brand recognition.

If the active ingredient of a tablet is sensitive to acid, or is irritant to the stomach lining, an [[enteric coating]] can be used, which is resistant to [[stomach]] acid, and dissolves in the less acidic area of the intestines. Enteric coatings are also used for medicines that can be negatively affected by taking a long time to reach the [[small intestine]], where they are absorbed. Coatings are often chosen to [[controlled release|control the rate of dissolution]] of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Some drugs are absorbed better in certain parts of the digestive system. If this part is the stomach, a coating is selected that dissolves quickly and easily in acid. If the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon, a coating is used that is acid resistant and dissolves slowly to ensure that the tablet reaches that point before dispersing.

There are two types of coating machines used in the pharmaceutical industry: coating pans and automatic coaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1806/ Coating machines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328095614/http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1806/ |date=2012-03-28 }}, apteka95.com&lt;/ref&gt; Coating pans are used mostly to sugar coat pellets. Automatic coaters are used for all kinds of coatings; they can be equipped with a remote control panel, a dehumidifier, and dust collectors. An explosion-proof design is required for applying coatings that contain alcohol.

===Pill-splitters===

It is sometimes necessary to split tablets into halves or quarters. Tablets are easier to break accurately if scored, but there are devices called [[Pill splitting|pill-splitters]] which cut unscored and scored tablets. Tablets with special coatings (for example enteric coatings or [[controlled release|controlled-release]] coatings) should not be broken before use, as this will expose the tablet core to the digestive juices, circumventing the intended delayed-release effect.

'''Tricentis Tosca''' is a [[software testing]] tool that is used to [[automated testing|automate end-to-end testing]] for [[software applications]]. It is developed by [[Tricentis]]. 

Tricentis Tosca combines multiple aspects of software testing (test case design, test automation, test data design and generation, and analytics) to test [[GUI]]s and [[API]]s from a business perspective.&lt;ref name="valuebased"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6328176/ Value-Based Coverage Measurement in Requirements-Based Testing: Lessons Learned from an Approach Implemented in the TOSCA Testsuite,  2012 38th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications ] by R. Ramler, T. Kopetzy, W. Platz, 2012 38th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications  October 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most frequently-noted technologies used in Tricentis Tosca are related to  [[Model-based testing]] and  [[Risk-based testing]].&lt;ref name="gartnermq"&gt;[https://www.gartner.com/doc/3512920/magic-quadrant-software-test-automation Magic Quadrant for Software Test Automation], Gartner, November 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forresterwave"&gt;[https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Modern+Application+Functional+Test+Automation+Tools+Q4+2016/-/E-RES123866 The Forrester Wave™: Modern Application Functional Test Automation Tools, Q4 2016], Gartner, December 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model-based testing==
Instead of using [[Scripting_language | scripting]] for [[test automation]], Tricentis Tosca applies a model-based testing approach and creates a model of the application under test. Technical details about the application under test, test case logic, and [[test data]] are saved separately and joined together at test execution time. When an element in the application under test changes, the technical details are updated once in the central model. Since the test cases inherit from this model, the various test cases that test the updated element do not need to be modified manually to reflect the change.&lt;ref name="valuebased"/&gt;

==Risk-based testing== 
Based on a risk assessment of the application under tests’s requirements, Tricentis Tosca uses [[Risk-based testing|risk-based test]] design to suggest the most effective test cases and identify the risk contribution of each test cases. It also uses a variety of methodologies (such as [[equivalence partitioning]], [[boundary testing]], and [[Combinatorics|combinatorial methods]] such as linear expansion) to try to minimize the number of test cases while increasing risk coverage. After the tests are executed, the tool aggregates risk coverage from business, technical, and compliance perspectives.&lt;ref name="combin"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6200154/ Combinatorial Test Design in the TOSCA Testsuite: Lessons Learned and Practical Implication], by R. Ramler, T. Kopetzy, W. Platz, 2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation  October 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biological classification]], especially [[zoology]], the '''type genus''' is the [[genus]] which defines a [[Family (biology)|biological family]] and the root of the family name.

== Zoological nomenclature ==
According to the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], "The name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon is a nominal genus called the 'type genus'; the family-group name is based upon that of the type genus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=63&amp;nfv= ICZN Code Art. 63. "Name-bearing types."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any family-group name must have a type genus (and any genus-group name must have a [[type species]], but any species-group name may, but need not, have one or more type specimens). The type genus for a family-group name is also the genus that provided the stem to which was added the ending -idae (for families).

:Example: The family name [[Cricetidae]] has as its type genus the genus ''[[Cricetus]]'' &lt;small&gt;Leske, 1779.&lt;/small&gt;

== Botanical nomenclature ==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], the phrase "type genus" is used, unofficially, as a term of convenience. In the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]]'' this phrase has no status. The code uses type specimens for ranks up to family, and types are optional for higher ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art10#10.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code does not refer to the genus containing that type as a "type genus".

:Example: "''[[Poa]]'' is the type genus of the family [[Poaceae]] and of the order [[Poales]]" is another way of saying that the names Poaceae and Poales are based on the generic name ''Poa''.

'''Urban planning''' is a technical and political process concerned with the development and [[design]] of [[land use]] and the built environment, including air, water, and the [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] passing into and out of [[urban area]]s, such as [[transportation]], [[communication]]s, and [[distribution network]]s&lt;ref name="WIUP"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is Urban Planning |publisher=School of Urban Planning, [[McGill University]] |url=https://mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/planning |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108061506/https://mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/planning |archive-date =8 January 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;and the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors.

It is closely related to the field of [[urban design]] and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning is also referred to as '''urban and regional planning''', '''regional planning''', '''town planning''', '''city planning''', '''rural planning''', '''urban development''' or some combination in various areas worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Watson, V., 2016. Shifting approaches to planning theory: global north and south. Urban Planning, 1(4), pp.32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Urban planning guides orderly development in urban, [[suburb]]an and [[rural area]]s. Although predominantly concerned with the planning of [[Human settlement|settlements]] and communities, urban planning is also responsible for the planning and development of [[water use]] and resources, rural and agricultural land, parks and conserving areas of natural environmental significance. [[Urban planner|Practitioners of urban planning]] are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[architecture]], urban design, [[public consultation]], policy recommendations, implementation and management.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Enforcement methodologies include governmental [[zoning]], [[planning permission]]s, and [[building code]]s,&lt;ref name="WIUP" /&gt; as well as private [[easements]] and [[restrictive covenant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Smit |first1=Anneke |last2=Valiante |first2=Marcia |year=2015 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Smit |editor1-first=Anneke |editor2-last=Valiante |editor2-first=Marcia |title=Public Interest, Private Property: Law and Planning Policy in Canada |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press]] |pages=1–36, page 10 |isbn=978-0-7748-2931-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture, [[landscape architecture]], [[civil engineering]], and [[public administration]] to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals. Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields. Today urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline. The discipline is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as [[land-use planning]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], [[environmental planning]], and [[transportation planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Planning? |publisher=American Planning Association |url=https://www.planning.org/aboutplanning/whatisplanning.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310195220/https://www.planning.org/aboutplanning/whatisplanning.htm |archive-date=10 March 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of urban planning|}}

There is evidence of urban planning and designed communities dating back to the [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations in the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BCE]].  Archeologists studying the ruins of cities in these areas find paved streets that were laid out at right angles in a grid pattern.&lt;ref name=Davreu1&gt;Davreu, Robert (1978). "Cities of Mystery: The Lost Empire of the Indus Valley". ''The World’s Last Mysteries''. (second edition). Sydney: Readers’ Digest. pp. 121-129. {{ISBN|0-909486-61-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it.  Beginning in the 8th century BCE, Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal (or grid-like) plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, Frank (1984). Die Stadt im Altertum. München: Verlag C.H. Beck. pp. 51-141: Morris, A.E.J. (1972). History of Urban Form. Prehistory to the Renaissance. London. pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], inspired by the Greeks, also used orthogonal plans for their cities.  City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience.  The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning.  As the Roman Empire declined, these ideas slowly disappeared.  However, many cities in Europe still held onto the planned Roman city center.  Cities in Europe from the 9th to 14th centuries, often grew organically and sometimes chaotically. But in the following centuries some newly created towns were built according to preconceived plans, and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/336940|title=The foundation, planning and building of new towns in the 13th and 14th centuries in Europe. An architectural-historical research into urban form and its creation.|last=Boerefijn|first=Wim|publisher=Phd. thesis Universiteit van Amsterdam|year=2010|isbn=978-90-9025157-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century on, much more is recorded of urban design and the people that were involved. In this period, theoretical treatises on architecture and urban planning start to appear in which theoretical questions are addressed and designs of towns and cities are described and depicted. During the Enlightenment period, several European rulers ambitiously attempted to redesign capital cities.  During the [[Second French Republic]], [[Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], under the direction of [[Napoleon III]], redesigned the city of [[Paris]] into a more modern capital, with long, straight, wide boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=David|title=Baron Haussmann and Modern Paris|journal=American Scholar|date=1992|volume=61|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century. The industrialized cities of the 19th century grew at a tremendous rate. The pace and style of this industrial construction was largely dictated by the concerns of private business. The evils of urban life for the [[working poor]] were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The [[laissez-faire]] style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the [[Victorian era]], was starting to give way to a [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]] that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the [[industrial age]], by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.

At the beginning of the 20th century, urban planning began to be recognized as a profession. The [[Town and Country Planning Association]] was founded in 1899 and the first academic course in Great Britain on urban planning was offered by the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. {{Britannica|619445|Urban planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the ideas of [[modernism]] and uniformity began to surface in urban planning, and lasted until the 1970s.  Many planners started to believe that the ideas of modernism in urban planning led to higher crime rates and social problems.&lt;ref name="Midgley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris |first=Eleanor Smith |display-authors=etal |year=1997 |title=British Town Planning and Urban Design: Principles and policies |location=[[Harlow]], Essex, Enngland |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=147–149 |isbn=978-0-582-23496-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planners now focus more on individualism and diversity in urban centers.

==Theories==
{{Further|Theories of urban planning|}}
Planning theory is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning&lt;ref&gt;Watson, V., 2016. Shifting approaches to planning theory: global north and south. Urban Planning, 1(4), pp.32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Whittmore |first=Andrew |date=2 February 2015 |title=How Planners Use Planning Theory |publisher=Planetizen | url = http://www.planetizen.com/node/73570/how-planners-use-planning-theory | accessdate =24 April 2015}} ''citing'' {{Cite journal|last=Whittemore |first=Andrew H. |year=2014 |title=Practitioners Theorize, Too Reaffirming Planning Theory in a Survey of Practitioners’ Theories |journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=76–85 |doi=10.1177/0739456X14563144}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
{{Further|Technical aspects of urban planning|}}

Technical aspects of urban planning involve the applying scientific, technical processes, considerations and features that are involved in planning for [[land use]], [[urban design]], [[natural resource|natural resources]], [[transport|transportation]], and [[infrastructure]]. Urban planning includes techniques such as: predicting [[population growth]], [[zoning]], geographic mapping and analysis, analyzing park space, surveying the [[water supply]], identifying transportation patterns, recognizing food supply demands, allocating healthcare and social services, and analyzing the impact of land use.

In order to predict how cities will develop and estimate the effects of their interventions, planners use various models. These models can be used to indicate relationships and patterns in demographic, geographic, and economic data. They might deal with short-term issues such as how people move through cities, or long-term issues such as land use and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John D. |last=Landis |year=2012 |chapter=Modeling Urban Systems| editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=323–350 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Building code]]s and other regulations dovetail with urban planning by governing how cities are constructed and used from the individual level.&lt;ref&gt;''Codes, rules, and standards are part of a matrix of relations that influence the practice of urban planning and design. These forms of regulation provide an important and inescapable framework for development, from the laying out of subdivisions to the control of stormwater runoff. The subject of regulations leads to the source of how communities are designed and constructed—defining how they can and can't be built—and how codes, rules, and standards continue to shape the physical space where we live and work.'' {{Cite book|last=Ben-Joseph |first=Eran |year=2012 |chapter=Codes and Standards in Urban Planning and Design | editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=352–370 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban planners==
{{Further|Urban planner|}}
An urban planner is a professional who works in the field of urban planning for the purpose of optimizing the effectiveness of a community's land use and infrastructure. They formulate plans for the development and management of urban and suburban areas, typically analyzing land use compatibility as well as economic, environmental and social trends. In developing any plan for a community (whether commercial, residential, agricultural, natural or recreational), urban planners must consider a wide array of issues including [[urban sustainability|sustainability]], existing and potential [[pollution]], [[transport]] including potential [[traffic congestion|congestion]], [[crime]], land values, economic development, social equity, [[zoning]] codes, and other legislation.

The importance of the urban planner is increasing in the 21st century, as modern society begins to face issues of increased population growth, climate change and unsustainable development. An urban planner could be considered a [[Green-collar worker|green collar]] professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamenetz |first1=Anya |title=Ten Best Green Jobs for the Next Decade |website=fastcompany |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1129671/ten-best-green-jobs-next-decade |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826065655/https://www.fastcompany.com/1129671/ten-best-green-jobs-next-decade |dead-url=yes |archivedate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers suggest that urban planners around the world work in different "[[planning cultures]]", adapted to their local cities and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Friedman |first=John |year=2012 |chapter=Varieties of Planning Experience: Toward a Globalized Planning Culture? | editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=87–98 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professionals have identified skills, abilities and basic knowledge sets that are common to urban planners across national and regional boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Institutes of Certified Planners Certification|url=https://www.planning.org/aicp/|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional standards|url=http://www.rtpi.org.uk/membership/professional-standards/|website=Royal Institute of Town Planners|publisher=Royal Town Planning Institute|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISOCARP|url=https://isocarp.org/about-isocarp/|publisher=International Society of City and Regional Planners|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
