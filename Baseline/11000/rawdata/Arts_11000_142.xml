'''''A Visit from the Old Mistress''''' is an 1876 painting by American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It was one of several works that Homer created during a mid-1870s visit to Virginia, where he had served as a war correspondent during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="VA Museum"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Peter |last2=Dalton |first2=Karen |year=1989 |title=Winslow Homer's images of Blacks: The Civil War and Reconstruction years |journal=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin|volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=3–4 |publisher=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have noted that the painting's composition is taken from Homer's earlier painting ''Prisoners from the Front,'' which depicts a group of captive Confederate soldiers defiantly regarding a Union officer.&lt;ref name="Calo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calo |first1=Mary Ann |year=1980 |title=Winslow Homer's Visits to Virginia during Reconstruction |journal=American Art Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=4–27 |publisher=Kennedy Galleries Inc. |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It, along with Homer's other paintings of black southern life from this period, have been praised as an "invaluable record of an important segment of life in Virginia during the Reconstruction."&lt;ref name="VA Museum"/&gt;

'''''An Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation''''' ({{lang-de|Versuch einer Critik&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kritik'' in [[modern German]].&lt;/ref&gt; aller Offenbarung}}; 1792) was the first published work by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]. It was briefly mistaken by the public to be a fourth Critique by [[Immanuel Kant]], and thereby gained Fichte much philosophical fame.

In this work, Fichte argued that any [[revelation]] in relation to [[God]] must be consistent with [[morality]], which was against many aspects of orthodox [[Christian]] belief at the time.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/fichtejg.htm Johann Gottlieb Fichte [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''António Manuel da Fonseca'''  (27 September 1796, [[Lisbon]] - 4 October 1890, Lisbon) was a Portuguese painter, illustrator and theatrical designer; best known for his mythological and historical scenes.

==Biography==
His first studies were with his father, {{ill|João Tomás da Fonseca|pt}}, who was a painter and sculptor.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.museuartecontemporanea.pt/pt/artistas/ver/154/artists Brief biography] @ the [[Chiado Museum]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then worked at the "Aula de Desenho e de Figura e História", founded by Joaquim Manuel da Rocha (1727-1786).

His first known work is a panel depicting King [[João VI]] and [[Carlota Joaquina of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]], executed in 1820 at the "Palácio das Laranjeiras" for Count {{ill|Joaquim Pedro Quintela|pt}} and his wife. Two years later, he produced a large series of [[fresco]]es at the  Palácio de Quintela;&lt;ref name="L"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iUYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA427&amp;lpg=PA427&amp;dq=ant%C3%B3nio+manuel+da+fonseca+pintor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q6zMs3N1Av&amp;sig=6nfSN_yuVWHVnu2P_wu0yW1MMXY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgKahUKEwiTjtPwtcrHAhWSWYgKHbKNCjA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Brief biography] from the notes to ''Obras, precedidas de um ensaio biographico, augmentadas com algumas composições ineditas do poeta pelo visconde de Juromenha'' @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly scenes from the [[Roman-Sabine wars]], landscapes showing Rome and its environs and miscellaneous themes from Greek mythology. In 1878, when he was in his 80s, he returned to do restorative work.

In 1825, he painted curtains for the [[Teatro Nacional de São Carlos]], followed by a portrait of King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]]. Supported by the King and Count Quintela, he was able to go to Rome, where he made copies of the [[Old Masters]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; and completed his artistic training with [[Vincenzo Camuccini]] and [[Andrea Pozzi]].&lt;ref name="L" /&gt; He also spent time in London and Paris and, when he returned in 1836, he was appointed a Professor of [[history painting]] at the "Academia de Belas-Artes" (now part of the [[University of Lisbon]]).&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GlUPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=ant%C3%B3nio+manuel+da+fonseca+pintor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sLA2qzN2UO&amp;sig=YKoq8WQUx04dWbqaX7z5LJC3zVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwCWoVChMI2_60_rTKxwIVxjSICh0B1gF_#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Biographical notes] from the ''Diccionario bibliographico portuguez'' @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, he designed costumes for a play by [[Almeida Garrett]]&lt;ref name="L" /&gt; and did set designs for the opera ''[[Robert le diable]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Together with the [[lithographer]],  Maurício José Sendim (1786-1870), he created illustrations for the ''Quadros históricos'' by [[António Feliciano de Castilho]].

He continued to exhibit frequently, culminating in 1880 at a major exhibition in the "Palácio de Cristal" in [[Porto]]. He also served as drawing master to the future King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos]] and his brother [[Afonso, Duke of Porto|Afonso]]. His many honors include Knighthood in the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] and the [[Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa]],&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; as well as being a corresponding member of the [[Institut de France]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">The '''Arts and Humanities Data Service''' ('''AHDS''') was a [[United Kingdom]] national service aiding the discovery, creation and preservation of digital resources in and for research, teaching and learning in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]]. It was established in 1996 and ceased operation in 2008 (although the website and related digital collections are still accessible).

Organised via a Managing Executive at [[King's College London]] and five AHDS Centres, hosted by various UK Higher Education Institutions, the AHDS was funded until the end of March 2008 by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC).  

However, in March 2007 the AHRC decided to cease funding for the AHDS beyond March 2008. As a result, the AHDS is now advising AHRC applicants to ensure their projects include a budget for the costs of preservation and sustainability (whether with the AHDS or another service).

Following the demise of AHDS, and the cessation of the [[Methods Network]], the [[Centre for e-Research (CeRch)]] was established at [[King's College London]] in 2008. The Centre's aims are to facilitate interdisciplinary, institutional, national and international collaboration.

The five subject-based AHDS Centres are:

*[[AHDS Archaeology]] — [[University of York]]
*[[AHDS History]] — [[University of Essex]]
*[[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] — [[Oxford University]]
*[[AHDS Performing Arts]] — [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute|HATII]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]
*[[AHDS Visual Arts]] — [[University for the Creative Arts]] (Farnham campus)

Specific areas of work that the Arts and Humanities Data Service covers include:

*[[digital preservation]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/ahds-preservation-documents.htm preservation handbooks] detailing specific preservation issues with various digital file formats and information on its [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/repository.htm digital repository]

'''Ayala Zacks-Abramov''' ({{lang-he|אילה זקס-אברמוב}}, 
1912 &amp;ndash; 30 August 2011) was an [[Israel]]i-[[Canadians|Canadian]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/canadas-peggy-guggenheim-ayala-zacksabramov-dies Canada's Peggy Guggenheim Ayala Zacks-Abramov Dies - ArtLyst]&lt;/ref&gt; [[art collector]]. Ayala was widowed three times, and was previously married to the Canadian art collector Samuel Jacob Zacks and to the knesset member [[Zalman Abramov]].

==Biography==
Zacks-Abramov was born in Jerusalem in 1912 as Ayala Ben-Tovim. Her parents, Shmuel Ben-Tovim and Rashe (née: Berman) were married in Jerusalem in 1902. She studied in London and in Paris where she met her first husband, Morris Fleg, whom she married in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], he joined the [[French Resistance]] after Fleg enlisted to the army and was killed during a military operation.

In 1947, she married Samuel Zacks, a Canadian economist and art collector, whom she met during her stay in [[Switzerland]]. After marrying, the couple began to collect art items from the 19th century and the 20th century, mainly of French, Canadian and Israeli artists such as [[Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Chagall]]. They also acquired art by Israeli artists such as [[Marcel Janco]], [[Mordechai Ardon]], [[Reuven Rubin]] and [[Anna Ticho]], and art of relatively unknown artists at the time of the purchase such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Yigal Tumarkin]] and [[Joseph Zaritsky]].

In 1970, her husband Zacks died. She returned to Israel in 1976 and married Zalman Abramov, who was a lawyer and a Knesset member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/1.1373523 מתה פטרונית האמנות אילה זקס אברמוב - גלריה - הארץ]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were [[Patronage|patrons of the arts]], and Abramov continued to support the art world even after her husband's death in 1997.

Zachs-Abramov supported over the years the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] and the [[Israel Museum]] and had a hand in their growth. Both the museums have halls named after her. She mentioned these museums in her will, in which she declared that her art collection would be divided between them.

The Israeli notable painter [[Joseph Zaritsky]] painted a well-known figurative portrait of her.

Many of the art works in Zachs-Abramov's possession were donated or loaned through to years to museums in Israel, France and Canada.

In 2000, the organization was recognized for a special preservation award by the Dance Heritage Coalition, as well as being recognized by the [[White House Millennium Council]], as part of "[[Save America's Treasures]]".&lt;ref name=greatness&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancing into greatness|work=[[Asbury Park Press]]|date=2000-08-20|author=Collins, Karyn D.|quote=Preservation awards went to the Katherine Dunham Center in East St. Louis, Il., Cross-Cultural Dance Resources  in Flagstaff, Ariz., and the Halla Huhm Foundation in Honolulu. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/Initiatives/Millennium/AndersonCottage_ListofGrants.html|publisher=[[National Archives]]|accessdate=2008-06-03|title=President Clinton announces FY2000 Save America's Treasures grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Founded in 1981, the CCDR's mission is to promote dance resources, preserve and research dance materials, and foster a dynamic environment for dance events. It provides consultation on [[dance theory]] and methods, [[ethnomusicology]], cultural dynamics and ethics.  The organization sponsors concerts and visiting artists and lectures.  CCDR also maintains a non lending library of over 15,000 shelved items, including artwork, audiovisual materials, books, clippings, monographs, periodicals, costumes, dolls, and musical instruments, as well as the archives of [[Gertrude Prokosch Kurath]], [[Eleanor King]], [[Joann Kealiinohomoku]] (in progress), and the [[Daniel J. Crowley]] musical instrument collection.

Since 1989, the organization's director is Joann Kealiinohomoku, known for her 1970 essay, "An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A forecast of dance's future|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=1989-07-02|author=Popper, Regina|quote=Joann Kealiinohomoku, a cultural anthropologist who directs Cross-Cultural Dance Resources in Flagstaff, Ariz., and who in 1970 wrote an essay titled ''An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Theory and methods for an anthropological study of dance", her 1976 doctoral dissertation.

The CCDR receives partial funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the Arizona Commission on the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CCDR Newsletter|url=http://www.ccdr.org/Newletters/issue23-2003-dec.pdf|date=December 2003|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a library which is open to the public Monday through Friday from 10-5, and by appointment.  It is also searchable online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdhs.org/resources/res-libraries.html |title=Online Resources: Libraries and research institutions |publisher=[[Society of Dance History Scholars]] |accessdate=2008-06-03 |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516234211/http://www.sdhs.org/resources/res-libraries.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it was announced that the CCDR's collections are being transferred to the [[Herberger College of the Arts]] at [[Arizona State University]], Dance Department. The organization's vice president, [[Elsie Ivancich Dunin]], made a gift to the College to provide for the collection's permanent care and [[Cultural heritage management|curation]].&lt;ref name=herberger&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herbergercollege.asu.edu/news/press_release.php?id=650|title=The Power of Place: Renowned collection comes to ASU Herberger College Dance with $1.15 million gift from international dance scholar |publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|format=press release|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, CCDR was recognized by  President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[White House Millennium Council]], "[[Save America's Treasures]]". The DHC was awarded a grant on behalf of three archives, one in Hawaii, one in Missouri and CCDR in Arizona.  CCDR received one third of  the grant, specifically for the preservation of the Gertrude Kurath, Eleanor King, and Kealiinohomoku Collections.&lt;ref name=greatness/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance notes|work=[[Star-Ledger]]|date=2000-08-09|author=Johnson, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dégustation automnale.jpg|thumb|A selection of dégustation dishes and wines]]
'''Dégustation''' is the careful, appreciative tasting of various foods, focusing on the [[gustatory system]], the [[senses]], high culinary art and good company.  Dégustation is more likely to involve sampling small portions of all of a chef's [[signature dish]]es in one sitting. Usually consisting of eight or more courses, it may be accompanied by a matching [[wine degustation]] which complements each dish.

==History and etymology==
The [[French language|French]] term ''dégustation'' is still commonly used in English-language contexts.  Modern dégustation probably comes from the [[French cuisine|French]] kitchens of the early 20th century and is different from earlier meals with many courses because these meals were served as full-sized meals at each course.

==Examples==
Sampling a selection of [[cheese]]s, at home or in a [[restaurant]], may also be called a dégustation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wells |first=Patricia |date=June 10, 1984 |title=A Cheese Lover's Tour of France |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/10/travel/a-cheese-lover-s-tour-of-france.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three to four varieties are normally chosen, generally including a semi-soft cheese, a [[goat's cheese]], and a [[blue cheese]]. The stronger varieties are normally tasted last.

A six course dégustation may include two seafood, red meat and dessert items with matching wines while the same menu could have added a vegetarian item, and any other types of dish to expand the menu to (for example) a nine-course dégustation menu.

The popular Spanish style of [[tapas]] is similar to the dégustation style, but is not in itself a complete [[Table d'hôte|set menu]] offering the chefs' signature dishes, but instead offers a variety from which the diner can choose.

'''Design methods''' are procedures, techniques, aids, or tools for designing. They offer a number of different kinds of activities that the designer might use within an overall design process. Conventional procedures of design, such as drawing, can be regarded as design methods, but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together under the name of 'Design Methods’. What these new methods have in common is that they "are attempts to make public the hitherto private thinking of designers; to externalise the design process".&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=J. Christopher |title=Design Methods |date=1980 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Design methodology'' is the broader study of method in design: the study of the principles, practices and procedures of designing.&lt;ref name="Cross Methodology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Developments in Design Methodology |date=1984 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK |isbn=0471102482}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==
Social, political and economic developments of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century put into motion modern benefits and constraints for living and working. Industrial and technological breakthroughs associated with this period created social and economic complexities for people and their environment. Disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, engineering and product development began to tackle new types of problem-solving past traditional artifact making. More informed and methodical approaches to designing were required.

From 1958 to 1963 [[Horst Rittel]] was a pioneer in articulating the relationship between science and design, specifically the limitations of design processes based on the 19th century rational view of science, in his courses at [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name=Ulm1&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ ''Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2&gt;Lindinger, H., (1991), ''Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects'', Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel proposed principles for dealing with these limitations through his seminal HfG design methods courses: [[cybernetics]], [[operational analysis]] and [[communication theory]].&lt;ref name=Ulm1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rit1&gt;Rith, C and Dubberly, H, 'Why Horst W J Rittel Matters', Design Issues, Vol 23, No 1, pp. 72-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he was recruited to Berkeley to teach design methods courses and helped found the Design Methods Group (DMG) and the DMG Journal.&lt;ref name=Rit1 /&gt;

Design methods in England originally drew from a 1962 conference&lt;ref&gt;John Christopher Jones and Denis Thornley (eds). The Conference on Design Methods: papers presented at the conference on systematic and intuitive methods in engineering, industrial design, architecture and communications, London, September 1962, Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; called "The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and [[Communication studies|Communications]]." This event was organized by [[John Christopher Jones|John Chris Jones]], and Peter Slann who, with conference invitees, were driven by concerns about how their modern industrialized world was being manifested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/dmconference1962.html 1962 conference participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference participants countered the craftsman model of design which was rooted in turning raw materials through tried and true craft-based knowledge into finished products. They believed that a single craft-based designer producing design solutions was not compatible with addressing the evolving complexity of post-industrial societies. They stressed that designers needed to work in cross-disciplinary teams where each participant brings his/her specific body of skills, language and experiences to defining and solving problems in whatever context.

The &lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/theory_of_designing.html John Chris Jones lists key design questions]&lt;/ref&gt; key benefit was to find a method that suits a particular design situation. [[Christopher Alexander]] went on to write his seminal books ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' and ''[[A Timeless Way of Building]]''.

=== Emergence of design research and design studies ===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, graduates of the [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name="Ulm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulm2"/&gt; began to spread Horst Rittel's approach of design methodology across Europe and the United States in context of their professional work and teaching what became known as the 'Ulm Model'.&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;

Likewise, after the 1962 conference in England, many of the participants began to publish and to define an area of research that focused on design. Three "camps" seemed to emerge to develop different directions in the initial work in Design Methods:

:* Behaviorism interpreted Design Methods as a way to describe [[human behavior]] in relation to the built environment. Its clinical approach tended to rely on human behavior processes ([[Categorization|taxonomic]] activities).
:* Reductivism broke Design Methods down into small constituent parts. This scientific approach tended to rely on rationalism and objectified processes such as [[epistemological]] activities.
:* Phenomenology approached design methods from an experiential approach (human experience and [[perception]].)

The [[Design Research Society]] was founded in 1966 by several participants from the Conference on Design Methods. The purpose of the Society is  to promote "the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields" and is an interdisciplinary group with many professions represented, but all bound by the conviction of the benefits of [[design research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/early_days1.0.html John Chris Jones thoughts on design research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Design Research Association]] is one of the best-known entities that strive to integrate designers and [[social science]] professionals for better built environments. EDRA was founded by Henry Sanoff in 1969. Both [[John Chris Jones]] and [[Christopher Alexander]] interacted with EDRA and other camps; both seemed at a certain point to reject their interpretations. Jones and Alexander also questioned their original theses about design methods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

An interesting shift that affected design methods and design studies was a series of 1968 lectures by [[Herbert A. Simon]], the Nobel laureate, on "The Sciences of the Artificial".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1969) ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed using [[scientific methods]] to explore the world of man-made things (hence artificial). He discussed the role of [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] ([[observation]]) and [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] (making) as a process of creating man-made responses to the world he/she interacted with. Important to Simon's contribution were his notions of "[[bounded rationality]]" and "[[satisficing]]." Simon's concept had a profound impact on the discourse in both design methods, and the newly emerging design studies communities in two ways. It provided an entry to using scientific ideas to overlay on design, and it also created an internal debate whether design could/should be expressed and practiced as a type of [[science]] with the reduction of emphasis on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

[[Nigel Cross]] has been prolific in articulating the issues of design methods and design research. The discussion of the ongoing debate of what is design research and design science was, and continues to be articulated by Cross. His thesis is that design is not a science, but is an area that is searching for "intellectual independence." He views the original design methods discussions of the 1960s as a way to integrate objective and rational methods in practicing design. Scientific method was borrowed as one framework, and the term [[design science]] was coined in 1966 at the conference on The Design Method focusing on a systematic approach to practicing design.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S. A (1966), Design Science. In S. A Gregory (ed.) The Design Method. London, Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross defined the "science of design" as a way to create a body of work to improve the understanding of design methods&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1993) 'A History of Design Methodology', in M. de Vries, N. Cross and D. Grant (eds.), ''Design Methodology and Relationships with Science'', Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; — and more importantly that design does not need to be a binary choice between [[science]] and [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1982) 'Designerly Ways of Knowing', ''Design Studies'', '''3''', 221-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigan Bayazit published an overview of the historical development of design methods. She stated that "Design methods people were looking at rational methods of incorporating scientific techniques and knowledge into the design process to make rational decisions to adapt to the prevailing values, something that was not always easy to achieve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/074793604772933739 Bayazit, Nigan. "Investigating Design: A Review of Forty Years of Design Research."] Design Issues: Vol 20, No 1. Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional design practice===
Conversations about design methods and a more systematic approach to design was not isolated to Europe. America was also a magnet for practicing design professionals to codify their successes in design practice and backing into larger theories about the dynamics of design methods.

American designers were much more pragmatic at articulating design methods and creating an underlying language about the practice of industrial and graphic design. They were tied to economic systems that supported design practice and therefore focused on the way design could be managed as an extension of business, rather than the European approach to design methods based on transforming engineering by design.

Industrial design was the first area that made inroads into systematizing [[knowledge]] through practice. [[Raymond Loewy]] was instrumental at elevating the visibility of industrial design through cult of personality (appearing three times on front cover of ''Time Magazine''). [[Henry Dreyfuss]] had a profound impact on the practice of industrial design by developing a systematic process used to shape environments, [[transportation]], [[Product (business)|products]] and [[packaging]]. His focus on the needs of the average consumer was most celebrated in his book ''Designing for People'', an extensive exploration of [[ergonomics]].

[[Jay Doblin]] one of America's foremost industrial designers, worked for Raymond Loewy and was later an employee of [[Unimark International]], the world’s largest global design firm during the 1960s with offices in seven countries. In 1972, Doblin formed Chicago-based Jay Doblin &amp; Associates, a firm which managed innovative programs for Xerox Corporation and General Electric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin AIGA Overview of Jay Doblin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103135028/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin |date=2005-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doblin was prolific at developing a language to describe design. One of his best articles was "A Short, Grandiose Theory of Design", published in the 1987 Society of Typographic Arts Design Journal. In seven pages, Doblin presents a straightforward and persuasive argument for design as a systematic process. He described the emerging landscape of systematic design:

:* For large complex projects, it "would be irresponsible to attempt them without analytical methods" and rallied against an "adolescent reliance on overly intuitive practices."
:* He separated "direct design" in which a craftsperson works on the artifact to "indirect design" in which a design first creates a representation of the artifact, separating design from production in more complex situations.

Doblin and others were responding to the increased [[Inheritance (computer science)|specialization]] of design and the complexity of managing large design programs for corporations. It was a natural process to begin to discuss how design should move upstream to be involved with the specifications of problems, not only in the traditional mode of production which design had been practiced. Particularly since 2000, design methods and its intersection with business development have been visibly championed by numerous consultancies within design industry.

The continuity of approaches to design projects by such representative firms is the generation of inputs incited by the human condition in varied contexts. These approaches utilize a sustainable methods-based mode of making that takes into account critical analytic and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] skills toward more informed and inspired specifications grounded in:

:* Direct investigation of human circumstances to draw out impressions
:* Engagement by client-side and end-user participants in design process
:* Open articulation by practitioners of multiple disciplines facilitated by design

====Significance of role of professional design practice====
Practitioners approached design methods from a different angle than John Christopher Jones and the group of engineers and designers who convened in 1962. Many practitioners, through actual design opportunities, began to confront the complexities of the market and clients. They began to address issues of specifications, [[wiktionary:user|users]], distribution and [[innovation]]. Since there were no established methods, each practitioner began to develop frameworks and languages to describe a new way to design. Like any market-based model, there were many competing ideas about these new methods and their basis. Many of these designers may have been aware of the design methods movement, but many were not. Yet all their ideas were aligned to many of the basic tenets of the 1962 conference which advocated a more rigorous way of doing design. However, the social perspectives and criticisms of mediocre products of 1962 participants may not have been shared or agreed with.

==Current state of design methods==
There is no one way to practice design methods. John Chris Jones recognized this by stating:

:"Methodology should not be a fixed track to a fixed destination, but a conversation about everything that could be made to happen. The language of the conversation must bridge the logical gap between past and future, but in doing so it should not limit the variety of possible futures that are discussed nor should it force the choice  of a future that is unfree."&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"/&gt;

The focus of most post-1962 enhancements to design methods has been on developing a series of relevant, sound, humanistic problem-solving procedures and techniques to reduce avoidable errors and oversights that can adversely affect design solutions. The key benefit is to find a method that suits a particular design situation.

The benefits of their original work has been abstracted many times over; but in today's design environment, several of their main ideas have been integrated into contemporary design methods:
:* Emphasis on the user
:* Use of basic research methods to validate convictions with fact
:* Use of [[brainstorming]] and other related means to break mental patterns and precedent
:* Increased [[collaboration|collaborative]] nature of design with other disciplines

A large challenge for design as a discipline, its use of methods and an endeavor to create shared values, is its inherent synthetic nature as an area of study and action. This allows design to be extremely malleable in nature, borrowing ideas and concepts from a wide variety of professions to  suit the ends of individual practitioners. It also makes design vulnerable since these very activities make design a discipline unextensible as a shared body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/designmethodsforeveryone.html John Chris Jones perspective about "Design Methods for Everyone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Donald Schon]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published ''The Reflective Practitioner''.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, Donald A. The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.  1983. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-06878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw traditional professions with stable knowledge bases, such as [[law]] and [[medicine]], becoming unstable due to outdated notions of 'technical-rationality' as the grounding of professional knowledge. Practitioners were able to describe how they 'think on their feet', and how they make use of a standard set of frameworks and techniques. Schon foresaw the increasing instability of traditional knowledge and how to achieve it. This is in line with the original founders of design methods who wanted to break with an unimaginative and static technical society and unify [[exploration]], [[collaboration]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

Design methods has influenced design practice and [[design education]]. It has benefited the design community by helping to create introductions that would never have happened if traditional professions remained ''stable'', which did not necessarily allow collaboration due to gate keeping of areas of knowledge and [[expertise]]. Design has been by nature an interloper activity, with individuals that have crossed disciplines to question and innovate.

The challenge is to transform individual [[experiences]], frameworks and [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] into a shared, understandable, and, most importantly, a transmittable area of knowledge. Victor Margolin {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} states three reasons why this will prove difficult:

:* Domain knowledge is a mixture of [[vocation]] (discipline) and avocation (interest) creating hybrid definitions that degrade shared knowledge
:* [[Intellectual capital]] of design and wider scholarly pluralism has diluted focus and shared language which has led to ungovernable [[laissez-faire]] values
:* Individual explorations of design discourse focuses too much on individual narratives leading to personal point of view rather than a critical mass of shared values

In the end, ''design methods'' is a term that is widely used. Though conducive to interpretations, it is a shared belief in an exploratory and rigorous method to solve problems through design, an act which is part and parcel of what designers aim to accomplish in today's complex world.

[[File:Scribus-1.3-Linux.png|300px|thumb|[[Scribus]], an [[Open-source software|open source]] desktop publishing application]]

'''Desktop publishing''' (abbreviated '''DTP''') is the creation of documents using [[page layout]] skills on a personal ("desktop") [[personal computer|computer]] primarily for print. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional [[typography]] and [[printing]]. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for [[typography|digital typography]]. When used skillfully, desktop publishing allows the user to produce a wide variety of materials, from [[menu]]s to magazines and books, without the expense of commercial printing.

Desktop publishing combines a [[personal computer]] and [[WYSIWYG]] page layout [[software]] to create [[publication]] [[document]]s on a computer for either [[Publishing|large scale publishing]] or small scale local [[Multifunction printer|multifunction peripheral]] output and distribution. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than [[word processing]]. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.

The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for [[point of sale display]]s, [[promotional item]]s, [[Trade fair|trade show exhibits]], [[packaging|retail package designs]] and [[Out-of-home advertising|outdoor signs]]. Although what is classified as "DTP software" is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP skills aren't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for [[electronic media]]. The job descriptions that include "DTP", such as [[DTP artist]], often require skills using software for producing [[e-book]]s, web content, and [[web page]]s, which may involve [[web design]] or [[user interface design]] for any [[graphical user interface]].

== History ==

Desktop publishing was first developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winograd|first1=Terry|title=Bringing Design to Software|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201854916|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/2p-star.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Steve|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|date=2002|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0761923824|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contradictory claim states that desktop publishing began in 1983 with a program developed by [[James Davise]] at a community newspaper in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;"What You See Is Pretty Close to What You Get: New h&amp;j, pagination program for IBM PC, " Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, 13(10), February 13, 1984, pp. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The program Type Processor One ran on a [[Personal computer|PC]] using a [[graphics card]] for a [[WYSIWYG]] display and was offered commercially by Best info in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"Type-X '85: Fulfilling the Promise of the PC, " Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, 15(2) pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; (Desktop ''[[typesetting]]'' with only limited page makeup facilities had arrived in 1978–9 with the introduction of [[TeX]], and was extended in the early 1980s by [[LaTeX]].) The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] printer, and later in July with the introduction of [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] software from [[Aldus Corporation|Aldus]], which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software. Later on, PageMaker overtook [[Microsoft Word]] in professional DTP in 1985. The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to Aldus founder [[Paul Brainerd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/documents/index.html#note1 |title=The Stafford papers |first=Paul |last=Stiff |date=13 September 2006 |work=The optimism of modernity: recovering modern reasoning in typography |accessdate=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought a marketing catch-phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this suite of products, in contrast to the expensive commercial [[phototypesetting]] equipment of the day.

Before the advent of desktop publishing, the only option available to most people for producing typed documents (as opposed to handwritten documents) was a [[typewriter]], which offered only a handful of typefaces (usually fixed-width) and one or two font sizes.  Indeed, one popular desktop publishing book was entitled ''The Mac is not a typewriter'', and it had to actually explain how a Mac could do so much more than a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams, ''The Mac is not a typewriter: A style manual for creating professional-level type on your Macintosh'' (Berkeley: Peachpit Press, 1990), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to create [[WYSIWYG]] page layouts on screen and then [[printing|print]] pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300 [[dots per inch|dpi]] resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry; newspapers and other print publications made the move to DTP-based programs from older layout systems such as [[Atex (software)|Atex]] and other programs in the early 1980s.  

Early 1980s desktop publishing was a primitive affair. Users of the PageMaker-LaserWriter-Macintosh 512K system endured frequent software crashes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%2Baldus+%22pagemaker%22+infoworld+review+1987#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=MacIntosh Layout Package Remarkably Fast, Powerful | date=8 June 1987 | accessdate=2011-04-15 | last=Thompson | first=Keith | journal=InfoWorld | volume=9 | issue=23 | pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; cramped display on the Mac's tiny 512 x 342 1-bit [[monochrome]] screen, the inability to control [[letter-spacing]], [[kerning]],&lt;ref&gt;the addition or removal of space between individual characters in a piece of typeset text to improve its appearance or alter its fit&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[typography|typographic features]], and discrepancies between the screen display and printed output. However, it was a revolutionary combination at the time, and was received with considerable acclaim.

Behind-the-scenes technologies developed by [[Adobe Systems]] set the foundation for professional desktop publishing applications. The LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus printers included high quality, scalable Adobe [[PostScript]] fonts built into their [[Read-only memory|ROM]] memory. The LaserWriter's PostScript capability allowed publication designers to proof files on a local printer, then print the same file at DTP [[service bureau]]s using [[optics|optical resolution]] 600+ ppi PostScript printers such as those from [[Linotronic]]. Later, the [[Macintosh II]] was released which was much more suitable for desktop publishing because of its greater expandability, support for large color [[multi-monitor]] displays, and its [[SCSI]] storage interface which allowed fast high-capacity hard drives to be attached to the system. Macintosh-based systems continued to dominate the market into 1986, when the [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]-based [[Ventura Publisher]] was introduced for [[MS-DOS]] computers. PageMaker's pasteboard metaphor closely simulated the process of creating layouts manually, but Ventura Publisher automated the layout process through its use of tags and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]] and automatically generated indices and other body matter. This made it suitable for manuals and other long-format documents.

Desktop publishing moved into the home market in 1986 with [[Professional Page]] for the [[Amiga]], [[PageStream|Publishing Partner]] (now PageStream) for the [[Atari ST]], GST's [[Timeworks Publisher]] on the PC and Atari ST, and [[Calamus (DTP)|Calamus]] for the [[Atari TT030]]. Software was published even for 8-bit computers like the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]]: Home Publisher, [[The Newsroom (software)|The Newsroom]], and [[geoPublish]]. During its early years, desktop publishing acquired a bad reputation as a result of untrained users who created poorly organized, unprofessional-looking "[[ransom note effect]]" layouts; similar criticism was leveled again against early [[World Wide Web]] publishers a decade later.  However, some desktop publishers who mastered the programs were able to realize truly professional results. Desktop publishing skills were considered of primary importance in career advancement in the 1980s, but increased accessibility to more user-friendly DTP software has made DTP a secondary skill to [[art direction]], [[graphic design]], [[multimedia]] development, [[marketing communications]], and [[Administration (business)|administrative careers]].  DTP skill levels range from what may be learned in a few hours (e.g., learning how to put clip art in a word processor) to what requires a college education.  The discipline of DTP skills range from technical skills such as [[prepress]] production and programming to creative skills such as [[communication design]] and [[graphic image development]].

{{asof|2014}} Apple computers remain dominant in publishing, even as the most popular software has changed from [[QuarkXPress]] (an estimated 95% market share in the 1990s) to [[Adobe InDesign]]. An [[Ars Technica]] writer claimed that year that "I've heard about Windows-based publishing environments, but I've never actually seen one in my 20+ years in design and publishing".&lt;ref name="girard20140113"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/quarkxpress-the-demise-of-a-design-desk-darling/ |title=How QuarkXPress became a mere afterthought in publishing |last=Girard |first=Dave |date=2014-01-13 |work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are two types of pages in desktop publishing, [[electronic page]]s and virtual paper pages to be printed on [[Page (paper)|physical paper pages]]. All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by [[computer memory]] or [[computer data storage]] space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be [[printing|printed]], and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with [[paper size|international standard physical paper sizes]] such as "A4, " "letter, " etc., if not custom sizes for trimming. Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in [[poster]]s, [[billboard]]s and [[trade show displays]]. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in [[WYSIWYG]] format. Each page for printing has trim sizes (edge of paper) and a printable area if [[bleed (printing)|bleed printing]] is not possible as is the case with most [[desktop printer]]s. A [[web page]] is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the [[content (media and publishing)|content]] to scale in size with the page or causing the [[reflow document|content to re-flow]].

Master pages are templates used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. Master pages can also be used to apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering. [[Cascading Style Sheets]] can provide the same global formatting functions for web pages that master pages provide for virtual paper pages. [[Page layout]] is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include [[wikt:text|text]], linked [[image]]s that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be [[typing|keyed]] into the layout, placed, or (with [[database publishing]] applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.
[[Graphic design]] styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements. [[Typography]] styles may be applied to text automatically with [[stylé sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]]. Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called "wraparound" or "runaround. "

== Comparisons ==

=== With word processing ===

As desktop publishing software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing, modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications, blurring the line between [[word processing]] and desktop publishing. In the early days of [[graphical user interface]]s in the early 1980s, DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time.  Programs such as [[WordPerfect]] and [[WordStar]] were still mainly text-based and offered little in the way of page layout, other than perhaps margins and line spacing.  On the other hand, word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell checking, features that are common in many applications today. As computers and operating systems have become more powerful, versatile and user-friendly in the 2010s, vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet almost all their publication needs.

=== With other electronic layout software ===

In 2010-era usage, DTP does not usually include digital tools such as [[TeX]] or [[troff]], though both can easily be used on a modern desktop system and are standard with many [[Unix-like]] operating systems and readily available for other systems. The key difference between electronic [[typesetting]] software and DTP software is that DTP software is generally interactive and "What you see [onscreen] is what you get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) in design, while other electronic typesetting software, such as [[TeX]], [[LaTeX]] and other variants, tend to operate in "[[batch mode]]", requiring the user to enter the processing program's [[markup language]] (e.g. [[HTML]]) without immediate visualization of the finished product.  This kind of workflow is less user-friendly than WYSIWYG, but more suitable for conference proceedings and scholarly articles as well as corporate newsletters or other applications where consistent, automated layout is important.  In the 2010s, {{when|date=June 2014}} interactive front-end components of [[TeX]], such as [[TeXworks]] or [[LyX]] have produced "what you see is what you mean" ([[WYSIWYM]]) hybrids of DTP and batch processing. These hybrids are focused more on [[semantics]] than traditional DTP. There is some overlap between desktop publishing and what is known as [[hypermedia]] publishing (e.g. [[web design]], kiosk, [[CD-ROM]]).  Many graphical [[HTML editors]] such as [[Microsoft FrontPage]] and [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] use a layout engine similar to a DTP program. However, many web designers still prefer to write HTML without the assistance of a WYSIWYG editor, for greater control and ability to fine-tune the appearance and functionality. Another reason that some Web designers write in HTML is that WYSIWYG editors often result in excessive lines of code, leading to [[code bloat]] that can make the pages hard to [[troubleshoot]].

=== With web design ===

Desktop publishing produces primarily static print or [[electronic media]], the focus of this article.  Similar skills, processes, and terminology are used in [[web design]].  Digital typography is the specialization of [[typography]] for desktop publishing. [[Web typography]] addresses typography and the use of fonts on the [[World Wide Web]].  [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|Desktop style sheets]] apply formatting for print, web [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) provide format control for web display. Web  [[font family (HTML)|HTML font families]] map [[website]] font usage to the [[computer font|fonts]] available on the user [[web browser]] or display device.

[[File:Dublin Streets a Vendor of Books 1889.jpeg|460px|thumb|''Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Book'', [[Walter Osborne]], Oil on canvas, 80 x 90 cm, 1889. [[National Gallery of Ireland]]]]
'''''Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books'''''  is a 80 x 90 cm oil on canvas painting by the Irish artist [[Walter Osborne]], completed in 1889 and housed in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. It is one of a series of paintings Osborne made at the time emphasising the plight and hardships of Dublin's poor.

==Description==
[[File:Dublin Streets a Vendor of Books 1889 (detail).jpg|thumb|480px|left|Detail]]
The painting shows a bookseller's [[Hawker (trade)|stall]], set up on [[Eden Quay]], looking eastwards towards [[O'Connell Bridge]] with a hazy [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] view of [[James Gandon]]’s [[Custom house]].&lt;ref name="bl80"&gt;Bhreathnach-Lynch (2016), 80&lt;/ref&gt; A mother leaning against the wall holds a child in her arms. She looks tired and anxious, and appears to be connected with the young barefoot girl who approaches the bookseller's customers, offering [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]] for sale.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://onlinecollection.nationalgallery.ie/view/objects/asitem/search@/0?t:state:flow=bf169169-b3fb-4d0f-90ad-73a1fa1ab4c3 Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books, 1889]". [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. Retrieved 20 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; That they have been unsuccessful attracting buyers is indicated by the basket full of flowers on the ground by the woman.&lt;ref name="bl80" /&gt; 

[[File:Dublin Streets a Vendor of Books 1889 (detail 2).jpg|thumb|480px|Detail]]

Other details in the bustling scene include traffic (horses, carts and pedestrians) passing over O'Connell Bridge, and a [[barge]] and [[skiff]] just coming into view as they travel up the [[River Liffey]]. To the right of the main figures are a number of horse-drawn carts awaiting fares. A number of men wearing [[kilt]]s gather at a corner.

==Series==
The painting is one of a series of paintings of Dublin street scenes the artist completed around the time,&lt;ref name="bl80" /&gt; during visits home from his residence in England. They were later exhibited as a group at the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/9593x1014 The Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books]". [[Royal Irish Academy]]. Retrieved 20 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Complete Dictionary of Contributors and their Work from its Foundation in 1769 to 1904, Volume 6". [[The Royal Academy of Arts]]. H. Graves, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; The series was completed in oils in his studio, using detailed pencil sketches, and also on photographs, a modern approach for a painter at the time. Like the other works in the series, ''Dublin Streets'' is documentary in subject matter, influenced in part by the French [[Naturalism (visual art)|Naturalist]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] painters.&lt;ref name="bl80" /&gt; 

==Reception==
Although highly regarded today, these documentary, street paintings depicting everyday life were not commercially successful, and Osborne supplemented his income through portrait paintings, which were not as artistically satisfying. However, it remains an invaluable faithful record the quay in 1889; O'Connell bridge had just been rebuilt, while the view of Custom's house was overshadowed in 1891 by the [[Loopline Bridge|Loopline Viaduct]].

'''Essentialism''' is the view that every [[entity]] has a set of attributes that are necessary to its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|year=1968|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626|jstor=2024315|doi=10.2307/2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Western thought [[Platonic idealism|Plato's idealism]] held that all things have such an "essence"—an [[Theory of Forms|"idea" or "form"]]. In [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a [[Substance theory|substance]] that, as [[George Lakoff]] put it "make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not ''that'' kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Janicki|2003|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary view—[[non-essentialism]]—denies the need to posit such an "essence'".

Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides Dialogue]]'', depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the "existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt" .&lt;ref name="platostanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/|title=Plato's Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] at least until the time of [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ereshefsky|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hull|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[gender studies]] the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Women and Men|publisher=Basic Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0465047925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"&gt;Suzanne Kelly, Gowri Parameswaran, and Nancy Schniedewind, ''Women: Images &amp; Realities: A Multicultural Anthology'', 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
An ''[[essence]]'' characterizes a [[substance theory|substance]] or a [[Substantial form|form]], in the sense of the forms and ideas in [[Platonic idealism]]. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical [[humanism]] has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable [[human nature]]. This has been criticized by [[Kierkegaard]], [[Marx]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], and many other [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] thinkers.

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy (in particular, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[Philebus]]''), things were said to come into being by the action of a [[demiurge]] who works to form [[substance theory|chaos]] into ordered entities. Many definitions of ''essence'' hark back to the ancient Greek [[hylomorphic]] understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires ''hyle'' (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (''morphe''). Aristotle was the first to use the terms ''hyle'' and ''morphe''. According to [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|his explanation]], all entities have two aspects: "matter" and "form". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its [[quiddity]] or "whatness" (i.e., its "what it is").

Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an [[abstract entity]] of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some ''idea'' in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Plato's parable of the cave]].)

[[Karl Popper]] splits the ambiguous term ''[[Philosophical realism|realism]]'' into ''essentialism'' and ''realism''. He uses ''essentialism'' whenever he means the opposite of [[nominalism]], and ''realism'' only as opposed to [[idealism]]. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like "a puppy is a young dog" should be read from right to left, as an answer to "What shall we call a young dog"; never from left to right as an answer to "What is a puppy?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical essentialism===
Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of ''essence''. Unlike [[existentialism]], which posits "being" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist [[wikt:ontology|ontology]] must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

[[Plato]] believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the "essential" or ideal and the "perceived". [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.) applied the term ''essence'' to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, ''rationality'' is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, [[Bertrand Russell]] said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's "essence" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the ''name'' for it.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of essence was "hopelessly muddled" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

The Egyptian-born philosopher [[Plotinus]] (204–270 CE) brought [[idealism]] to the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Neoplatonism]], and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a "primary essence" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

Despite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, [[aesthetics]], [[heuristics]], [[psychology]], and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate [[Diana Fuss]], who wrote: "Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fuss|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas "ultimate reality" is held to be absolute essence.

Among contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is ''the power to exist'', which defines their "uncreated" Essence.&lt;ref&gt;Levina, Tatiana (Moscow 2013) Realism in Metaphysics: Analytic Questions and Continental Answers (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In 2010, an article by [[Gerald B. Folland]] in the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' stated, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define [[Lie algebra]] as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901121p.pdf Gerald B. Folland, October 2010, Notices of the AMS, p. 1121 "Speaking with the Natives: Reﬂections on Mathematical Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs bild.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] attempts to explain why people will pay more in an auction for the clothing of celebrities if the clothing is unwashed. He believes the answer to this and many other questions is that people cannot help but think of objects as containing a sort of "essence" that can be influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html Paul Bloom, July 2011 Ted talk, "The Origins of Pleasure"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|title=Conceptes and conceptual structure|journal=American Psychologist|year=1989|volume=44|issue=12|pages=1469–1481|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.12.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is [[Susan Gelman]], who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gelman, S. ''The essential child: Origins of essentialism in everyday thought''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toosi|first=N. R.|author2=Ambady, N.|title=Ratings of essentialism for eight religious identities|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.532441|pmid=21572550|pmc=3093246}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Toosi &amp; Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dar-Nimrod|first=I.|author2=Heine, S. J.|title=Genetic essentialism: On the deceptive determinism of DNA|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2011|volume=137|issue=5|pages=800–818|doi=10.1037/a0021860|pmid=21142350|pmc=3394457}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011).

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=S. A.|author2=Kremer, K. E.|title=Understanding natural causes: Children's explanations of how objects and their properties originate|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=2|pages=396–414|doi=10.2307/1131012|pmid=2055130|jstor=1131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rangel|first=U.|author2=Keller, J.|title=Essentialism goes social: Belief in social determinism as a component of psychological essentialism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1056–1078|doi=10.1037/a0022401|pmid=21319911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rangel and Keller, 2011).
Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in [[cognitive development]]. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demoulin|first=Stéphanie|last2=Leyens |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent|title=Lay Theories of Essentialism |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–42|doi=10.1177/1368430206059856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Demoulin, Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 2006).

There are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio &amp; Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanovsky|first=M.|title=Essentialism and folksociology: Ethnicity again|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=241–281|doi=10.1163/156853707X208503|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.7247}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtz|first=P.|author2=Wagner, W.|title=Essentialism and attribution of monstrosity in racist discourse: Right-wing internet postings about africans and jews|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=411–425|doi=10.1002/casp.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Holtz &amp; Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=D.|author2=Deeb, I. |author3=Segall, G. |author4=Ben-Eliyahu, A. |author5=Diesendruck, G. |title=The development of social essentialism: The case of Israeli children's inferences about Jews and Arabs |journal=Child Development |year=2010 |volume=81|issue=3|pages=757–777|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624-2010.01432.x|pmid=20573103|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu &amp; Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.

The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=T. A.|author2=Hornsey, M. J. |author3=Postmes, T. |title=Shifting ground: The variable use of essentialism in contexts of inclusion and exclusion|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1348/014466607X270287|pmid=18171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Morton, Hornsey &amp; Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Medin | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Atran | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = The native mind: biological categorization and reasoning in development and across cultures | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.111.4.960 | pmid = 15482069 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 111 | issue = 4| pages = 960-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] of Yale University has stated that "one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom. P. (2010) Why we like what we like. ''Observer''. 23 (8), 3 [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/october-10/why-we-like-what-we-like.html online link].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastian|first=B.|author2=Haslam, N.|title=Psychological essentialism and stereotype endorsement|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=228–235|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2006).

==In ethics==
Classical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.

Many modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.

==In biology==

One possibility is that before [[evolution]] was developed as a [[scientific theory]], there existed an essentialist view of [[biology]] that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution. The History of an Idea |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06386-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[creation-evolution controversy|religious opponents of evolution]] continue to maintain this view of biology.

Recent work by historians of [[systematics|systematic biology]] has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as [[Linnaeus]] and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called "essentialism story" (or "myth") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from [[Aristotle]] onwards through to [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[William Whewell]] in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.&lt;ref&gt;Amundson, R. (2005) ''The changing rule of the embryo in evolutionary biology: structure and synthesis'', New York, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller-Wille | first1=Staffan | year=2007 | title=Collection and collation: theory and practice of Linnaean botany | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume=38 | issue=3| pages=541–562 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2007.06.010| pmid=17893064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Winsor | first1=M.

== Gender essentialism ==
{{main|Gender essentialism}}

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication ''Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies'' that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grosz|first1 = Elizabeth|title =Space, Time, and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies |date = 1995|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2017|isbn = 9780415911375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 ''New York Times'' best seller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as ''Women: Images &amp; Realities''.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"/&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. [[Evelyn Fox Keller]],&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Harding]],
&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Harding, ''The Science Question in Feminism'', Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Tuana]]
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'', Indiana University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature.  Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. [[Herodotus]], for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a "softness" which has made Egypt easy to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;DeLapp 177.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity,&lt;ref&gt;Lape 149-52.&lt;/ref&gt; or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism had been operative in [[colonialism]] as well as in critiques of colonialism.

[[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial]] theorists such as [[Edward Said]] insisted that essentialism was the "defining mode" of "Western" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to [[Touraj Atabaki]], manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as [[Eurocentrism]], over-generalization, and reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians reject essentialism because it "dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of [[Subaltern Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evita, vida y obra de Eva Perón''''' ({{lang-es|Evita, life and work of Eva Perón}}) is an Argentine historical comic book by [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Alberto Breccia]], which narrates the biography of [[Eva Perón]]. It was censored at the time of creation and was published after Oesterheld's death.

==Editorial story==
The Argentine comic book authors [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Alberto Breccia]] started in 1968 a number of comic books devoted to the biographies of important people of Latin American history. The first issue was ''[[Vida del Che]]'' ({{lang-es|Life of Che}}), and it was about [[Che Guevara]]. When it was finished and published, they started working in one for Eva Perón. However, when Che's comic book was published, it was removed from distribution and all copies of it were destroyed. Facing such situation, Oesterheld stopped the whole project. Although Oesterheld had finished the script and Breccia the drawings, the production was not finished.&lt;ref&gt;"''Apenas Che apareció a la venta, Oesterheld comenzó a trabajar en el argumento de Evita y consecuentemente Breccia empezó con los dibujos. En medio de esto, Che fue retirado de la venta y los originales destruidos. Esta persecución obligó al editor a considerar abortado el proyecto y los autores, consecuentemente, lo abandonaron''" Doeyo, "Palabras del editor"&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Breccia received a new offer to draw a comic book about Eva Perón. It had a politically neutral script, whereas the one by Oesterheld had a radical peronist style. The art was the same than in the unpublished comic book, but being coloured, whereas the original was meant to be a black and white comic book.&lt;ref&gt;"''Entre 1969 y 1970 se editó con otro guionista y dibujo de Breccia, en una versión despolitizada, inconseguible hoy por hoy''". Martignone, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Oesterheld was [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] in 1978 and Breccia died in 1993.

In 2002, the editor [[Javier Doeyo]] found the original script written by Oesterheld at the house of Breccia's widow, while searching for material for another project.&lt;ref&gt;"''en mayo de 2001 [...] me encontraba hurgando entre las carpetas de Breccia en casa de su viuda Irma, en busca del guión faltante de un capítulo de Buscavidas que estaba sin letrear. Para mi sorpresa [...] encuentro el argumento original de Oesterheld con el que Breccia empezó a trabajar y que por la cancelación del proyecto dejó de lado''" Doeyo, "Palabras del editor"&lt;/ref&gt; With this script, he could restore the original unpublished comic book. The art was already published as described, and the colours were removed to restore the originally intended black &amp; white by using image editing software. The script received minor corrections, fixing outdated information.&lt;ref name="panfleto"&gt;"''...actualizadas ciertas partes históricas (se recuperó el cadáver de Eva tras su abominable hurto [...]), la biografía es arrolladora y panfletaria, pero cuenta la historia de nuestro país''". Martignone, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the fate of Evita's corpse was still unknown in 1968, whereas by 2002 it had been recovered and placed at [[La Recoleta cemetery]].&lt;ref name="panfleto"/&gt;

The work was thus published in 2002 by [[Doedytores]]. In 2007 it was edited again by [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]], along with work about Che, as part of a series of reprints of noteworthy comic books.

==Description==
The comic book describes the life of Eva Perón in a biographical manner, from birth to death. It has a strong [[peronist]] point of view, and is highly critical of the military and other political forces.&lt;ref name="panfleto"/&gt; It does not employ the common techniques of the genre, and hasn't any [[speech balloon]]s or [[sequential art]]. The drawings are used merely to illustrate the events being described by the text. Alberto Breccia would explain that "''My work is testimonial, it can't be otherwise, because it includes characters like Goulart, Frondizi, Mao...''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Mi trabajo es testimonial, no podría ser de otra manera porque aparecían personajes como Goulart, Frondizi, Mao..." (Breccia) Doeyo, "Palabras del editor".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pictures are made from famous photos or iconography of the time. For example, the first image (used by Doeyo to design the comic book cover) is based upon the cover of Evita's autobiography, ''[[La Razón de mi Vida]]''.

[[File:Wimpernzange.jpg|alt=The picture shows a metal eyelash curler laying on its side|thumb|An unheated metal eyelash curler]]
An '''eyelash curler''' is a hand-operated mechanical device for curling [[Eyelash|eyelashes]] for cosmetic purposes. Usually only the upper eyelashes are curled. 

==History==
There were different patents of this invention between 1923 and 1940. The first known patent for the eyelash curler states that it was filed by Charles Stickel and William McDonell from Rochester, New York. However, William Joseph Beldue is recognized as one the first inventors while he was working in Kurlash Co., in Rochester, NY. [[William Beldue]] and his Kurlash Company held patents in [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] for the eyelash curler and improvements to it.

In the 1930s and in 1940s, at the top of the make up fashion, these curlers were very popular and not expensive. The eyelash curler was patented April 7, 1931 and the images drawn in the patent application look very much the same as the eyelash curlers seen on the market today. Originally named Rodal, the brand smartly changed the product’s name to Kurlash. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eyelashesinhistory.com/20th_century_IV.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quailbellmagazine.com/the-real/history-of-the-eyelash-curler|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyelash curlers are usually made of metal, and often have rubber pads where the curlers make contact with the lashes. The general design of these devices remains the same from 1940s. Manufacturers include ForteBellezza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortebellezza.com|title=Eyelash curler manufacturer|last=Robinson|first=Mary|work=Wed, Aug 13, 2014 06:37 AM EDT}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiseido]] and [[Shu Uemura]].

== Types ==
The two most common types of eyelash curlers are heated curlers and traditional eyelash curlers. Heated eyelash curlers deliver a more intense curl that lasts longer. However a simpler step to add to an eye makeup routine includes a more traditional, unheated eyelash curler. An unheated curler that is curved for the natural shape of an individual's eye includes a plentiful enough pad to press against eyelashes. Before using, an unheated curler can be heated for a short time with a [[hair dryer]], but not to the extent to burn the delicate skin above the eyes. Self-heating, battery-operated units are available.

==Usage==

For traditional eyelash curlers, start by holding the curler like a pair of scissors and opening it completely. Keep your eyes open and bring the tool towards your upper lashes. Place your lashes in between the top and padded base, stopping as close to the root of your eyelashes as possible without pinching skin. For the first round of curling, keep your tool upright by the roots of your lashes. Check that all of your lashes are inside the curler.

To avoid a sharp bend and to create a natural curled look, gently release the curler and move it up the lash, away from the lid, by one or two millimeters, and again clamp the lashes for five to 10 seconds. Gently release the curler and repeat the process one or two more times, moving the curler up the lashes, closer to the end of the lashes each time. Continue avoiding a sharp bend by moving the curler slightly up the lashes away from the roots for another clamp. Lastly, wiggle the curler up towards the tip of your lashes and close down softly with the same pulsating pressure to complete the curl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southernliving.com/fashion-beauty/beauty-makeup/how-to-use-eyelash-curler|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy trick is to start with the lash curler at the base of your lashes and then do a slow blink. The pressure of the blink helps curl your lashes as they move through the curler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-and-beauty/eyelash-curler.aspx|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you're using a clamp-style heated curler, start crimping at the base of your lashes and then slowly ease the curler toward the ends. One swoop - from the base to upwards takes around 10 to 15 seconds, gently holding in certain areas to set the curl. It is the combination of heat and holding the position that creates the style of curl. Take time to bend the lashes back and push back to create the curl you want. Move slowly and experiment with the angles at which you hold it.

In order to create the effects of a heated eyelash curler with only the accessibility of a traditional one, a user can warm it up with a [[hair dryer]]. To get the best results, it is recommended to use it directly after warming up with a hair dryer because it lasts longer. When using heated eyelash curlers, it is very important to be cautious of the temperature the curler is heated to. To avoid the risk of burning the eyelid with the hot metal curlers, many companies have introduced plastic based curlers. Some companies are looking into introducing self-heated curlers to control the temperature and completely eliminate the risk of a burn.

To begin, warm up the curler and then curl the [[Eyelash|eyelashes]] for 10 to 15 seconds. Continue curling them until you have the desired shape. Next, apply more coats of [[mascara]] and curl the eyelashes once more for the final look. Repeat the application of mascara and curling of the lashes until the desired length is reached. Due to varying eyelash length, some users may need to apply mascara and curl the eyelashes multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shine.yahoo.com/shine-beauty/eyelash-curler-way-153700337.html|title=How to use an eyelash curler - the RIGHT way!|last=Ducharme|first=Andrea|date=July 20, 2012|publisher=GALTime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Advantages==
An eyelash curler is a good [[makeup]] kit tool because it gives the illusion of bigger and brighter eyes and helps lengthen the eyelashes. When it is applied using different tactics such going heavier on the outer corner eyelashes, it gives a different and well-defined shape to the eyes. It is easy to use without professional training and is not very expensive to purchase. Additionally, it is not a very big tool, so it can be comfortably placed in the makeup bag.

A heated eyelash curler makes the curling process easier and an eyelash curl to last significantly longer. The heated element of the curler saves time and unnecessary pressure for a user, creating an easily curl without the need to hold the clamp down for long periods of time. Alongside this, the majority of heated curlers are wand-like, which means there's nothing pulling or pinching at your eyes. If a user has fragile lashes or lashes that are falling out, a heated eyelash curler will lift up eyelashes for a gentle curl without applying any force whatsoever. Heated eyelash curlers also tame and even out eyelashes that stick out in different directions, creating a flawless look for a user. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://belashed.org/best-heated-eyelash-curler/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Disadvantages==
Among many advantages, there are some disadvantages to the eyelash curler. If not used with care, pulling on the eyelashes while curling can lead to weakening of the roots. Many people can damage their eyelashes by holding down the clamp on their lashes for increased lengths of time, leading to their lashes either being pulled out or falling out due to the stress of continuous clamping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buydeestore.com/tag/advantages-of-eyelash-curler/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in the eyelashes becoming weak and eventually lead to shedding which can be very bad for an eye because they protect the eye from wind and dust and don’t grow back quickly.&lt;p&gt;If not used carefully, eyelash curlers can lead to accidents where a user pinches the eyelid. Depending on the amount of pressure they apply, this can cause a serious injury to the eye. Similarly, when used warm, an eyelash curler, especially those made of metal, can cause serious burns to the eyelid. Also, some heated eyelash curlers require batteries to run, which will require maintenance to run in terms of replacement on time for smooth functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

'''''Flags of Our Fathers''''' (2000) is a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestselling book by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] with [[Ron Powers]] about the six [[United States Marines]] who would eventually be made famous by [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s lauded photograph of the [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|flag raising at Iwo Jima]], one of the costliest and most horrifying battles of [[World War II]]'s [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]].  The flag raisers were [[Harold Schultz]],  [[Rene Gagnon]], [[Ira Hayes]], [[Mike Strank]], [[Harlon Block]], and [[Franklin Sousley]]; the latter three men died later in the battle.  Strank was a [[Sergeant]] who refused several promotions during the battle in order to "Bring his boys back to their mothers."  Block was a [[Corporal]] who reported to Strank, and the rest were [[Private (rank)|Privates]] in the Marines, except for [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], a Navy Corpsman who administered first aid to Easy [[Company (military unit)|Company]] of 2nd [[Battalion]], [[28th Marines]], [[5th Marine Division]], the company to which all the flag raisers were assigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bradley-flags.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=James Bradley|author2=Ron Powers|title=Flags of Our Fathers|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The book, published in May 2000 by [[Bantam Books]], a division of [[Random House]], spent 46 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' nonfiction bestseller list, spending six weeks at number one. Shortly after the book's publication, Steven Spielberg acquired the option on the film rights for [[DreamWorks Pictures]].

The book follows the lives of the six flag-raisers through their early lives of innocence, military training, fierce combat and afterward, when they were sent on tours to raise money for [[war bond]]s.

The film adaptation ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', which opened in the U.S. on October 20, 2006, was directed by [[Clint Eastwood]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], with a screenplay written by [[William Broyles, Jr.]] and [[Paul Haggis]].

'''''For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]] dramatizing a hundred years of American [[film criticism]] through film clips, historic photographs, and on-camera interviews with many of today’s important reviewers, mostly print but also Internet. It was produced by Amy Geller, written and directed by long-time [[Boston Phoenix]] film critic [[Gerald Peary]], and narrated by [[Patricia Clarkson]]. Critics featured include [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Kenneth Turan]] of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', and [[Elvis Mitchell]], host of the [[KCRW|public radio show]] ''The Treatment''.

Many more critics, journalists, and writers from the present and past appear in film clips and interviews. Among them: [[Jami Bernard]], [[Manny Farber]], [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Molly Haskell]], [[J. Hoberman]], [[Harlan Jacobson]], [[Stanley Kauffmann]], [[Stuart Klawans]], [[Leonard Maltin]], [[Janet Maslin]], [[Wesley Morris]], [[Rex Reed]], [[B. Ruby Rich]], [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], [[Richard Schickel]], [[David Sterritt]], [[Pauline Kael]], [[Richard Corliss]], and [[Gene Siskel]].

Other figures from film history appear in photographs and include [[Vincent Canby]], [[Bosley Crowther]], [[James Agee]], [[Otis Ferguson]], [[Vachel Lindsay]], and [[Frank E. Woods]].

Bringing the history of film criticism up to the present, the film introduces internet-based critics [[Harry Knowles]] of ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' and [[Karina Longworth]], who wrote at the time for ''spout.com''.

==Theme==
Gerald Peary says, "''For the Love of Movies'' is the first feature documentary to tell the rich, colorful, and undeniably controversial story of the American film critic ... I had to sort of invent what I think is the history of film criticism, because there wasn’t any formally written book on it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/today/node/7812 Gerald Peary interview] by Robin Berghaus of ''[[BU Today]]'', 12 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to difficulties in getting financial backing, the documentary took nearly a decade to make.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/movies/homevideo/30kehr.html?_r=1 For the Love of Movies, DVD release] [[New York Times]], 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Peary says, "I guess one of the things that happened during that period was the so-called decline of print journalism ... eight years ago, film criticism still seemed a viable profession ... by now, there are over fifty critics who are ''made redundant''"&lt;ref name=cairns&gt;[https://dcairns.wordpress.com/tag/for-the-love-of-movies/ Edinburgh International Film Festival: Interview with Gerald Peary] by [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]] of ''Shadowplay'', 28 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker Magazine asks:  What is the crisis of criticism? Gerald Peary replies:  Simply that if you are a print critic you are in danger of losing your job at any moment. As newspapers are worried about dropping dead, it seems like film critics are a particular target. The film begins by saying, "There are 24 critics who have lost their jobs in the last several years," but since we finished the film, many more have lost their jobs. A lot of people are tagged with a title of ''ex-critic'', but they were not ''ex'' when we filmed them just a few years ago. Sure, you can work on the web, but if you do that you're not getting paid much, or at all. And critics should be paid — this isn't an amateur thing to do, it's not like Sunday painting.&lt;ref name=macaulay&gt;[http://filmmakermagazine.com/news/2009/03/for-the-love-of-movies-gerald-peary-by-alicia-van-couvering/ Interview with Gerald Peary] by Scott Macaulay of [[Filmmaker (magazine)|''Filmmaker'' Magazine]], 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's a stop-the-bleeding movie," Peary tells [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]. "I hope that those who watch the movie value criticism and will read it and demand it in their newspapers."&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;[http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2009/04/swsw-american-critics.html review] by Anne Thompson  of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], 08 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Peary laments, "Today, people select which movies to see based on advertising. Lots of excellent little pictures — foreign, independent, and documentaries — are passing through without being seen. The only way to get people to go to those films, because they have no advertising budgets, is reviews by good critics ... We want people to read criticism. One way to motivate people to do that is by showing the critics’ faces and letting their voices be heard."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/today/node/9469 Movie Love] by Robin Berghaus of BU Today, 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
* Scott Macaulay: "''For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism'' is a tender and detailed documentary spanning the art form’s beginnings, middle, present and future."&lt;ref name=macaulay/&gt;
* Victoria Large: "Peary has wisely determined that the best defense of film criticism is, well, film criticism itself. In addition to archive footage and lively interviews, he includes voice-over readings of excerpts of film reviews past, lively passages that remind us that great critics have to be great writers, astute observers and thinkers who are skilled in expressing themselves."&lt;ref name=large&gt;[http://notcoming.com/reviews/fortheloveofmovies/ Interview with Gerald Peary] by Victoria Large of ''[[Not Coming to a Theater Near You]]'', 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Guillen:  "Gerald Peary sharply evaluates the history of critical-analytical writing on moving pictures in this stimulating tour through the rise, fall and reorientation of film criticism in the United States ... a smart look at key figures and how they've changed public consciousness of both the movies and criticism itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theeveningclass.blogspot.com/2009/04/sfiff52-for-love-of-movies-story-of.html review] by Michael Guillen of the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle]], 23 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roger Ebert]]: "I enjoyed it immensely, I learned a lot. Very well done, edited, researched — and narrated!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/flm.html review], at ''Bullfrog Films'', 20 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eugene Hernandez:  "Peary spent nearly a decade making ''For the Love of Movies'', working with producer Amy Geller to examine the history and future of film criticism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/article/eugene_hernandez_for_the_love_of_movies/# review] by Eugene Hernandez of ''[[indieWIRE]]'', 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]]:  "Thus the film, which offers an excellent history of American film criticism, also serves as a valentine to a vanishing profession, something Peary could never have foreseen ... It's hard not to feel sad at the end of this movie, about a world that no longer exists, a profession that seems to be dying in front of our eyes."&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;
* [[David Bordwell]]:  "It’s a lively and thoughtful survey, interspersing interviews with contemporary critics with a chronological account that runs from Frank E. Woods to Harry Knowles ... ''For the Love of Movies'' offers a concise, entertaining account of mass-market movie criticism, and I think a lot of universities would want to use it in film and journalism courses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=4102 essay] by [[Kristin Thompson]] and David Bordwell of David Bordwell's ''Website on Cinema'', 03 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ty Burr]]:  "...this is a meal no one has ever cooked before: an affectionate, knowledgeable overview of film criticism from the silent era to the Internet ... the movie’s a lively and important first step in assaying the worth of a field on the verge of extinction, as more and more professional reviewers are let go from struggling news organizations (nearly 60 in the past 3 1/2 years)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/09/09/an_insider_looks_at_film_criticism_through_the_years/ review] by Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 09 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chris Faraone:  "... Peary incinerates the barrier between subject and reporter, demonstrating more than mere comprehension of the art he's scrutinized for decades ... his larger challenge was to assemble a story that would entertain not just critics but those pedestrians who don’t know Cinéaste from bouillabaisse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Movies/89032-Love-letter/ review] by Chris Faraone of ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'', 03 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jeffrey Wells:  "''For The Love of Movies''…is finally here and it does the job nicely. Which is to say intelligently, competently, lovingly and, after a fashion, comprehensively ... It's a hell of a subject — a chronicle of magnificent obsessions and magnificent dreams, and a rise-and-fall story covering scores of critics, the entirety of the Hollywood film culture from the '20s to the present, and hundreds if not thousands of movies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2009/03/those_were_the.php review] by Jeffrey Wells of ''Hollywood Elsewhere'', 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chale Nafus:  "Gerald Peary’s seminal cinematic exploration of the wealth of American film criticism provides a wonderful roadmap of where we have been and observes the many directions the whole endeavor is now moving."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persistenceofvision.org/2010/01/for-the-love-of-movies-the-story-of-american-film-criticism-a-documentary-by-gerald-peary/ review] by Chale Nafus of the ''Journal of the Austin Film Society'', 01 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''’s [[Joe Leydon]] argued that for "all its attempts to offer an expansive and exhaustive historical account, the docu is riddled with glaring gaps and facile transitions. Some notables are extremely conspicuous by their absence. Inexplicably, there’s absolutely no mention of [[Judith Crist]], even though her prominent outlets — ''[[The Today Show]]'', ''[[New York magazine]]'', and ''[[TV Guide]]'' — made her, arguably, the most widely known U.S. critic in the 1960s and early ‘70s."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/for-the-love-of-movies-the-story-of-american-film-criticism-1200473987/ review] by Joe Leydon of ''Variety'', 27 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4292}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt; Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Background==
A similar bill was passed by the House during the [[112th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=lawyersCHP1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalheritagelaw.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1842909|publisher=The Lawyers' Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4292sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act would amend the federal judicial code with respect to denial of a foreign state's immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. or state courts (under the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]]) in cases where rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property (or any property exchanged for it) is: (1) present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on by the foreign state in the United States; or (2) owned by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state, and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would prohibit consideration as a commercial activity (excluded from jurisdictional immunity) any activity in the United States of a foreign state, or of any carrier, associated with a temporary exhibition or display if: (1) the work of art (or other object of cultural significance) is imported into the United States from any foreign country pursuant to an agreement for its temporary exhibition or display between a foreign state that is its owner or custodian and the United States or cultural or educational institutions within it; and (2) the [[President of the United States|President]] has determined, with notice in the [[Federal Register]], that such work is culturally significant and its temporary exhibition or display is in the national interest. (Thus, grants jurisdictional immunity to the foreign state and associated carrier for such works.)&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would deny application of this prohibition to cases concerning rights in property taken in violation of international law in which: (1) the action is based upon a claim that the work was taken between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, by the government of Germany or any government in Europe occupied, assisted, or allied by the German government; (2) the court determines that the activity associated with the exhibition or display is commercial; and (3) that determination is necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign state.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 2, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4292&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4292|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45296|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on information provided by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4292 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 4292 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest. However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts. H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

H.R. 4292 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on March 25, 2014 by [[Steve Chabot|Rep. Steve Chabot (R, OH-1)]].&lt;ref name=4292allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].&lt;ref name="4292allactions"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill "narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to make it easier for U.S. cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries."&lt;ref name=4292gop&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 4292|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4292-the-foreign-cultural-exchange-jurisdictional-immunity-clarification-act/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were "taken in violation of international law by [[Nazi Germany]] between January 30, 1933 and [[Victory in Europe Day|May 8, 1945]]."&lt;ref name="4292gop"/&gt;

In an editorial, [[Tess Davis]] of the [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Marc Masurovsky]] of the [[Holocaust Art Restitution Project]], spoke out in opposition to the bill.&lt;ref name=Davis1&gt;{{cite news|title=US bill would allow museums to knowingly exhibit stolen art|url=http://theconversation.com/us-bill-would-allow-museums-to-knowingly-exhibit-stolen-art-25637|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=The Conversation|date=2 May 2014|author=Tess Davis|author2=Marc Masurovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would "prevent claimants from recovering their rightful property" and enable museums to "knowingly be able to exhibit stolen and looted art and antiquities."&lt;ref name="Davis1"/&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would weaken U.S. law and undermine the American tradition of honoring property rights.

'''Grosvenor Chambers''' at number 9 [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] was Australia's first custom built complex of artist's studios.

It housed many famous Australian artists studios. Some artists who held studios there include, [[Tom Roberts]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Clara Southern]], [[Jane Sutherland]], [[Charles Conder]], [[E. Phillips Fox]], [[John Longstaff]], [[Max Meldrum]], [[Mirka Mora]], [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]] and [[Wolfgang Sievers]].

It was established in 1888 and held studios until the mid-1970s when all but the facade of the building was demolished for a high rise office building.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Taylor, ''Perils of the Studio: Inside the Artistic Affairs of Bohemian Melbourne'', Australian Scholarly Publishing &amp; State Library of Victoria: North Melbourne, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-74097-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon De Lisle ( photographic artist ) was a studio resident at Grosvenor Chambers during the 1950s. Wolfgang Sievers ( photographer ), Mirka Mora and Albert Tucker were also in residence at this time.

'''''Grumbles from the Grave''''' is a posthumous 1989 autobiography of science fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] collated by his wife [[Virginia Heinlein]] from his notes and writings.

==Background==
The work is the closest that Heinlein, an ex-naval officer and prominent [[science fiction]] writer, came to writing an autobiography. The book contains a wide range of correspondence, notes and memoirs edited by Heinlein's wife Virginia, and was published a year and a half after his death.

==Contents==
''Grumbles from the Grave'' provides insight into Heinlein's writing process (and the editorial/publishing process with which he was often at odds).   In addition, it contains evidence of his philosophy as applied to his life and personal opinions.  Beginning with a short biography of Robert by Virginia, the bulk of the book consists of excerpts of correspondence from the period from 1939 to 1970, from when he began writing science fiction until the onset of his first major illness. There is considerable information provided into how the 13-year gestation of Heinlein's novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' evolved. Additionally there is the original postlude to ''[[Podkayne of Mars]]'' and a discussion of cuts made to his novel, ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]''.

==Criticisms==
[[Frederik Pohl]] has complained "Robert had talked about allowing posthumous publication of his real feelings about a lot of things that he didn’t feel comfortable to talk about while he was alive, and indicated that some of his private letters would be a source for the book. Then some posthumous book with that title did come out, and it was a great disappointment. Someone — it could have been only [Virginia Heinlein] — had washed his face and combed his hair and turned whatever it was that Robert might have wanted to say into the equivalent of thank-you notes for a respectable English tea. I know that Robert wrote some much more raunchy letters than any of those, because I myself got one or two. But all the raunch has been edited out. What’s left is actually rather boring and does a great disservice to the real Heinlein, whose physical person may have been embodied as a conventional hard-right conservative but whose writing was — sometimes vulgarly — that of a free-thinking iconoclast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/05/the-wives-and-drives-of-robert-heinlein-ginny/ |title=The Wives (and Drives) of Robert Heinlein: Ginny |publisher=Thewaythefutureblogs.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
The book was a finalist for the 1990 [[Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book]].

'''''Haystacks''''' is the common English title for a [[Serial imagery|series]] of [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[painting]]s by [[Claude Monet]]. The principal subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested [[wheat]] (or possibly [[barley]] or [[oats]]: the original French title, '''''Les Meules à Giverny''''', simply means '''''The Stacks at Giverny'''''). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]] series ([[Wildenstein Index Number|Wildenstein Index Numbers]] 1266-1290) which Monet began near the end of the summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.

The series is famous for the way in which Monet repeated the same subject to show the differing [[light]] and [[atmosphere]] at different times of day, across the [[seasons]] and in many types of [[weather]].

The series is among Monet's most notable work. The largest ''Haystacks'' collections are held at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] and [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] in Paris, and in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. Other collections include the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=34078&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=41|title=Collection Search Results: Grainstack (Snow Effect)|accessdate=July 3, 2007|year=2007|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205040316/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=34078&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=41|archivedate=December 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=32189&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=21|title=Collection Search Results: Grainstack (Sunset)|accessdate=July 3, 2007|year=2007|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027003450/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=32189&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=21|archivedate=October 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Metropolitan Museum]] and [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmonet.com/Galleries/Where_Held_Opening_Page.htm|accessdate=October 9, 2007|title=Country-by-Country List of Museums Holding Originals (Monet)|publisher=artofmonet.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025132118/http://www.artofmonet.com/Galleries/Where_Held_Opening_Page.htm|archivedate=October 25, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paris' [[Musée de l'Orangerie]].

==Monet background==
{{main|Claude Monet}}
Monet settled in [[Giverny]] in 1883. Most of his paintings from 1883 until his death 40 years later were of scenes within {{convert|3|km|0}} of his home. Monet was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region’s landscape and by the endless variations in the days and in the seasons - the stacks were just outside his door.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet had previously painted a single subject in different light and different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects but with the overall color harmonies that allowed him an autonomous use of rich color.&lt;ref&gt;House, page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional wisdom was that the stacks were a simple subject but also an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers and friends of the artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Monet undertook to capture the stacks in direct light and then to re-examine them from the same view-point in different, often more muted, light and atmospheric conditions. It was then not unusual for Monet, in search of harmonious transitions within the series, to alter the canvases back in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;"It is worth remembering that the stacks were literally at his doorstep, as photographs of the area make clear {{cite book |first=Paul Hayes |last=Tucker |authorlink=Paul Hayes Tucker |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ojp0NUShY4YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tucker%2C%20Paul%20Hayes%2C%20Monet%20in%20the%20'90s%3A%20The%20Series%20Paintings%2C%201989&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |year=1989 |isbn=9780300049138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series background==
The stacks depicted in the series are commonly referred to in English as hay, wheat or grain-stacks. In reality they stored [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]]s of grain primarily for bread - so [[wheat]] [or possibly [[barley]] or [[oats]]] - and not [[hay]], an animal food. The {{convert|10|to|20|ft|adj=on}} stacks were a way of keeping the sheafs dry until the grain could be separated from the stalks by [[threshing]].&lt;ref name=MiN143&gt;Lemonedes, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The local method of storing and drying unthreshed-grains was to use wheat-straw, or sometimes hay, as a thatched 'roof' for the stack, shielding the wheat, barley or oats from the elements until, once dry-enough, they could be threshed. The [[threshing machine]]s then traveled from village to village. Thus, although the grain was harvested and the stacks were built by July, it often took until the following spring or even later - so through all the light and atmosphere changes of summer, autumn, winter and spring - for all the stacks to be reached by the threshing-machines. Grain storage/drying-stacks like these became common throughout [[Europe]] in the 19th century and survived until the inception of [[combine harvesters]]. Although the shapes of stacks were regional, in [[Normandy]], where Giverny is situated, it was common for them to be round with quite steeply-pitched thatched 'roofs' - just as Monet painted.

The stacks belonged to Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing the way the light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for overcast conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kelder, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her [[wheelbarrow]] could hold.&lt;ref&gt;The veracity of this story has been doubted: '"When I began I was like the others; I believed that two canvases would suffice, one for gray weather and one for sun! At the time I was painting some stacks.... One day I saw that my light had changed. I said to my stepdaughter: 'Go to the house, if you don't mind, and bring me another canvas!'" And so Monet worked on the story: another canvas! Another! The fact is that ever since he had started to paint he had had the habit of working from the same ''motif'' under different conditions.... And yet there is something new here, a difference of emphasis.' Forge and Gordon, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting [[paint]]s, [[easel]]s and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled the scene of the moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks ''[[en plein air]]'', Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.&lt;ref name=MIN139&gt;Lemonedes, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet produced numerous ''Haystacks'' paintings. He painted five paintings (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1213-1217) with stacks as his primary subject during the 1888 harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier [[Landscape art|landscapes]] (Wildenstein Index Number 900-995, 1073) had included stacks [and also some more-accurately described [[hay]]ricks: that is smaller piles of hay for animal-feed] in an ancillary manner. The general consensus is that only the canvases produced using the 1890 harvest (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) comprise the ''Haystacks'' series proper. However some commentators include additional paintings when referencing this series. For example, the [[Hill-Stead Museum]] talk of their two stack paintings even though one is from the 'proper' 1890 harvest, the other from the 1888 harvest.&lt;ref name=HSM/&gt; 

Monet's ''Haystacks'' series is one of his earliest to rely on repetition to illustrate nuances in his perception across natural variations such as times of day, seasons, and types of weather.  For Monet, the concept of producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and vantage point began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the ''Valley of the Creuse'', and subsequently shown at the [[Art gallery|Galerie]] [[Georges Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; This interest in the serial [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] would continue for the rest of his career.

==Thematic issues==
Although the mundane subject was constant throughout the ''Haystack'' series, the underlying theme may be seen as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series.&lt;ref&gt;So as to return to a painting at the correct moment, "on occasion Monet took the precaution of writing the time of day on the back of his canvases". House, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.&lt;ref name=MIN139/&gt;

Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, Monet focused on ''Haystacks'' and a number of other subjects (other series included the ''Mornings on the [[Seine]],'' ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplar]]s'', ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]],'' the ''[[London Parliament (Monet)|Houses of Parliament]],'' and the ''[[Water Lilies]],'' among others). In order to work on many paintings virtually simultaneously, he would awake before [[dawn]] so as to begin at the earliest time of day:

{{cquote|...for the Early Mornings on the Seine series, he chose to paint at and before dawn, which made it 'an easier subject and simpler lighting than usual', because at this time of day the effects did not change so rapidly; however, this involved him getting up at 3:30 a.m., which seems to have been unprecedented even for so inveterate an early riser as Monet."&lt;ref&gt;House, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the morning progressed and the light changed he would switch to sequentially later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Alice Monet dated March 29, 1893, Monet wrote of having worked on fourteen paintings in one day at Rouen. House, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt; The process would be repeated over the course of days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.

Certain effects of light only last for a few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera received attention for no more than a few minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1883 Jules Laforgue had spoken of a quarter hour as the natural time span for an Impressionist painting, while Monet himself mentioned seven minutes as the limit for one of his Poplar series...and in 1918 talked of effects which lasted 'sometimes three or four minutes at the most'". House, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent [[sunrise]]s, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series.&lt;ref&gt;"The constantly varying weather, rather than any idea of a final pictorial ensemble, remained his initial reason for endlessly multiplying his canvases." House, page 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, different [[hue]]s are evident in each painting, and in each work, [[color]] is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color [[spectrum]]. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.&lt;ref&gt;"In ''Grain Stack at Sunset'' intense brick reds give the shadowed side of the stack an incandescent core, while the light of the sunset haloes the stack with vermilion and yellow, and scatters the lit parts of the field with particles of pink, orange, and mauve." House, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable painters have been influenced by this particular series including [[Les Fauves]], [[Derain]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck|Vlaminck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impressionist-art-gallery.com/monet_haystacks.html|accessdate=October 1, 2007|year=2006|publisher=Impressionist Art Gallery|title=Monet Haystacks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009052515/http://www.impressionist-art-gallery.com/monet_haystacks.html|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'s memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which I had not understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.”&lt;ref&gt;Excerpts from Kandinsky's memoirs, page 53. [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5v19n9xh&amp;doc.view=content&amp;chunk.id=d0e2244&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;anchor.id=0&amp;brand=eschol CDlib.org] Retrieved May 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:1274 Grainstacks Snow Effect, Meules, effet de neige, 1890-91, 60 x 100cm, Oil on Canvas, Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, CT.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Grainstacks, Snow Effect'', 1890-91, [[National Gallery of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].]]
The ''Haystacks'' series was a financial success.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.77"&gt;Tucker, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen of these were exhibited by [[Durand-Ruel]] in May 1891, and every painting sold within days.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.77"/&gt; The exhibit met with great public acclaim. [[Octave Mirbeau]] described Monet's daring series as representing "what lies beyond progress itself." Others described the stacks as "faces of the landscape" - they represented the [[countryside]] as a retreat from daily problems and home for contentment with nature. [[Camille Pissarro]] said: "These canvases breathe contentment."&lt;ref name=MiN143/&gt; Most of the paintings sold immediately for as much as 1,000 [[franc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"...before the show even opened, Durand-Ruel purchased eight of the fifteen ''Grainstacks'' that the artist would exhibit. In the meantime, Monet had been able to sell two others that he would include in the exhibition...That meant that of the fifteen stacks that went on view in May 1891, ten were already spoken for, leaving only five for anyone who might have been interested." Tucker, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Monet’s prices, in general, began to rise steeply. As a result, he was able to buy outright the house and grounds at [[Giverny]] and to start constructing a [[Nymphaeaceae|waterlily]] [[pond]]. After years of mere subsistence living, he was able to enjoy success.

The series demonstrates his intense study of light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings that he found wanting.&lt;ref&gt;"Many accounts speak of Monet destroying incomplete abortive paintings; with the London series and the Water Lilies of 1903-1909 the destructions seem to have been very extensive. In 1907, when deferring his exhibition of Water Lilies, he told Durand-Ruel that he had destroyed 'at least thirty of them, to my great satisfaction'." House, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.

==1888-1889 paintings==
From the 1888 harvest, Monet produced three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) against the backdrop of hills along the left bank of the [[Seine]] and a few [[Giverny]] houses to the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.&lt;ref&gt;Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1989, pp. 156-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hollow Church''' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Šuplja crkva'') is a [[name]] given to a part of the archeological [[excavations]] of what used to be a [[Croatia]]n [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[church (building)|church]] in the 11th century. Originally named ''Basillica of Saint Peter and Moses'',&lt;ref name=gen&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.solin.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=195 Solin.hr - Šuplja crkva]&lt;/ref&gt; the building was built on the foundations of an older Christian church next to a 6th-century [[Byzantine]] [[chapel]] in the vicinity of the ancient ruins of [[Salona]].{{Coord|43|32|32.12|N|16|29|31.07|E|display=inline,title|type:landmark_region:HR}}

The church is notable for being the crowning place of [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|King Zvonimir]], and along the lines of buildings like ''Saint Stephen'' and ''Saint Mary'' in [[Solin]], is one of the remains of churches built by the [[Croats]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=gen/&gt; It had three apses; 26 meters long and 13 meters in width, each separated by a [[column]]. The [[narthex]] was positioned on the western entrance, while the southern side obtained a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]], from which only few steps still remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destinacije.com/Slike/Hrvatska/CrkveiKatedrale/Suplja_Crkva.JPG Photograph from Destinacije.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; The narthex allegedly contained a [[sarcophagus]] quite possibly of a [[King of Croatia|Croatian king]].

'''Hoora''' ({{lang-ar|الحورة}}) a district of [[Manama]], the capital of [[Bahrain]].

Along with the [[Central Business District, Manama|Central Business District]], [[Adliya]], and [[Juffair]], Hoora is considered as one of Manama's [[nightlife]] centres, with many bars, hotels, restaurants, pubs and [[nightclub]]s (both [[Arab]]ic and [[Western world|Western]]), and it is very popular with Arab visitors to Bahrain.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The '''Exhibitions Avenue''' is the most prominent location in Hoora. In the evenings, especially during weekends, this avenue becomes a very busy street with many tourists, locals, and foreigners.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The area contains several tourist attractions, including one of the world's premier collections of [[Islam]]ic manuscripts and art, [[Beit Al Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beitalquran.com/main.htm Beit Al Quran].&lt;/ref&gt; and one of Bahrain's most important cultural spots, [[La Fontaine Contemporary Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beitalquran.com/main.htm La Fontaine Contemporary Arts Centre].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=11727 La Fontaine Contemporary Arts Centre profile], ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'', Lebanon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from bars and restaurants, the Exhibitions Avenue also houses many business establishments like ''[[Computer World, Bahrain|Computer World]],'' ''Arabian Printing &amp; Publishing Company'', ''Universal Palace'', ''Gulf Computer Services'', "Zainal Mart", "Nesto Supermarket", "Noora Restaurant", Genius Computer" Etc.

The ''GOSI Complex'' is a shopping complex that is also located on Exhibitions Avenue. The ''[[Abu Bakr Siddeeq mosque]]'' is a landmark on Exhibitions Avenue and is located beside the Hoora Police Station. Much of the architecture of Hoora is in the traditional [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] style and dates back to the beginning of the 20th century.

The '''Horror Writers Association''' ('''HWA''') is a worldwide non-profit organization of professional writers and publishing professionals dedicated to promoting the interests of [[Horror fiction|Horror]] and [[Dark fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref name="JoiningHWAname=JoiningHWA"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is The Horror Writer's Association?|url=http://www.horror.org/joinhwa.htm|work=HWA Website|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
HWA was formed in 1985 with the help of many of the field's greats, including [[Joe R. Lansdale]], [[Robert McCammon]], and [[Dean Koontz]], although it was not formally incorporated until 1987, the year it first gave [[Bram Stoker Award]]s. The group was originally called ''HOWL'' (Horror and Occult Writers League), but quickly changed to the ''Horror Writers of America'' when they formally organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror.org/aboutus.htm#wiater|title=Horror Writers Association - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HWA now has members and regional chapters throughout North America, Europe, Australia, South Africa, Russia, and Asia, which led to the current name of the organization.

One of HWA's missions is to encourage public interest in and foster an appreciation of quality [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[dark fantasy]] literature. To that end, HWA offers information on their Web site, they sponsor or take part in occasional public readings and lectures. They also maintain an official presence at many fan-based horror and fantasy conventions, such as the Bram Stoker Awards® Weekend, [[World Fantasy Convention]] and the [[World Horror Convention]].

HWA sponsors the annual [[Bram Stoker Awards]] for superior achievement in [[Horror fiction|Horror]] and [[Dark fantasy]]. HWA also presents an annual Lifetime Achievement Award to as many as three living people who have made significant contributions to the writing of [[Horror fiction|Horror]] and [[Dark fantasy]] over the course of a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror.org/awards/stokers.htm|title=Horror Writers Association - The Bram Stoker Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also a number of service Awards, including the Specialty Press Award and the [[HWA Silver Hammer Award|Silver Hammer Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror.org/awards/hwaawards.htm|title=Horror Writers Association - Bram Stoker Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, HWA has produced a series of [[anthologies]] edited by a few of the more prestigious members and published in hardcover, [[Mass market paperback|mass-market]] or [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] by various publishers. Most have also had signed, [[Limited edition books|limited hardcover editions]]. These anthologies present new stories by the members of the Horror Writers Association. In addition, in 1997 HWA produced a volume of essays on the craft of horror writing, ''On Writing Horror: A Handbook by the Horror Writers Association'', edited by [[Mort Castle]], with contributions from dozens of well-known HWA members. In 2006, an [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1582974209/ updated and revised version] was issued. Their latest series of anthologies, ''Blood Lite'', collects darkly humorous tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWA Books|url=http://www.horror.org/hwabooks.htm|work=HWA Website|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''illustrator''' is an [[artist]] who specializes in enhancing [[writing]] or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The [[illustration]] may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Elster|first=Charles | last2=Simons | first2=Herbert |periodical=The Reading Teacher |volume=39 |issue=2 |year=1985 |title=How important are illustrations in children's readers? |publisher=International Reading Association |pages=148–152 |jstor=20199036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustration is the art of making images that work with something and add to it without needing direct attention and without distracting from what they illustrate. The other thing is the focus of the attention, and the illustration's role is to add personality and character without competing with that other thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/6787/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-illustrator|title=What does it mean to be an illustrator?|website=graphicdesign.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrations have been used in [[advertisement]]s, [[architectural rendering]], [[greeting card]]s, [[poster]]s, [[book]]s, [[graphic novels]], [[storyboards]], [[User guide|manual]]s, [[business]], [[magazine]]s, [[shirts]], [[video games]], [[tutorials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/presentations/illustra/illustrations/illustrations_new.htm|title=Part One: The Instructional Role of Illustrations|work=ucar.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[newspapers]]. A [[cartoon|cartoon illustration]] can add humor to stories or essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandcartoons.com/the-first-recorded-cartoon-illustration-and-animation/|title=The first recorded cartoon illustration and animation|work=Island Cartoons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use reference images to create scenes and characters. This can be as simple as looking at an image to inspire your artwork, or creating character sketches and detailed scenes from different angles to create the basis of a picture book world. Some traditional illustration techniques include [[watercolor]], [[pen and ink]], [[airbrush]] art, [[oil painting]], [[pastel]]s, [[wood engraving]], and [[Linocut|linoleum cuts]]. 

[[John Held, Jr.]] was an illustrator who worked in a variety of styles and media, including linoleum cuts, pen and ink drawings, magazine cover paintings, cartoons, [[comic strip]]s, and set design, while also creating fine art with his animal sculptures and watercolor, many established illustrators attended an art school or college of some sort and were trained in different painting and drawing techniques.

Traditional illustration seems to have made a resurgence in the age of social media thanks to social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Currently traditional and digital illustration are both flourishing.

Universities and art schools offer specific courses in illustration (for example in the UK, a BA (Hons) [[academic degree|Degree]]) so this has become a new avenue into the profession. Many illustrators are [[freelance]], commissioned by publishers (of newspapers, books, or magazines) or advertising agencies. Most [[scientific visualization|scientific illustration]]s and [[technical illustration]]s are also known as [[information graphics]]. Among the information graphics specialists are medical illustrators who illustrate human anatomy, often requiring many years of artistic and medical training.

A particularly popular medium with illustrators of the 1950s and 1960s was [[Casein paint|casein]], as was egg [[tempera]]. The immediacy and durability of these media suited illustration's demands well. The artwork in both types of paint withstood the rigors of travel to clients and printers without damage.

Computer illustration, or digital illustration, is the use of digital tools to produce images under the direct manipulation of the artist, usually through a pointing device, such as a tablet or a mouse.

Computers dramatically changed the industry and today, many cartoonists and illustrators create [[digital illustration]]s using computers, [[graphics tablet]]s, and [[image scanner|scanners]]. Software such as [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], Corel Painter, and Affinity Designer are now widely used by those professionals.

The Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) is a non-political UK registered charity with a mission to promote and preserve the history, languages and cultures of Iran and the Persianate world, covering all periods of Iranian civilization from ancient to modern.

== History and organisation ==

The Iran Heritage Foundation was founded in the UK in 1990 and registered as a charity in 1991 (no. 1001785). It is funded by contributions from individuals and corporations, and through various fundraising events. The Foundation does not accept financial support from any government organisations or lobbying groups. IHF is governed by a body of trustees supported by an advisory board and grant-giving committees.

=== Chairpersons and Directors ===

=== IHF America ===
In 2010 IHF established an independent parallel organisation in the USA known as IHF America. This organisation supported a curatorial post at the Freer Sackler gallery in Washington DC and played a major role in the British Museum’s tour of the Cyrus Cylinder exhibition to five different US venues in 2013.

== Object / Remit ==

The remit of IHF is wide and includes archaeology, history, art history, literature, the performing arts, film, photography, music and contemporary art. IHF achieves its objectives by organising and supporting exhibitions, cultural events and conferences, giving grants, sponsoring publications, and supporting posts in universities and museums. Cultural/educational institutions that have been supported by IHF include the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Exeter, London, Oxford, Reading, and St Andrews, and the British Library, the British Museum, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Tate Modern, and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.

== Activities ==

The Foundation organises a regular series of events including lectures, panel discussions, performances, and film screenings. Major international conferences organised by IHF include: ‘Iran's Natural Heritage’ (2014); ‘From Persepolis to Isfahan: Safeguarding Cultural Heritage’ (2015); and two conferences on Tappeh Sialk and ancient Kashan (2017, 2018). 

IHF also awards annual grants for academic and scholarly research as well as for contemporary and performing arts projects and festivals. These grants are awarded by two separate committees made up of external advisors.

IHF supports and sponsors events and activities which promote Iranian culture and history, including exhibitions such as ‘Forgotten Empire’ and ‘Shah Abbas’ at the British Museum in 2005 and 2009. Additionally, the 2013 exhibition ‘The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia’, which toured around the US, was organised by the British Museum in partnership with the Iran Heritage Foundation and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. An ongoing major project supported by the IHF is the Golha Archive, an online digitized and fully indexed archive of the Golha radio programmes broadcast on Iranian National Radio from 1956 until 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8953">{{Muhammad}}

Very few texts in [[Judaism]] refer to or take note of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. Those that do, generally reject Muhammad's proclamation of receiving divine revelations from [[God]] and label him instead as a [[false prophet]].

==Background==
In Judaism, prophets were seen as having attained the highest degree of holiness, scholarship, and closeness to God and set the standards for human perfection. The [[Talmud]] reports that there were more than a million prophets, but most of the prophets conveyed messages that were intended solely for their own generation and were not reported in [[Scripture]]. The Talmud reports that there were prophets among the [[gentile]]s (most notably [[Balaam]], whose story is told in ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]'' 22, and [[Job (Bible)|Job]], who is considered a non-Jew by most rabbinical opinions). The prophet [[Jonah]] was sent on a mission to speak to the gentiles of the city of [[Nineveh]].

==References to Muhammad==

In the Middle Ages, it was common for [[Jews|Jewish]] writers to describe Muhammad as ''ha-meshuggah'' ("the [[madman]]"), a term of contempt frequently used in the Bible for those who believe themselves to be prophets.&lt;ref name="Stillman1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman A. Stillman|title=The Jews of Arab lands: a history and source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=26 December 2011|year=1979|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=978-0-8276-0198-7|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M8o6UZ37ppUC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism By Ibn Warraq Page 255]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vjFNPT52XjUC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History page 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporaries===
In the 7th century and during the life of Muhammad himself, many Jewish leaders and individual Jews made public their views on him or those who followed, especially but not limited if it concerned their communities. Among others, the old sage and man of letters [[Abu 'Afak]] from the Ubaeda tribe who wrote a poem which would be indicted by Muhammad himself, as warranting the capital sentence by [[assassination]]. The extant of it was preserved in Islamic biography and it may have been less severe,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Long have I lived but never have I seen
An assembly or collection of people
More faithful to their undertaking
And their allies when called upon
Than the sons of Qayla when they assembled,
Men who overthrew mountains and never submitted.
A rider who came to them split them in two
(saying) "Permitted", "Forbidden", of all sorts of things.
Had you believed in glory or kingship
You would have followed [[Rulers of Saba and Himyar|Tubba]].

The apostle [Muhammad] said, "Who will deal with this rascal for me?"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Maimonides===
[[Maimonides]] referred to Muhammad as a [[false prophet]] and an [[insane]] man. In his ''[[Epistle to Yemen]]'' he wrote "After [Jesus] arose the Madman who emulated his precursor [Jesus], since he paved the way for him. But he added the further objective of procuring rule and submission [''talb al-mulk''; pursuit of sovereignty] and he invented what was well known [Islam]."&lt;ref name=Roth1994p218&gt;Norman Roth. ''Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict'', [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 1994, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his authoritative work of law the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12), Maimonides indicated that nevertheless Muhammad was part of God's plan of preparing the world for the coming of the [[Jewish Messianism|Jewish Messiah]]: "All those words of Jesus of Nazareth and of this Ishmaelite [i.e., Muhammad] who arose after him are only to make straight the path for the messianic king and to prepare the whole world to serve the Lord together. As it is said: 'For then I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech so that all of them shall call on the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord' (Zephaniah 3:9)."&lt;ref name=Rudin128-129&gt;[[A. James Rudin]]. ''Christians &amp; Jews Faith to Faith: Tragic History, Promising Present, Fragile Future'', Jewish Lights Publishing, 2010, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natan'el al-Fayyumi===
[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], a prominent 12th-century [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] rabbi and theologian, and the founder of what is sometimes called "[[Jewish philosophy#Nethan'el al-Fayyumi|Jewish Ismailism]]", wrote in his philosophical treatise ''Bustan al-Uqul'' ("Garden of Wisdom") that God sends prophets to establish religions for other nations, which do not have to conform to the precepts of the Jewish Torah. Nethanel explicitly considered Muhammad a true prophet, who was sent from Heaven with a particular message that applies to the Arabs, but not to the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bustan al-Ukul, by Nathanael ibn al-Fayyumi,'' edited and translated by David Levine, Columbia University Oriental Studies Vol. VI, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gan ha-Sekhalim'', ed. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1984), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al-Fayymi's explicit acceptance of Muhammad's prophecy was rare and virtually unknown until recent times beyond his native [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation,'' by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter,  T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-08161-3}}, p. 137 ''Netanel's work was virtually unknown beyond his native Yemen until modern times, so had little influence on later Jewish thought.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midrash===
The [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] [[Midrash]] ''Secrets (Nistarot) of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai'', compares Muhammad, "a prophet sent to [[Ishmael]] according to God's will", to the Jewish [[Jewish eschatology|Messiah]]. According to this text, ascribed to the famous 1st-century sage and mystic [[Simeon bar Yochai]], and apparently written at the beginning of the Muslim conquest or in the 8th century,&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Jerusalem: The Early Muslim Period'', by Joshua Prawer and Haggai Ben-Shammai, NYU Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0814766392}}, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's role as a prophet includes redeeming the Jews from the Christian ("Roman" or "Edomite") oppression and playing a positive role in the messianic process.&lt;ref&gt;''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation,'' by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter,  T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-08161-3}}, p. 133 ''"Nistarot" places the Muslim conquests in an eschatological context, and implies that Muhammad had a positive role to play in the messianic process.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obscure and indirect references===
One Yemenite Jewish document, found in the [[Cairo Genizah]], suggests that many Jews had not only accepted Muhammad as a prophet, but even desecrated [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] in order to join Muhammad in his struggle. However, some historians suggest that this document, called ''Dhimmat an-nabi Muhammad'' (Muhammad’s Writ of Protection), has been fabricated by Yemenite Jews for the purpose of self-defence.&lt;ref&gt;Yakov Rabkin [http://www.cismor.jp/en/publication/jismor/documents/JISMOR5en_Rabkin.pdf "Perspectives on the Muslim Other in Jewish Tradition"] (126&amp;nbsp;KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of stories from the Islamic tradition about Muhammad entered mainstream Jewish thought incidentally, due to the great cultural convergence in Islamic Spain from the 9th to 12th centuries, known as the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden Age]] of [[Sephardim|Spanish Jewry]]. For example, Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]], one of the early [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] mystics, wrote that one pious man (''hasid'') taught that the internal struggle against the evil inclination is greater than external battle, quoting [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]'s popular treatise ''[[Chovot HaLevavot]].'' In the [[Judeo-Arabic]] original version of that book, Bahya Ibn Paquda refers to both external and internal battle as [[jihad]] and the "pious man" about whom the story is originally told is Muhammad, though the author does not mention his source by name.&lt;ref&gt;''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart,'' by Diana Lobel, University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|0-8122-3953-9}}, p. ix "How does a perennially popular manual of Jewish piety come to be quoting Islamic traditions about the Prophet Muhammad? Muslim Spain of the tenth through twelfth century, known as the "Golden Age" of Hispano-Jewish poetry and letters, is a time of great convergence and cultural creativity."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photograph of La Memoria De Nuestra Tierra .jpg|thumb|A photograph of Judy Baca's La Memoria De Nuestra Tierra (California 1996) as seen in USC's graduate student union.]]
'''''La Memoria De Nuestra Tierra: California 1996''''' is an 10&amp;nbsp;ft x 30&amp;nbsp;ft rectangular mural, currently located in the [[University of Southern California]]'s Graduate Student Lounge within the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.&lt;ref&gt;Baca, Judy. ''La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra: California 1996''. December 1996. Mural, 18’ x  9’. University of Southern California Tutor Campus Center, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; The mural was painted by artist [[Judy Baca]] in collaboration with students from the University's Roski School of Art and Design. This piece shows the [[Chicano history]] of [[Southern California]] through the depiction of various images inspired by the native history of the land and the more modern conflicts and issues Latinos have suffered.

== History==

''La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra'' was commissioned by the University in July 1995 and dedicated on December 5, 1996.

The creation of the mural was sparked by a number of concerns and demands made by Latino and Chicano students during the 1993-1994 academic year. The University received 45 different submissions before choosing Baca, who was widely known for the creation of “The Great Wall of Los Angeles.” The mural was installed in USC’s Student Center in August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/12390/Formal-Dedication-for-The-Memory-of-Our-Land-at-Topping-Student-Center-Draws-Crowd-Despite-Rain/|title=Formal Dedication for "The Memory of Our Land" at Topping Student Center Draws Crowd Despite Rain - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baca’s mural was then rededicated on Sept. 30, 2010 at the grand opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/27958/Grand-Opening-for-Tutor-Campus-Center-Art/|title=Grand Opening for Tutor Campus Center Art - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra'' translates to English as ''The Memory of Our Land''. As its name suggests, the piece was created to celebrate Latino and, more specifically, Chicano culture and influence at The University of Southern California and in Los Angeles.  The mural depicts central aspects of Mexican culture and religion, such as the Kiva, as well as instances and actors that played key roles in the interconnection between Mexican and American culture, such as the conquistadors and the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/20156/Latina-artist-to-paint-Topping-Center-mural-on-Chicano-themes/|title=Latina artist to paint Topping Center mural on Chicano themes - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baca also created a mural under the same name that is currently on display at Denver International Airport. This mural, however, is more personal, depicting her grandparents journey from Mexico to Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baca|first=Judy|date=2005|title="La Memoria De Nuestra Tierra: Colorado."|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/search/article?option1=tka&amp;value1=la+memoria+de+nuestra+tierra&amp;pageSize=10&amp;index=1#|journal=Aztlan: A Journal of Chicano Studies|volume=30:1|pages=195|via=Ingenta Connect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important elements ==
[[File:Photograph of La Memoria De Nuestra Tierra Kiva.jpg|thumb|Baca's depiction of a Kiva.]]

=== Kiva ===
The [[Kiva]], a Native American ceremonial structure, is the central image of the Mural. This represents the native, religious and nurturing characteristics of Latino and Chicano culture. Based on this idea of the caring nature of the culture, the river flows from the kiva and onto the land,  eventually turning into a paved road on the U.S side of the border, signaling the difference in culture. Corn also grows around the structure of the Kiva, supporting the idea of the Kiva as a provider of nutritional, religious and cultural nourishment for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/12397/An-Iconographic-Roadmap-to-the-Mural/|title=An Iconographic Roadmap to the Mural - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kivas, which can be built above or below ground, were used for both religious and day-to-day domestic activities depending on the community that was utilizing them. Smaller Kivas often served as single-person homes, while those that were solely used for ritual purposes tended to be larger than multi-use structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Michael|date=1993|title="Why Is a Kiva? New Interpretations of Prehistoric Social Integrative Architecture in the Northern Rio Grande Region of New Mexico."|url=https://www.jstor.org.libproxy1.usc.edu/stable/pdf/3630153.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:7d5b943232b7d447bf287e983111d466|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|volume=49:4|pages=319–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Photograph of La Memoria De Nuestra Tierra Conquistadors.jpg|thumb|Conquistador's helmet as seen in the mural.]]

=== Conquistadors ===
At the center-right of the mural, on the Mexican side of the land, there is an illustration of a conquistador’s head. The image of the conquistador has a helmet painted near the workers and activists that are depicted on the right edge of the mural. The conquistador is depicted as an illustration because there was a time during colonization when all people spoke different languages, making illustrations the chosen mode of communication over verbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.judybaca.com/artist/judy-baca-news/judy-baca-mural-rededication/|title=Judy Baca Mural Rededication {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|website=www.judybaca.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conquistadors are major players in Latino history, making the way that the conquistador is depicted in Baca’s work very important in understanding the Latino/Chicano experience. As mentioned above, the conquistador is "stamped" near the workers and the man running at the border, which is supposed to show these men’s ever-present nature on this land and their need to claim control over it and the native people because they had different cultures and practices that were misunderstood as that of “savages.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bárbaros Spaniards and Their Savages in the Age of Enlightenment.|last=Weber|first=David J.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra boarder.jpg|thumb|Baca's illustration of the U.S.-Mexico border.]]

=== U.S.-Mexico border ===
The U.S-Mexico border is clearly marked in the mural by a flowing river turning into a paved road, as previously mentioned, and it is easy to see the contrast of the two lands because the Mexican side is untouched or underdeveloped, while the U.S side shows development, crops, and greenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/12397/An-Iconographic-Roadmap-to-the-Mural/|title=An Iconographic Roadmap to the Mural - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger meaning behind this mural is a sort of celebration of the importance of the land. On the far right of the mural we see a sleeping woman that wakes up displeased to realize that the border has become a part of her. Also on the far right, at the front of the line of workers, there is a man wearing a hoodie who is running from immigration officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.judybaca.com/artist/judy-baca-news/judy-baca-mural-rededication/|title=Judy Baca Mural Rededication {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|website=www.judybaca.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these elements depict the history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the culture of migration across it. Mexican migrants and workers are often synonyms of criminality for border agents even though most people cross the border for economic and social reasons, searching for a better life in a land that once was their own, while still maintaining a strong connection to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Tamar|date=2010|title="The Culture of Mexican Migration."|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0308275X10382728|journal=Critique of Anthropology|volume=30:4|pages=399–420|via=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra activists.jpg|thumb|Image of Chicano Activists in the mural.]]

=== &lt;small&gt;Chicano activists&lt;/small&gt; ===
In the lower right corner of the mural, Baca depicts many artists and activists among the Chicano community. These activists include David Alfaro Siqueiros, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, the United Farm Workers, and the Chicano Moratorium.

[[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] (1896–1974) was a Mexican artist and activist. Siqueiros painted many murals and helped begin the mural movement in Mexico. He engaged in political activism through his art as well as in his day-to-day life, particularly democracy and workers’ rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography|last=|first=|publisher=Gale|year=2004|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frida Kahlo]] (1907–1954) was a Mexican artist and activist. Kahlo stood up for many social justice issues both physically and through her art. Her art includes messages of Mexican nationalism, Marxism, and feminism. She also protested US intervention in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/727361631/fmt/ai/rep/SPDF?cit%3Aauth=Fernandez%2C+Lorena+Beatriz&amp;cit%3Atitle=An+exporation+and+analysis+of+the+sociological+content+in+the+art+of+...&amp;cit%3Apub=ProQuest+Dissertations+and+Theses&amp;cit%3Avol=&amp;cit%3Aiss=&amp;cit%3Apg=&amp;cit%3Adate=2001&amp;ic=true&amp;cit%3Aprod=ProQuest&amp;_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYg%3D%3D&amp;_s=rIa%2BVE52Q2umASUHV%2FwGpOqQM4A%3D|title=An exporation and analysis of the sociological content in the art of Frida Kahlo: Mexican ethnic and cultural identity, feminism, the struggle of the disable and her political ideology|last=Fernandez|first=Lorena Beatriz|date=2001|website=Protest Dissertations Publishing|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Rivera]] (1886–1957) was a Mexican artist and activist. His art is very political, and through it he has supported the Mexican Revolution and the socialist revolution while condemning colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vazquez|first=Adolfo Sanchez|date=July 15, 2014|title=Diego Rivera: Painting and Partisanship|url=|journal=Third Text|volume=|pages=269–270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cesar Chavez]] (1927–1993) and the United Farm Workers were Mexican-American activists who protested farm workers’ treatments and advocated for their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Cesar E. Chavez and the United Farm Workers|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2011|work=El Chicano Weekly|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chicano Moratorium]] was an anti-Vietnam War protest that occurred in Los Angeles, California on August 29, 1970. The demonstration included approximately 30,000 Mexican-American activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sk.sagepub.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/reference/multicultural-america/n176.xml?term=chicano%20moratorium|title=Chicano Moratorium|last=Green|first=Susan Marie|date=|website=Sage Knowledge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra Los Ranchos.jpg|thumb|Baca's illustration of Los Ranchos.]]

=== &lt;small&gt;Los ranchos&lt;/small&gt; ===
On the upper part of the mural, Baca paints the los ranchos. The ranchos were occupied by Mexican settlers before the 1870s. Some ranchos Baca depicts are Rancho La Cienega, Palos Verdes, Los Verdugos, Santiago de Santa Ana, La Ballona and San Fernando.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.judybaca.com/artist/judy-baca-news/judy-baca-mural-rededication/|title=Judy Baca Mural Rededication {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|website=www.judybaca.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This land is typically viewed as a symbol of Hispanic California. The ranchos are often romanticized and viewed with a sense of nostalgia by many Hispanics. The land is reminiscent of a time before European-American settlers occupied and colonized the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornbeck|first=David|date=1978|title=Land tenure and rancho expansion in Alta California|url=|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|volume=4|pages=371–390|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra Sonora town.jpg|thumb|Baca's depiction of the deteriorating houses of Sonora Town.]]

=== &lt;small&gt;Sonora Town&lt;/small&gt; ===

The left portion of the mural features the image of the deteriorating houses which represent Sonora Town. Sonora Town is referred to as Los Angeles’ first predominately Spanish-speaking neighborhood, or barrio, and has seen a variety of changing populations throughout the course of history. All of Sonora Town’s inhabits have faced various social and economic issues that plagued the barrio. Following its initial development in 1899, the people of Sonora Town suffered extreme poverty, crime, and hazardous environments while receiving little aid or recognition from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Griswold del Castillo, Richard. ''The Los Angeles Barrio, 1850-1890''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The decrepit houses of Sonora Town illustrated in Baca’s mural call attention to the state of California’s neglect of this population of Spanish-speaking individuals.
[[File:La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra silver dollar.jpg|thumb|The image of the soldier and "The Silver Dollar" text as seen in the mural.]]

=== &lt;small&gt;Silver Dollar Bar&lt;/small&gt; ===

In the mural, an image of a soldier is located along the illustration of a river. The soldier is labeled with the title “The Silver Dollar”, referencing the Silver Dollar Bar, which played a significant role in sparking the Chicano Movement of the 1970s. The Silver Dollar Bar marks the location when Chicano activist and journalist Ruben Salazar was murdered in an act of police brutality. The death of Salazar marked the official beginning of the Chicano Movement in Los Angeles and inspired Mexican Americans to actively protest violent police behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Escobar|first=Edward J.|date=1993|title=The Dialectics of Repression: The Los Angeles Police Department and the Chicano Movement, 1968-1971|jstor=2080213|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=79|issue=4|pages=1483–1514|doi=10.2307/2080213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baca’s reference to the Silver Dollar Bar in the mural recognizes the history of police brutality against Mexican Americans and pays homage to the efforts of Chicano protestors who advocated for a safer and more just future.
[[File:La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra missions.jpg|thumb|The illustration of two Chumash people and native corpses in the distance.]]

=== &lt;small&gt;Santa Barbara missions&lt;/small&gt; ===

Two Chumash people are illustrated in the lower left corner of Baca’s mural. These individuals represent the near extinction of a native people due to the intervention of colonists. The Chumash were native individuals of the California coast whose population and culture were greatly disturbed by European intervention and colonization. With the Santa Barbara missions came oppression, murder, and unbearable living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dartt-Newton|first=Deana|last2=Erlandson|first2=Jon M.|date=2006|title=Little Choice for the Chumash: Colonialism, Cattle, and Coercion in Mission Period California|jstor=4139021|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=30|issue=3/4|pages=416–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions allowed for the vast spread of disease, including dysentery syphilis, which drastically increased mortality rates and led to over a 50% decrease in the Chumash population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JACKSON|first=ROBERT H.|date=1990|title=The Population of the Santa Barbara Channel Missions (Alta California), 1813-1832|jstor=27825426|journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=268–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baca symbolizes this widespread genocide with the depiction of Chumash corpus in the lower left of the mural.

[[File:Spleen et ideal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Spleen et idéal'', by [[Carlos Schwabe]], 1907]]
'''''Le Spleen de Paris''''', also known as '''''Paris Spleen''''' or '''''Petits Poèmes en prose''''', is a collection of 50 short [[prose poetry|prose poems]] by [[Charles Baudelaire]]. The collection was published posthumously in 1869 and is associated with [[literary modernism]].

Baudelaire mentions he had read [[Aloysius Bertrand]]'s ''[[Gaspard de la Nuit (book)|Gaspard de la nuit]]'' (considered the first example of prose poetry) at least twenty times before starting this work. Though inspired by Bertrand, Baudelaire's prose poems were based on Parisian contemporary life instead of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] background which Bertrand employed. He said of his work: "These are [[Les Fleurs du mal|the flowers of evil]] again, but with more freedom, much more detail, and much more mockery." Indeed, many of the themes and even titles from Baudelaire's earlier collection ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' are revisited in this work.

These poems have no particular order, have no beginning and no end and they can be read like thoughts or short stories in a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] style. The point of the poems is "to capture the beauty of life in the modern city," using what [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] has labeled as being his [[Existentialism|existential]] outlook on his surroundings.

Published twenty years after the fratricidal [[June Days uprising|June Days]] that ended the ideal or "brotherly" [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]], Baudelaire makes no attempts at trying to reform society he has grown up in but realizes the inequities of the progressing modernization of Paris. In poems such as "The Eyes of the Poor" where he writes (after witnessing an impoverished family looking in on a new cafe): "Not only was I moved by that family of eyes, but I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and decanters, larger than our thirst...", showing his feelings of despair and class guilt.

The title of the work refers not to the abdominal organ (the [[spleen]]) but rather to the second, more literary meaning of the word, "melancholy with no apparent cause, characterised by a disgust with everything".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from ''Le Nouveau Petit Robert 2009''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major themes in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' ==

=== Pleasure ===
''Le Spleen de Paris'' explores the idea of pleasure as a vehicle for expressing emotion. Many of the poems refer to sex or sin explicitly (i.e. "Double Bedroom," "A Hemisphere in a Head of Hair", "Temptations"); others use subtle language and imagery to evoke sensuality (i.e. "the Artist's Confiteor"). In both cases, the diction is undeniably sexual; for example, in "Double Bedroom", "Muslin rains abundantly over the windows and around the bed in a snowy cascade. Within this bed is ensconced the Idol, queen of dreams."{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=9}} Baudelaire's obsession with pleasure reflects his love for scandal and wickedness, as well as his philosophy that by seeking pleasure, man taps into his authentic "evil" self.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Joanna. Baudelaire. St. Martin's Press: New York, 1994. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sobriety and intoxication ===
Many of Baudelaire's prose poems openly advocate drinking and intoxication, such as "Be Drunk". Intoxication (or any equal pleasure such as creative work, sex, virtue, etc.) creates a euphoria and timelessness that allows you to transcend the limitations of time and truly live "in the moment". In "Be Drunk", the speaker commands the reader to engage in something intoxicating: "You must be drunk always... Time crushes your shoulders and bends you earthward, you must be drunk without respite."{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=71}} Sobriety, in contrast, forces you to address the harsh realities of the world around you. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by some critics, who claim that Baudelaire was actually being ironic in his advocacy for drunkenness. Maria Scott, a literary scholar, claims that Baudelaire believed "artificial toxication was ... far inferior to 'successive work' and the 'regular exercise of will', that artificial stimulants ... actually ''amplify'' time."{{sfn|Scott|2005|pp=196–197}} Thus, it is debatable whether intoxication refers to literal drunkenness as an escape or if symbolizes the pleasure found in writing and expressing oneself.

=== The artist/poet ===
In ''Le Spleen de Paris'', the concept of artist and poet intermingle. Baudelaire saw poetry as a form of art, and thus in many of the prose poems the artist is a substitute for a traditional poet or speaker. In "The Desire to Paint", the artist attempts to depict his beautiful muse with images, just as the poet attempts to express his emotions with language. The relationship between the artist and poet reflects the need to evoke a particular feeling or idea, and this thread is carried through almost every single poem in the text. Ultimately, the artist and the poet become one, since they share the same purpose – to describe beauty. In this sense, the work itself (and every individual poem within) is beautiful, a "work of art" due to its innovative, interesting form. Thus, the poem, according to Baudelaire, is as much an "aesthetic experience" as it is a literary one.&lt;ref&gt;Hiddleston, J. A. ''Baudelaire and Le Spleen de Paris''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Women are both admired and ridiculed in ''Le Spleen de Paris''. Some poems, such as "The Desire to Paint", reflect female power and sexuality in a somewhat positive manner. However, a larger portion of the poems in Baudelaire's work debase women as evil, gaudy, and cold. Many are represented as prostitutes, and according to scholars, "the courtesan would seem to be a virtual incarnation, for Baudelaire, of all that is artificial and misleading."{{sfn|Scott|2005|p=54}} In "The Rope", the speaker's apprentice hangs himself, and his mother comes to collect the rope. The speaker is shocked to discover that she did so not to "preserve them as horrible and precious relics", but to sell them for a morbid profit.{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|pp=62–64}} Baudelaire rejects the concept of maternal love and replaces it with a cold economic reality. Still, women are inherently sexual, and in some regards, Baudelaire admires their sensual beauty (connects back to themes of intoxication, pleasure).

=== Mortality and the passage of time ===
Many of Baudelaire's prose poems are dominated by the concept of time, usually negatively. The speaker in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' fears the passage of time and his/her own mortality. As a result, intoxication, women, pleasure, and writing are all forms of escape from this unavoidable hell. "Be Drunk" and "Already!" exemplify Baudelaire's infatuation with the idea of time. In "Already!" the speaker is incapable of matching the infiniteness and simplicity of nature, and at the end, comes face to face with his own death: "I felt pulled down deathwards; which is why, when companions said, 'At last!' I could only cry, '''Already!''"{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=73}} Also, this theme supports Baudelaire's admiration of art and poetry because although man cannot defeat time and death, a work of art can. Art, poetry, life, and death are inextricably linked within Baudelaire's poems, and perhaps reflect a personal obsession with mortality.

===The city===
For Baudelaire, the setting of most poems within ''Le Spleen de Paris'' is the Parisian metropolis, specifically the poorer areas within the city. Notable poems within ''Le Spleen de Paris'' whose urban setting is important include “Crowds” and “The Old Mountebank.” Within his writing about city life, Baudelaire seems to stress the relationship between individual and society, frequently placing the speaker in a reflective role looking out at the city. It is also important to note that Baudelaire's Paris is not one of nice shops and beautiful streets. Instead, Baudelaire focuses on dirty, poverty-stricken areas of Paris with social problems rather than the Paris of the upper class.

===Poverty/class===
In connection with the theme of the Parisian metropolis, Baudelaire focuses heavily on the theme of poverty and social class within ''Le Spleen de Paris''. Important poems from the collection which embody these themes include "The Toy of the Poor", "The Eyes of the Poor", "Counterfeit Money", and "Let's Beat Up the Poor". In these poems Baudelaire introduces slightly differing views of the urban poor. In "The Toy of the Poor" Baudelaire heavily stresses the need for equality between social classes in Paris. In comparison, "Counterfeit Money" and "Let's Beat Up the Poor" seem to use a sarcastic tone to instil empathy in the reader for those people in poverty. In [[Michael Hamburger]]'s introduction to his translation, ''Twenty Prose Poems of Baudelaire'', the scholar notes a highly sympathetic view of the poor in ''Le Spleen de Paris''; Baudelaire seems to relate to the poor and becomes an advocate for them in his poetry.{{sfn|Hamburger|1946|pp=vii–xii}}

===Religion/good vs. evil===
Many poems in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' incorporate a central theme of religion or the relationship between good and evil in human nature. "Cake", which centers on a moral battle addressing the question of whether humans are inherently good or evil stands out as an especially important poem within the collection. "Loss of a Halo" also incorporates similar themes, literally discussing the role of angels as well as the relationship between mankind and religious ideology, questioning the goodness of Christian ideals. Along these lines, Baudelaire repeatedly addresses the theme of sin within his poetry as well as questioning how the hierarchy of class could affect the hierarchy of goodness, implying that those of higher social class tend not to be morally superior to those of lower classes. Many critics of Baudelaire address the prominent role of religion in the poet's life and how that might have affected his writing. Some suspect that since Baudelaire internalized Christian practices, he thought himself capable of accurately portraying God in his writing. Yet by representing God's message within his poetry, Baudelaire placed himself in a position of patriarchal authority, similar to that of the God depicted in Christianity.

==Poet/reader relationship==
The following passage is taken from the preface to the 2008 Mackenzie translation of ''Le Spleen de Paris'', entitled "To Arsène Houssaye":

{{quote|My dear friend, I send you here a little work of which no one could say that it has neither head nor tail, because, on the contrary, everything in it is both head and tail, alternately and reciprocally. Please consider what fine advantages this combination offers to all of us, to you, to me, and to the reader. We can cut whatever we like—me, my reverie, you, the manuscript, and the reader, his reading; for I don't tie the impatient reader up in the endless thread of a superfluous plot. Pull out one of the vertebrae, and the two halves of this tortuous fantasy will rejoin themselves painlessly. Chop it up into numerous fragments, and you'll find that each one can live on its own. In the hopes that some of these stumps will be lively enough to please and amuse you, I dedicate the entire serpent to you.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=3}}}}

While writing ''Le Spleen de Paris'', Baudelaire made very conscious decisions regarding his relationship with his readers. As seen in the preface to the collection, addressed to his publisher, Arsène Houssaye, Baudelaire attempted to write a text that was very accessible to a reader while pulling the most appealing aspects of both prose and poetry and combining them into the revolutionary genre of prose poetry. For Baudelaire, the accessibility of the text and ability for a reader to set down the book and pick it up much later was crucial, especially considering his implied opinions of his readers. Baudelaire's tone throughout the preface, "The Dog and the Vial" as well as other poems throughout ''Le Spleen de Paris'' seem to illustrate Baudelaire's opinions of superiority over his readers. In "The Dog and the Vial", a man offers his dog a vial of fancy perfume to smell and the dog reacts in horror, instead wishing to sniff more seemingly unappealing smells, specifically excrement. The poem concludes with the frustration of the speaker with his dog, expressed as the speaker states: "In this respect you, unworthy companion of my sad life, resemble the public, to whom one must never present the delicate scents that only exasperate them, but instead give them only dung, chosen with care".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=14}} One can extrapolate this poem to apply more figuratively to the larger themes of the poet-reader relationship, in which Baudelaire deprecates his readers, viewing them as unintelligent and incapable of appreciating his work.

== Style ==
''Le Spleen de Paris'' represents a definitive break from traditional poetic forms. The text is composed of "prose poems" which span the continuum between "prosaic" and "poetic" works. The new, unconventional form of poetry was characteristic of the modernist movement occurring throughout Europe (and particularly in Paris) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marshall. "Baudelaire: Modernism in the Streets." ''All that is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Penguin Group Inc., 1988. 148. Google Books. 2009. 21 May 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mox1ywiyhtgC&amp;printsec=frontcover books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to ''Le Spleen de Paris'', Baudelaire describes that modernity requires a new language, "a miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and striking enough to suit lyrical movements of the soul, undulations of reverie, the flip-flops of consciousness", and in this sense, ''Le Spleen de Paris'' gives life to modern language.{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=3}} Baudelaire's prose poetry tends to be more poetic in comparison to later works such as Ponge's [[Le parti pris des choses]], but each poem varies. For an example of a more poetic poem, see "Evening Twilight"; for a prosaic example, see "The Bad Glazier".

== Publication history, influences, and critical reception ==
Baudelaire's ''Le Spleen de Paris'' is unique in that it was published posthumously by his sister in 1869, two years after Baudelaire died. In fact, it was not until his waning years, plagued by physical ailments and the contraction of syphilis that he created a table of contents for the book. Baudelaire spent years 1857 to 1867 working on his book of poems that chronicled daily life in the city of Paris. These poems aimed at capturing the times in which they were written, from the brutally repressed upheavals of 1848 (after which the government censored literature more than ever), the 1851 ''coup d'état'' of Louis Bonaparte and generally Paris of the 1850s, demolished and renovated by Napoleon III's prefect, Baron Haussman. In displaying the social antagonisms of the age, Baudelaire drew influence from many great artists of the time. In fact, an active critical essayist himself, his critical reviews of other poets "elucidate the recesses of the mind that created ''Les Fleurs du Mal'' and ''Le Spleen de Paris''."

'''Influence:''' While there is much speculation regarding direct influence and inspiration in the creation of ''Le Spleen de Paris'', the following colleagues seem to have clearly influenced the book of small poems:

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]: "Indeed, Poe illustrates his claim with several examples which seem to summarize with uncanny precision the temperament of Baudelaire himself (Poe 273–4).{{Incomplete short citation|date=August 2018}} The affinity between the two writers in this regard seems beyond dispute ... Moreover, 'Le Démon de la perversité' is less a tale than a prose poem, and both its subject-matter and its movement from general considerations to specific examples leading to an unexpected conclusion may have influenced Baudelaire in his creation of ''Le Spleen de Paris''."

Aloysius Betrand's ''Gaspard de la nuit'': Baudelaire himself is quoted as citing this work as an inspiration for ''Paris Spleen''.

Gustave Flaubert: Magazine article "No ideas but in Crowds: Baudelaire's ''Paris Spleen''" cites similarities between the writers in that like Baudelaire, Flaubert held the same motives and intentions in that he too wanted "to write the moral history of the men of my generation – or, more accurately, the history of their feelings."

'''Critical reception:''' The way in which the poem was received certainly lends to understanding the climate in which Baudelaire created ''Le Spleen de Paris'', in that "It appears to be almost a diary entry, an explicit rundown of the day's events; those events seem to be precisely the kind that Charles Baudelaire would have experienced in the hectic and hypocritical world of the literary marketplace of his day."

Notable critical reception: In order to truly understand how ''Le Spleen de Paris'' was received, one must first be acquainted with Baudelaire's earlier works. The repressions and upheavals of 1848 resulted in massive censorship of literature, which did not bode well for Baudelaire's perhaps most famous work, ''Les Fleurs du Mal''. Society was so shocked by the satanic references and sexual perversion in the book that at the time it was a critical and popular failure. This put the anticipated reception of ''Le Spleen de Paris'' at a disadvantage. Like ''Flowers of Evil'', it wasn't until much later that ''Paris Spleen'' was fully appreciated for what it was, a masterpiece that "brought the style of the prose poem to the broader republics of the people". That being said, just four years after Arthur Rimbaud used Baudelaire's work as a foundation for his poems, as he considered Baudelaire a great poet and pioneer of prose.

'''Appearance in Media:''' A 2006 film ''Spleen'', written by Eric Bomba-Ire, borrowed its title from Baudelaire's book of prose poems. Baudelaire expressed a particular feeling that he called 'Spleen' which is a mixture of melancholy, rage, eros, and resignation, which ties in well with the movie's darkly woven tale of love, betrayal and passion.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0816659|Spleen|(2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable quotations==
{{importance section|date=April 2013}}
In "Let us beat up the poor", Baudelaire makes up a parable about economic and social equality: no one is entitled to it; it belongs to those who can win it and keep it. And he taunts the social reformer: "What do you think of that, Proudhon?"{{sfn|Hill|2006|p=36}}

"At One in the Morning" is like a diary entry, a rundown of the day's events. In it, Baudelaire recognizes that he is part of a society full of hypocrites. His individual self becomes "blurred...by a hypocrisy and perverseness which progressively undermine the difference between the self and others." This is at least partly what Baudelaire meant by "a modern and more abstract life."{{sfn|Hill|2006}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}

"The Thyrsus" is a piece addressed to composer [[Franz Liszt]]. The ancient Greek thyrsus had connotations of "unleashed sexuality and violence, of the profound power of the irrational." Baudelaire believed the thyrsus to be an acceptable object of representation for Liszt's music.

In "The Bad Windowpane Maker" Baudelaire speaks of a "kind of energy that springs from ennui and reverie" that manifests itself in a particularly unexpected way in the most inactive dreamers. Doctors and moralists alike are at a loss to explain where such mad energy so suddenly comes from to these lazy people, why they suddenly feel the need to perform such absurd and dangerous deeds.{{sfn|Hill|2006|p=56}}

The prefatory letter Baudelaire wrote to Arsene Houssaye, the editor of ''La Presse'', was not necessarily intended to be included in the publication. When Baudelaire drew up his table of contents for the projected book form, he did not include the letter. It is possible, then, that the letter only appeared in ''La Presse'' as a means of flattery to ensure that Houssaye would publish the poems.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=xiii}} Nevertheless, it allows us to understand Baudelaire's thinking about the genre of prose poetry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Who among us has not dreamed, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and jarring enough to be adapted to the soul's lyrical movements, the undulations of reverie, to the twists and turns that consciousness takes?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Please replace this with a better definition, but so far as I can tell the midlist is the list, most often a list of books from a publisher, that have been determined to do okay, but not be their bestsellers. So a midlist author would be someone who constantly writes books that are almost the at the top of the list, but not quite.
--&gt;
'''Midlist''' is a term in the [[publishing industry]] which refers to [[book]]s which are not [[bestseller]]s but are strong enough to economically justify their publication (and likely, further purchases of future books from the same [[author]]). The vast majority of total titles published are midlist titles, though they represent a much smaller fraction of total book sales, which are dominated by bestsellers and other very popular titles.

Authors who consistently publish acceptable but not bestselling books are referred to as '''Midlist authors'''.

== United States ==
In the US, midlist publications were negatively affected by the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case [[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue]], which changed how [[book publisher]]s have to account for and can depreciate unsold inventory each year. The Thor decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss. These books would previously have been kept in stock but written down to reflect the fact that not all of them were expected to sell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/how-thor-power-hammered-publishing/&lt;/ref&gt; This has been somewhat mitigated by the development of [[On-line book|online bookselling]], which makes less popular titles more accessible to average readers. (For more on this phenomenon, see [[The Long Tail]].)

The '''''Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence''''' (also known as '''''The Adoration''''')  is a painting traditionally believed to have been created in 1609 by the Italian Baroque master [[Caravaggio]]. Recent discoveries link the painting to that commissioned by Fabio Nuti in April 1600, and thus sent from Rome to Palermo.

It was stolen on October 18, 1969 from the [[Oratorio di San Lorenzo]] in [[Palermo]], Sicily.

The painting, which hung above the altar, was large, measuring almost six square metres (actual size 268&amp;nbsp;cm x 197&amp;nbsp;cm). Probably because of its size, it was removed from its frame by two thieves&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt; before being taken out of the church. After it was stolen, the Oratory was pillaged of other art, along with choir stalls of carved and gilded wood and benches inlaid with [[precious wood]]s and mother of pearl. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The local [[Sicilian Mafia]] are generally considered to be the prime culprits in the theft although nobody actually knows who committed the crime. The whereabouts of the work remain unknown to this day. Rumours of its destruction during the theft, or subsequently in the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]], have circulated from time to time as has the notion that the masterpiece is now hidden abroad. In 1996, [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], an informant and former member of the Sicilian Mafia, claimed he had stolen the painting as a young man on the orders of a high-ranking mobster, but other sources say it was stolen by amateurs and then sold on to various Mafiosi; at one point it is said to have ended up in the hands of [[Rosario Riccobono]], who was killed in 1982, after which it passed on to [[Gerlando Alberti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/02/05/bacara105.xml Will we ever see it again?], The Daily Telegraph, February 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], a former Mafia figure turned police informer, claimed that he was told in 1999 that the painting was stolen for a private collector but had been destroyed by rats and pigs while hidden in a farm outbuilding and the remains burned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6950256.ece Lost Caravaggio painting 'was burnt by Mafia'] Times Online, December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/28/arts.italy Mafia informer asked to solve mystery of stolen Caravaggio], The Guardian, November 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nativity'' is one of the most famous unrecovered stolen works of art; its theft is on the [[FBI]]'s top ten list of art crimes.&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theft of Caravaggio’s Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco |url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/fbi-top-ten-art-crimes/nativity-with-san-lorenzo-and-san-francesco |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=25 October 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The value, if the work was ever sold, is estimated to be $20 million&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;; though resale value on the black market, especially for an infamous work of art, is nowhere near the actual value.  On the black market, stolen art fetches perhaps a tenth of its estimated value if it can even be sold at all.&lt;ref name="Beast"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dickey|first1=Christopher |last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=Hot Potatoes |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/05/20/hot-potatoes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116210003/https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/05/20/hot-potatoes.html |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=19 May 2010|archive-date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a reproduction of the painting was commissioned by [[Sky plc|Sky]] and produced by [[Factum Arte]]. The replica was then permanently installed in the chapel, in the place of the original, with an official ceremony in the presence of the President of the Republic, [[Sergio Mattarella]]. In the same year, Sky produced the international documentary "[[Mystery of the Lost Caravaggio]]" by [[Sky Arts Production Hub]], which tells the story of the Nativity and the life of the artist. Through interviews and archive material, the documentary tells the story of the theft of the work in 1969, the process of reproduction and the technologies used to recreate the Nativity. The documentary debuted on January 27, 2017 on [[Sky Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Caravaggio Masterpiece Stolen in Notorious Mafia Heist Replaced with Replica|journal=Artnet News|date=December 11, 2015|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/stolen-caravaggio-replaced-replica-391166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirchgaessner|first1=Stephanie|title='Restitution of a lost beauty': Caravaggio Nativity replica brought to Palermo|journal=The Guardian|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/10/restitution-lost-beauty-stolen-caravaggio-nativity-replica-brought-palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=The Telegraph|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12044479/How-a-long-lost-Caravaggio-masterpiece-was-recreated-nearly-50-years-after-it-was-stolen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vivarelli|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=Variety|date=December 18, 2015|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/global/murdoch-owned-sky-paybox-mixes-philanthropy-and-production-with-operation-caravaggio-1201662897/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalewski|first1=Daniel|last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=The Factory of Fakes|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 28, 2016|pages=75, 77|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-factory-of-fakes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rakuten.co.uk''' is a [[website]] owned by [[Rakuten]], that operates as an [[online marketplace]]. The website does not sell any products directly, but instead allows third party sellers to sell their products. The website replaced '''Play.com''', which was originally established in [[Jersey]] as an online retailer of entertainment products including DVDs and music, which subsequently expanded its product offering.

Rakuten purchased Play.com in 2011,&lt;ref name=playbuy&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Zoe|title=Play.com sold to Rakuten of Japan for £25m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/21/playcom-sold-rakuten-japan|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 the company switched to its new marketplace format following a change in the law covering tax for companies operating in Jersey and selling to consumers on the UK mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-20953357|title=Jersey retailer Play.com closes direct retail business|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Play.com website was replaced by Rakuten.co.uk on March 23, 2015.

==History==

===Play.com===
[[File:Rakuten Play.com Logo.png|thumb|Former Play.com logo following its purchase by Rakuten]]
Play.com was founded in 1998 under the name '''Play247.com''', but rebranded as Play.com in 2000. Play.com originally sold region 1 and 2 DVDs only, but since expanded its range to include CDs and [[video game]]s and other electronic items. In 2004 it began to sell books and [[electronics]], in 2006 it started selling [[personal computers]], [[posters]] and [[T-shirt]]s and in 2007 it started selling [[HD DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]]s, with sister site PlayUSA.com selling region 1 DVDs, HD DVDs and region A [[Blu-ray Disc]]s and offering sales in a range of currencies. The site's interface was redesigned on a number of occasions.

Play.com was ranked second on the November 2006 UK "Hot Shops List" compiled by IMRG and [[Hitwise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitwise.com/news/uk200611.html "November Hitwise - IMRG Hot Shops List"] - hitwise.com; retrieved 12 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Play.com started selling DRM-free MP3s, clothing, accessories, and [[Ticket (admission)|tickets for events]], allowing customers to buy and sell tickets. They also held a consumer games show which was open to the public, with tickets available through Play.com. This event was backed by [[Sony]], [[Microsoft]], [[Ubisoft]], [[Activision]], and [[THQ]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Ennis |url=http://www.ripten.com/2008/01/31/playcom-live-first-major-uk-gaming-event/ |title=Play.com Live: First Major UK Gaming Event |publisher=Ripten.com |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2009, a survey published by Verdict Research found Play.com was the UK's second favourite music and video retailer, behind first place Amazon.co.uk and ahead of the now defunct entertainment retailer [[Zavvi (retailer)|Zavvi]] which was third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/74820-amazon-is-uks-third-favourite-retailer.html |title=Amazon is UK's third favourite retailer |publisher=theBookseller.com |accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2009, it was reported that Play.com had topped the National Consumer Satisfaction Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ieda4f2f47125746da816749f5c0f4caa |title=U.K. Consumers Most Satisfied With Play.com |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsiuk.com/index.php |title=Ncsi-Uk |publisher=Ncsi-Uk |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of [[Amazon.co.uk]] and [[iTunes]].

In May 2009, Play.com launched a branded [[Visa Inc.|Visa credit card]] in partnership with [[MBNA]]. Cardholders received points for purchases made on the website and at other retailers. Points could then be redeemed against products bought on the Play.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/Campaign.html?campaign=6748&amp;cid=5106868 |title=Credit Card |publisher=Play.com |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/news.phtml/24223/playcom-offers-credit-card-loyalty-points.phtml |title=Play.com offers credit card |publisher=Pocket-lint.com |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayUSA.com website was closed down in February 2011. In September 2011, Japan-based Rakuten purchased Play.com for £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a341548/playcom-bought-by-japanese-firm-rakuten-for-gbp25m.html |title=Play.com bought by Japanese firm Rakuten for £25m - Media News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2013, Play.com has operated solely as an online marketplace, where third party retailers sell products with their listings hosted on the website. All retailers on the Marketplace have the ability to build a fully branded and customised storefront, giving them control of how their products are merchandised.

===Replacement with Rakuten===
In October 2014, Rakuten launched Rakuten.co.uk, which replaced Play.com completely on 23 March 2015.

'''Rakuten UK to close'''

On June 7, 2016, Rakuten announced plans for changes in the business in the UK. Rakuten.co.uk in its existing format would no longer be available after the end of August 2016 for new purchases. Rakuten.co.uk was then relaunched in October 2016 as a portal to earn "Superpoints" from using online shops such as Topman, HMV and B&amp;Q.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.newsletter.rakuten.co.uk/public/r/yufXLs4Iz0D4hYWhNKfcMQ/mze+19T2aUwm4NRq0+5ZPQ/dNDOVSFzHI1Rsk5dlIFT6A|title=An error has occurred|author=|date=|website=link.newsletter.rakuten.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Septic Tank''' are a British [[punk rock]] band formed out of [[Coventry]] [[doom metal]] band [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]]. The band was originally formed in 1994, while the then-Cathedral were on tour, and later reformed in 2013 after Cathedral's breakup. Once the band reunited, producer and former member of the UK band Trouble, Jaime "Gomez" Arellano, replaced drummer [[Barry Stern]], due to his death in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SEPTIC TANK Feat.

}}The  '''Producers Council''' ({{lang-en|Producers' association}}), officially known as the '''Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC)''', is a [[Trade union|union]] for [[film]] producers in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], based in [[Chennai]]. Formed in 18 July 1979, the group has a charitable trust fund to provide financial support to retired producers, voiced support for film producers and have collectively protested  for socio-political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tfpc.org/history|title=History – Tamil Film Producers Council|website=tfpc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in the Producers council, which is made up of over 1500 members, are held once every two years to determine the president of the group.

Government has formed a committee to decide on the existence of state's 30% entertainment tax. Its reported that, per day business loss during the strike was around ₹ 20 crores.

In July 2017, TFPC decided to break the exclusivity of them to work only with employees from [[Film Employees Federation of South India|FEFSI]], so they announced that they will be working with both FEFSI members and non-FEFSI members. Though TFPC has signed exclusivity with FEFSI, FEFSI has not signed any exclusivity with TFPC, hence FEFSI members can work with TFPC producers and also with other languages producers and ad film makers. TFPC's another agenda is, to regulate the excessive travel per-diem and the mandatory clauses to employ minimum a certain number of employees from FEFSI to film any particular scene of a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/tn-producer-council-vs-fefsi-what-is-happening-and-why-is-it-important-4778370/|title=Tamil Film Producer Council vs FEFSI: What is happening and why is it important?|date=2017-08-02|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/we-wont-give-in-vishal-on-fefsi-strike-actor-invokes-madras-high-court/articleshow/59865384.cms|title=We won't give in, Vishal on FEFSI strike; actor invokes Madras high court - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Brioche''''' is a late 19th century painting by French artist [[Édouard Manet]]. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts a [[brioche]] loaf resting on a table. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436946|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting was produced after a painting of a brioche by 18th century artist [[Jean Siméon Chardin]] was donated to the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]]; that donation spurred Manet to produce his own version in 1870. In Manet's work the brioche is accompanied by peaches and plums.

The work is on view in the Metropolitan Museum's Gallery 810.

It was accessioned in 1950 as one of the thousand items donated to the institution by [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]].&lt;ref name=phila&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51288.html |title=The Soothsayer's Recompense |date=1 January 2007 |work=[[The Philadelphia Museum of Art]] |access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was created in France, through a process of "squaring-up" in which De Chirico drew a version of the piece divided into nine squares, and subsequently used this draft to quickly create the fleshed-out painting.&lt;ref name=phila/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gale |first=Matthew |date=1 April 1988 |title=The Uncertainty of the Painter: De Chirico in 1913 |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=130 |issue=1021 |pages=268–276 |jstor=883282 |publisher=Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==
The piece depicts an empty city square, a recurring motif in works by De Chirico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Giorgio-de-Chirico#ref216264 |title=Giorgio de Chirico |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=30 June 2014 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=13 March 2016 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features a locomotive in the background, another recurring motif also found in ''[[Le Rêve Transformé]]'' and ''[[Gare Montparnasse (The Melancholy of Departure)]]''.

The statue at the center of the painting is meant to represent [[Ariadne]],&lt;ref name=dorment/&gt; who was the daughter of Minos, King of Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Homer |author-link=Homer |title=[[Odyssey]] |others=11.320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hesiod |author-link=Hesiod |title=[[Theogony]] |others=947}}&lt;/ref&gt; She assisted [[Theseus]] in his escape from the [[Labyrinth]], but he later abandoned her on the island of [[Naxos]]. Like the locomotive and empty square, Ariadne appears in other paintings by De Chirico.

'''Theatre and disability''' is a subject focusing on the [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] of disability within a theatrical experience. Disability may be included as the subject of a theatrical work, or represented in a character. There have been great debates concerning the portrayal of the sensitive subject matter, and whether or not enough research and compassion has been taken into consideration.

Disability in the theatre has been a prevalent and sensitive topic for centuries. More often than not, a theatrical production will choose to either exclude the use of disabled actors in a role of a character without any limitations. There are also cases where characters are written without any disabilities. Millions of patrons attend the theater each year, allowing them to gain insight and become educated on various social and political topics. Without the inclusion of disability in the arts, millions of people feel distanced or neglected from the remainder of society. There have been different forms of [[expressive therapy]], more specifically [[drama therapy]], as a form of therapy where people use dramatic tools to comfort and improve physical and mental health. Although found beneficial, it does not take the place of artistic achievement that people with disabilities strive for.

|"There was a time when people with unique disabilities could make a living because of their disability. But the idea of looking at people with disabilities became socially unacceptable." |Howard Sherman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theatre Artists With Disabilities Are Ready, Willing, and, Yes, Able|year=2015|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/20/theatre-artists-with-disabilities-are-ready-willing-and-yes-able/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

People with disabilities represent the largest minority group in America. They make up 20% of the population, yet are not perceived as such by people living without disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruno|first=Christine|title=American Theater: Where is the Tipping Point?|year=2014|url=http://howlround.com/disability-in-american-theater-where-is-the-tipping-point}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this the debate continues as to whether or not it is appropriate, and respectful, to personify people with disabilities in theatrical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romanska|first=Magda|title=Disability in Comic and Tragic Frames|year=2015|url=http://howlround.com/disability-in-comic-and-tragic-frames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of disabled characters in theatrical works==

===Tennessee Williams===

In ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', Tennessee Williams explains to the readers that the character Laura has grown up with a disability.  
"A childhood illness has left her crippled, one leg slightly shorter than the other, and held in a brace. This defect need not be more than suggested on the stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Tennessee|title=The Glass Menagerie|year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; This character description is vague enough to allow the director of this production to make their own decision as to how they want to portray Laura. There is enough ambiguity for the director to take the responsibility of showcasing disability as they see fit.

[[Blanche DuBois]], a character in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', is unable to find inner happiness and fails to see the true beauty that she embodies. Because of this, she relies on the male figure for temporary fulfillment. This could be due to the extreme loss she has experienced in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Tennessee|title=A Streetcar Named Desire|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Belluso===

The late John Belluso is an American playwright known for his work focusing on what its like living in society with a disability. Similar to many of his characters, Belluso was diagnosed with a rare bone disorder, causing him to live in a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schou|first=Solvej|title=Disabled Playwright John Belluso Dies|year=2006|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/disabled-playwright-john-belluso-dies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gretty Good Time'' is a play that centers around a woman suffering from post-polio paralysis. The audience rides the journey with Gretty as she is transported to a state institution where she will soon be unable to function on her own, therefore making her contemplate assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title=A Caregiver Not in a Giving Mood|year=2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/theater/reviews/13rules.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 play ''[[The Rules of Charity]]'' is a story about Monty, a man living with [[cerebral palsy]] who uses a wheelchair. His daughter Loretta acts as his caretaker, and much of the play focuses on her relationship with her father and what it is like trying to balance her life as well as her fathers.

|"Disabled people understand the world in a different way, you understand what it's like to be stared at... I feel... this impulse to write for the theater [is]... about shifting from people staring at me to, in a way, staring back at them." |John Belluso&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THEATER; of Disability and Dreams.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mike Lew===

Asian-American playwright Mike Lew recreates the famous tale of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III]]'', the most famous disabled and deformed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Katherine|title=Enabling Richard: The Rhetoric of Disability in Richard III|year=2016|url=http://www.mikelew.com/news/teenage-dick-vaguely-from-richard-iii-at-the-public}}&lt;/ref&gt; character written in history, in his play ''Teenage Dick''. The play centers around sixteen year old Richard, whose goal is to become senior class president. Richard suffers from cerebral palsy, and the audience learns the tribulations of trying to overcome heavy obstacles in a cut throat environment. ''Teenage Dick'' was performed at the [[Public Theatre]] in [[New York City]] in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Teenage Dick (vaguely from Richard III)" at the Public|year=2009|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/997/1181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations supporting disabled artists==

===Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts===

The Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts supports and promotes the inclusion of disabled people in all realms of performing and fine arts. Through various programming, Inclusion in the Arts aims to increase diversity throughout the United States.

"Our principal aim is to achieve full inclusion in American arts and entertainment, such that what we see on our screens and stages truly reflects the society in which we live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts is supported by several national associations including The Shubert Foundation, [[Actors' Equity Association]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild]].

===Broadway Accessibility Initiative===

In 2012, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Newsies (musical)|Newsies]]'' partnered with the Broadway Accessibility/Audience Expansion Initiative and Inclusion of the Arts to allow people with disabilities to receive the same theatrical experience as those without. The services now being provided are I-Caption for those who are deaf and hard of hearing, and D-Scriptive for blind audience members. ''The Lion King'' became the first autistic friendly performance in 2011.

===Deaf West Theatre===

[[Deaf West Theatre]] put on a production of ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' that premiered in Los Angeles, California and later transferred to Broadway in 2015.

{{quote
|"To me, the play speaks to those who are denied a voice, to those who don't fit into the norm, to those who are questioning and experiencing the pains of growing up."|Director Michael Arden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Signs of the Times: 'Spring Awakening' at Deaf West|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nearly half of the actors were deaf in this production. This new adaptation shed light on the power of disabled actors in the theater.

===Disability Art and Culture Project===

The aims of Disability Art and Culture Project is to support and advance artistic interest of those with apparent and non-apparent disabilities. In support of their mission statement, the DACP advocates for the artistic and creative interests of those who are disabled.

===National Theater of the Deaf===

Starting in 1967, the National Theater of the Deaf began producing shows with both [[Spoken Word]] and [[American Sign Language]]. This allowed the shows to bring in a larger audience, giving them the capability to challenge the way the audience members use their senses. This new type of theatre broke barriers as it incorporated a new form of language into the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King, Fahy|first=Kimball, Tom|title=Peering Behind the Curtain: Disability, Illness, and the Extraordinary Body in Contemporary Theatre|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An audience's perspective==

There have been several debates as to who should portray characters with disabilities. Should actors with similar disabilities play the character, or should unlimited actors portray the character after having done substantial research? Is it morally and ethically correct for a non-disabled actor to personify a physical impaired character? Directors have two options to consider when deciding which actor should play a disabled character. To expose the world what they are already experiencing, or to a show a world with deeper dynamics and diversity.

Within the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts, disabled actors are often asked to submit their headshot and resume, and it is ultimately up to the creative time on how the wish to portray disabled characters. Without an advocate for people with disabilities, oftentimes they go unnoticed when casting a production. According to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ([[GLAAD]]) in 2013, out of the 796 regular characters on broadcast primetime, only one percent was depicted as people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Where We Are on TV Report 2013|year=2013|url=http://www.glaad.org/whereweareontv13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In broad terms, '''transformation design''' is a human-centered, interdisciplinary process that seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in behavior and form – of individuals, systems and organizations – often for socially progressive ends.

It is a multi-stage, iterative process applied to big, complex issues – often social issues.

Its practitioners examine problems holistically rather than reductively to understand relationships as well as components to better frame the challenge.   They then prototype small-scale systems – composed of objects, services, interactions and experiences – that support people and organizations in achievement of a desired change.  Successful prototypes are then scaled.

Because transformation design is about applying design skills in non-traditional territories, it often results in non-traditional design outputs.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;   Projects have resulted in the creation of new roles, new organizations, new systems and new policies.  These designers are just as likely to shape a job description, as they are a new product.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

This emerging field draws from a variety of design disciplines - [[service design]], [[user-centered design]], [[participatory design]], [[concept design]], [[information design]], [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[systems design]], [[interactive design]], [[experience design]] - as well as non-design disciplines including [[cognitive psychology]] and [[perceptual psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[architecture]], [[Haptic communication|haptics]], [[information architecture]], [[ethnography]], [[storytelling]] and [[heuristics]].

==History==

Though academics have written about the economic value of and need for transformations over the years&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,8&lt;/sup&gt;, its practice first emerged in 2004 when [http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/  The Design Council], the UK’s national strategic body for design, formed [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012025011/http://www.designcouncil.info/RED/ RED]:  a self-proclaimed “do-tank” challenged to bring design thinking to the transformation of public services.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

This move was in response to Prime Minister Tony Blair’s desire to have public services “redesigned around the needs of the user, the patients, the passenger, the victim of crime.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The RED team, led by [[Hilary Cottam]], studied these big, complex problems to determine how design thinking and design techniques could help government rethink the systems and structures within public services and possibly redesign them from beginning to end.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006, the RED team, in collaboration with many other people and groups, developed techniques, processes and outputs that were able to “transform” social issues such as preventing illness, managing chronic illnesses, senior citizen care, rural transportation, energy conservation, re-offending prisoners and public education.

In 2015 Braunschweig University of Art / Germany has launched a new MA in [http://www.hbk-bs.de/studiengaenge/transformation-design/ Transformation Design]. In 2016 The Glasgow School of Art Launched another masters program "M.Des in Design Innovation and Transformation Design".

==Process==

Transformation design, like user-centered design, starts from the perspective of the end user.  Designers spend a great deal of time not only learning how users currently experience the system and how they want to experience the system, but also co-creating with them the designed solutions.

Because transformation design tackles complex issues involving many stakeholders and components, more expertise beyond the user and the designer is always required.  People such as, but not limited to, policy makers, sector analysts, psychologists, economists, private businesses, government departments and agencies, front-line workers and academics are invited to participate in the entire design process - from problem definition to solution development.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

With so many points-of-view brought into the process, transformation designers are not always ‘designers.’ Instead, they often play the role of moderator.   Though varying methods of participation and co-creation, these moderating designers create hands-on, collaborative workshops (a.k.a. [[charrette]]) that make the design process accessible to the non-designers.

Ideas from workshops are rapidly prototyped and beta-tested in the real world with a group of real end users.  Their experience with and opinions of the prototypes are recorded and fed back into the workshops and development of the next prototype.

'''''Ways of Seeing''''' is a 1972 television series of 30-minute films created chiefly by writer [[John Berger]] and producer [[Mike Dibb]]. It was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name. 

The series was intended as a response to [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' series, which represents a more traditionalist view of the Western artistic and cultural canon, and the series and book criticize traditional [[Western culture|Western cultural]] [[aesthetics]] by raising questions about hidden [[ideology|ideologies]] in visual images.

| Title           = Episode 1
| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|08|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = The first part of the television series drew on ideas from [[Walter Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' arguing that through reproduction an [[Old Master]]'s painting's modern context is severed from that which existed at the time of its making.

| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|15|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = The second film discusses the female [[Depictions of nudity|nude]]. Berger asserts that only twenty or thirty nudes in the European oil painting tradition depict a woman as herself rather than as a subject of male idealisation or desire.

| Title           = Episode 3
| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|22|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = The third programme is on the use of [[oil paint]] as a means of depicting or reflecting the [[Social status|status]] of the individuals who commissioned the work of art.
}}
{{Episode list
| EpisodeNumber   = 4
| Title           = Episode 4
| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|29|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = In the fourth programme, on publicity and advertising, Berger argues that colour [[photography]] has taken over the role of oil paint, though the context is reversed. An idealised potential for the viewer (via [[consumerism|consumption]]) is considered a substitution for the actual [[reality]] depicted in old master portraits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2593">[[Image:Wrinkles 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|One of the Wrinkles, "Wrinkles Gemma White"]]
'''Wrinkles''' is a line of [[plush toys]] manufactured by [[Canada|Canadian]] toy company [[Ganz (toy company)|Ganz]] in the 1980s. The toys are identified by their characteristic wrinkled faces and clothing. They were based on the [[Hound Group|hound breed]] of dog. The original design was created by Senitt Puppets, based in Carnarvon, Ontario. [[Catherine Senitt]] designed and sold handmade puppets for over twenty years throughout the United States and Canada.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:wrinkWALSH.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wrink Walsh, one of the most famous toys of the line]] --&gt;
[[Image:Trunkit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Trunkit, the Wrinkles elephant]]
The dogs were made in three sizes. Most common are the medium-sized toys, which are about 18&amp;nbsp;inches (46&amp;nbsp;cm) high, and are the most [[anthropomorphic]], as they were designed to sit upright. They are dressed in jogging suits, in overalls and a T-shirt, or in dresses, and have openings to allow them to double as [[hand puppet]]s. There are also smaller, nine-inch-high (23&amp;nbsp;cm) toys, who sit on four legs and wear bonnets and booties, and larger toys, which are over 2&amp;nbsp;feet (61&amp;nbsp;cm) tall. Other Wrinkles animals were also manufactured, including a [[moose]] named Moogums (or Moogy), and an [[elephant]] named Trunkit.

As proof of authenticity, all Wrinkles toys have a bone-shaped symbol embroidered into their ear. As well, they all came with a fabric bone. The plush Wrinkles spawned some additional [[merchandise]], including metal [[TV tray|dinner tray]]s, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] figures, poseable dolls and even a [[direct to video]] movie.

The Wrinkles TV advertisement which aired during the 1980s featured the Wrinkles talking and chatting to the camera and finished with the dog looking to the screen and exclaiming "Hi, I'm Wrinkles, I've got my name under my ear!", at which point it flicked its little plush head to one side, lifting its ear to reveal the bone-shaped symbol under the ear.

Wrinkles have been sold as part of Ganz's "Heritage Collection", though the line appears to have been discontinued. Wrinkles dogs are fairly common fare on [[eBay]] and other [[Online auction business model|auction sites]] selling toys. They can also still be purchased from the original designers at Senitt Puppets.
