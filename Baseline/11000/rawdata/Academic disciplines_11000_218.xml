[[File:Big Crunch.gif|thumb|An animation of the supposed behaviour of a Big Crunch]]
{{cosmology}}
The '''Big Crunch''' is one of the theoretical scenarios for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], in which the [[metric expansion of space]] eventually reverses and the universe recollapses, ultimately causing the cosmic [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] to reach zero or causing a reformation of the universe starting with another [[Big Bang]].

Recent experimental evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is not being slowed down by gravity but rather [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]]. However, since the nature of the [[dark energy]] that is postulated to drive the acceleration is unknown, a Big Crunch is still possible, although not observationally supported as of today.{{citation-needed|date=May 2018}}

== Overview ==

If the universe's expansion speed does not exceed the [[escape velocity]], then the mutual [[gravity|gravitational]] attraction of all its [[matter]] will eventually cause it to contract. If [[entropy]] continues to increase in the contracting phase (see [[Ergodic hypothesis]]), the contraction would appear very different from the time reversal of the expansion. While the early universe was highly uniform, a contracting universe would become increasingly clumped.&lt;ref name=HTUW&gt;{{cite AV media | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | year=2014 | publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually all matter would collapse into [[black hole]]s, which would then coalesce, producing a unified black hole or Big Crunch singularity.

The idea behind the theory is that the expansion of the universe is linked to the energy released in the [[Big Bang]], therefore the outward speed of the matter would decrease over time due to gravity (mutual attraction). This would act as ballast and would eventually lead to a halt of the expansion. As matter attracts and there is no matter beyond the maximum expansion point, eventually all matter would begin to travel inwards again, accelerating as time passes.

The exact details of the events that would take place before such final collapse depend on the length of both the expansion phase as well as the previous contraction phase; the longer both lasted, the more events [[Future of an expanding universe|expected to take place in an ever-expanding universe]] would happen; nonetheless it's expected that the contraction phase would not immediately be noticed by hypothetical observers because of the delay caused by the [[speed of light]], that the temperature of the [[cosmic microwave background]] would rise during contraction symmetrically compared to the previous expansion phase, and that the events that took place during the Big Bang would occur in opposite order.&lt;ref name="Davies1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Paul |title=The Last Three Minutes: Conjectures About The Ultimate Fate Of The Universe |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |date=January 9, 1997 |isbn=978-0-465-03851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a contracting Universe similar to ours in composition it's expected that [[supercluster]]s would merge among themselves followed by [[galaxy cluster]]s and later galaxies. By the time stars were so close together that collisions among them were frequent, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background would have increased so much that stars would be unable to expel their internal heat, slowly ''cooking'' until they exploded, leaving behind a hot and highly heterogeneous gas, whose atoms would break down into their constituent subatomic particles because of the increasing temperature, that would be absorbed by the already coalescing black holes before the Big Crunch itself.&lt;ref name="Davies1994" /&gt;

The [[Hubble Constant]] measures the current state of expansion in the universe, and the strength of the gravitational force depends on the density and pressure of matter in the universe, or in other words, the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the universe.  If the density of the universe is greater than the critical density, then the strength of the gravitational force will stop the universe from expanding and the universe will collapse back on itself&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt;—assuming that there is no repulsive force such as a [[cosmological constant]].  Conversely, if the density of the universe is less than the critical density, the universe will continue to expand and the gravitational pull will not be enough to stop the universe from expanding.  This scenario would result in the [[heat death of the universe]], where the universe reaches the maximum state of [[entropy]] that is [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. In the state of thermodynamic equilibrium energy in the universe is evenly distributed so [[heat transfer]] or any other [[energy transfer]] is impossible so no reactions can happen in such universe making it "dead".&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/WMAP_Universe.pdf Dr. Gary F. Hinshaw, ''WMAP Introduction to Cosmology''. NASA (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}} One theory proposes that the universe could collapse to the state where it began and then initiate another [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; so in this way the universe would last forever, but would pass through phases of expansion (Big Bang) and contraction (Big Crunch).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/the_universe/Crunch.html Jennifer Bergman, ''The Big Crunch'', Windows to the Universe (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another scenario results in a flat universe which occurs when the critical density is just right. In this state the universe would always be slowing down, and eventually come to a stop in an interminable amount of time. Although, it is now understood that the critical density has been measured and determined to be a flat universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fraser Cain|title=How Will The Universe End?|date=2013-10-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWnduAnxLQ4|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent experimental evidence (namely the observation of distant [[supernova]]e as [[standard candle]]s, and the well-resolved mapping of the [[cosmic microwave background]]) has led to conclusion that the expansion of the universe is not being slowed down by gravity but rather [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]]. However, since the nature of the [[dark energy]] that is postulated to drive the acceleration is unknown, it is still possible (though not observationally supported as of today) that it might eventually reverse its developmental path and cause a collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Y Wang, J M Kratochvil, A Linde, and M Shmakova, ''Current Observational Constraints on Cosmic Doomsday''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7503">The '''Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges''' is a [[biblical commentary]] set published in parts by [[Cambridge University Press]] from 1882 onwards. Anglican bishop [[John Perowne]] was the general editor. The first section published was written by theologian [[Thomas Kelly Cheyne]] and covered the [[Book of Micah]].

Perowne exercised limited editorial control over the writers of individual commentaries: his aim was "to leave each contributor to the unfettered exercise of his own judgment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cambridgebiblef00unkngoog Preface by the General Editor], accessed 12 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8419">'''Nanoceramic''' is a type of [[nanoparticle]] that is composed of [[Ceramic materials|ceramics]], which are generally classified as inorganic, heat-resistant, nonmetallic solids made of both metallic and nonmetallic compounds. The material offers unique properties. [[macroscopic scale|Macroscale]] ceramics are brittle and rigid and break upon impact. However, nanoceramics take on a larger variety of functions,&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdelrazek Khalil|first1=Khalil|title=Advanced Sintering of Nano-Ceramic Materials|journal=Ceramic Materials - Progress in Modern Ceramics|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[dielectric]], [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]], [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]], [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]], [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], [[magnetoresistance|magnetoresistive]], [[superconductivity|superconductive]] and [[electro-optic effect|electro-optical]].

Nanoceramics were discovered in the early 1980s. They were formed using a process called [[sol-gel]] which mixes nanoparticles within a solution and gel to form the nanoparticle. Later methods involved [[sintering]] (pressure and heat). The material is so small that it has basically no flaws. Larger scale materials have flaws that render them brittle.

In 2014 researchers announced a lasering process involving polymers and ceramic particles to form a nanotruss. This structure was able to recover its original form after repeated crushing.

== Properties ==
Nanoceramics have unique properties because of their size and molecular structure. These properties are often shown in terms of various electrical and magnetic physics phenomenons which include: 
*[[Dielectric]] - An electrical insulator that can be polarized (having electrons aligned so that there is a negative and positive side of the compound) by an electric field to shorten the distance of electron transfer in an electric current
*[[ferroelectricity|Ferroelectric]] - Dielectric materials that polarize in more than one direction (the negative and positive sides can be flipped via an electric field)
*[[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] - Materials that accumulate an electrical charge under mechanical stress
*[[pyroelectricity|Pyroelectric]] - Material that can produce a temporary voltage given a temperature change
*[[ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]] - Materials that can to sustain a magnetic field after magnetization
*[[magnetoresistance|Magnetoresistive]] - Materials that change electrical resistance under an external magnetic field
*[[superconductivity|Superconductive]] - Materials that exhibit zero electric resistance when cooled to a critical temperature
*[[electro-optic effect|Electro-optical]] - Materials that change optical properties under an electric field

=== Nanotruss ===
Nanoceramic is more than 85% air and is very light, strong, flexible and durable. The fractal nanotruss is a nanostructure architecture&lt;ref name="Caltech 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fesenmaier|first1=Kimm|title=Ceramics Don't Have To Be Brittle|url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/ceramics-dont-have-be-brittle|website=Caltech|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[alumina]], or [[aluminum oxide]]. Its maximum compression is about 1 micron from a thickness of 50 nanometers. After its compression, it can revert to its original shape without any structural damage.

== Synthesis ==

=== Sol-gel ===
One process for making nanoceramics varies is the [[sol-gel|sol-gel process]], also known as chemical solution deposition. This involves a chemical solution, or the sol, made of nanoparticles in liquid phase and a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]], usually a gel or polymer, made of molecules immersed in a [[solvent]]. The sol and gel are mixed to produce an oxide material which are generally a type of ceramic. The excess products (a liquid solvent) are evaporated. The particles desires are then heated in a process called densification to produce a solid product.&lt;ref name="Sol-gel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chen-Chi|last2=Ying|first2=Jackie Y.|title=Sol−Gel Synthesis and Hydrothermal Processing of Anatase and Rutile Titania Nanocrystals|journal=Chemistry of Materials |date=September 15, 1999|volume=11|issue=11|pages=3113–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method could also be applied to produce a nanocomposite by heating the gel on a thin film to form a nanoceramic layer on top of the film.

=== Two-photon lithography ===
This process uses a laser technique called two-photon lithography to etch out a [[polymer]] into a three-dimensional structure. The laser hardens the spots that it touches and leaves the rest unhardened. The unhardened material is then dissolved to produce a "shell". The shell is then coated with ceramic, metals, metallic glass, etc. In the finished state, the nanotruss&lt;ref name="Nanotruss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fesenmaier|first1=Kimm|title=Miniature Truss Work|url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/miniature-truss-work|website=Caltech|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ceramic can be flattened and revert to its original state.

=== Sintering ===
In another approach [[sintering]] was used to consolidate nanoceramic powders using high temperatures. This resulted in a rough material that damages the properties of ceramics and requires more time to obtain an end product. This technique also limits the possible final geometries. Microwave sintering was developed to overcome such problems. Radiation is produced from a [[magnetron]], which produces electromagnetic waves to vibrate and heat the powder. This method allows for heat to be instantly transferred across the entire volume of material instead of from the outside in.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

The nanopowder is placed in an insulation box composed of low insulation boards to allow the microwaves to pass through it.The box increases temperature to aid absorption. Inside the boxes are suspectors that absorb microwaves at room temperature to initialize the sintering process. The microwave heats the suspectors to about 600&amp;nbsp;°C, sufficient to trigger the nanoceramics to absorb the microwaves.

==History==
In the early 1980s, the first nanoparticles, specifically nanoceramics were formed, using [[sol-gel]]. This process was replaced by sintering in the early 2000s and then by microwave sintering. None of these techniques proved suitable for large scale production.

In 2002, researchers tried to reverse engineer the microstructure of [[seashells]] to strengthen ceramics.&lt;ref name=seashells&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claire Diop|first1=Julie|title=R&amp;D 2002:Nano Ceramics|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401725/rd-2002-nano-ceramics/|website=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=December 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that seashells' durability come from their "microarchitecture". Research began to focus on how ceramics could employ such an architecture.

In 2012 researchers replicated the sea sponge's structure using ceramics&lt;ref name="Caltech"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Fesenmaier|first1 = Kimm|title = Made-to-Order Materials|url = http://www.caltech.edu/content/made-order-materials|website = Caltech|accessdate = 5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nanoarchitecture]] called nanotruss.&lt;ref name="Nanotruss"/&gt; As of 2015 the largest result is a 1mm cube. The lattice structure compresses up to 85% of its original thickness and can recover to its original form. These lattices are stabilized into triangles with cross-members for structural integrity and flexibility.

== Applications ==
Medical technology used nanoceramics for bone repair. It has been suggested for areas including energy supply and storage, communication, transportation systems, construction and medical technology. Their electrical properties may allow energy to be transferred efficiencies approaching 100%. Nanotrusses may be eventually applicable for building materials, replacing concrete or steel.&lt;ref name="Biomedical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Nissan|first1 = Ben|title = Nanoceramics in Biomedical Applications|journal = MRS Bulletin|date = January 2014|volume = 29|issue = 1|pages = 28–32|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231959874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early life==
Longuet-Higgins was born on 11 April 1923 in [[Lenham]], [[Kent]], [[England]].  His father was Henry H. L. Longuet-Higgins and his mother was Albinia Cecil Bazeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hugh Christopher Longuet-Higgins. 1923-2004 |year=2006 |last1=Gregory |first1=R. |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |volume=52 |pages=149-166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at [[The Pilgrims' School]], [[Winchester]], and [[Winchester College]]. In 1941, he won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He read chemistry, but also took Part I of a degree in Music. He was a Balliol [[organ scholar]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} As an undergraduate he proposed the correct structure of the chemical compound [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which was then unknown because it turned out to be different from structures in contemporary chemical valence theory. This was published with his tutor, [[Ronnie Bell|R. P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Bell            | first2 = R. P. | authorlink = H.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, he did [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of Manchester]].{{fact|date=April 2017}} In 1952, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at [[King's College London]], and in 1954 was appointed [[John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Chemistry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://venn.csi.cam.ac.uk/ACAD/lists/aciff.html Venn Cambridge University database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614112122/http://venn.csi.cam.ac.uk/ACAD/lists/aciff.html |date=14 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. He became interested in the brain and the new field of [[artificial intelligence]]. As a consequence, in 1967, he made a major change in his career by moving to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to co-found the Department of [[Machine intelligence]] and perception, with [[Richard Gregory]] and [[Donald Michie]].

He later{{when|date=April 2017}} moved to the [[experimental psychology]] department at [[Sussex University]], [[Brighton]], [[England]].  In 1981 he introduced the [[essential matrix]] to the [[computer vision]] community in a paper which also included the [[eight-point algorithm]] for the estimation of this matrix.  He retired in 1988. At the time of his death, in 2004, he was Professor Emeritus at the University of Sussex. His work on developing computational models of music understanding was recognized in the nineties by the award of an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the [[University of Sheffield]].

:You're browsing, let us imagine, in a music shop, and come across a box of faded pianola rolls. One of them bears an illegible title, and you unroll the first foot or two, to see if you can recognize the work from the pattern of holes in the paper. Are there four beats in the bar, or only three? Does the piece begin on the tonic, or some other note? Eventually you decide that the only way of finding out is to buy the roll, take it home, and play it on the pianola. Within seconds your ears have told you what your eyes were quite unable to make out—that you are now the proud possessor of a piano arrangement of "[[Colonel Bogey]]". }}

===Honours and awards===
Christopher Longuet-Higgins was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1958,&lt;ref name=rsbm/&gt; a Foreign Associate of the US [[Academy of Sciences]] in 1968{{fact|date=April 2017}} a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (FRSE) in 1969,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts]] (FRSA) in 1970. He was a Fellow of the [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]]. He had honorary doctorates from the universities of Bristol, Essex, Sheffield, Sussex and York. Among his notable prizes were the Jasper Ridley prize in music from [[Balliol College, Oxford]], the Harrison memorial prize from the Chemical Society, and the Naylor prize from the [[London Mathematical Society]]. He was a governor of the [[BBC]] from 1979 to 1984.

In 2005 the [[Longuet-Higgins Prize]] for "Fundamental Contributions in Computer Vision that Have Withstood the Test of Time" was created in his honor.  The prize is awarded every year at the [https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/index.html IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference] for up to two distinguished papers published at that same conference ten years earlier.

==Personal life==
His younger brother is [[Michael S. Longuet-Higgins]].{{fact|date=April 2017}} Longuet-Higgins died on 27 March 2004, aged 80. Although he respected many of the features of the [[Church of England]], he was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"By that time Longuet-Higgins had become a convinced atheist, although he still respected many of the features of the Church of England."

==Co-benefits in policy-making==
Co-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;

==Co-benefits in research ==
Different research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the [[Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The [[Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German [[Bundestag]]. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries. These four target countries are [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], and [[Vietnam]]. The project team, thereby, cooperates with national authorities and knowledge partners to develop key insights that enable them to mobilise these co-benefits in their countries and accelerate domestic processes aimed at achieving their international climate protection commitments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cobenefits.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
To use its institutions together to create a unique network that fosters scientific inquiry and discovery with regards to Earth's Critical Zone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much like the interconnectedness of Earth's critical zone systems, CZO relies upon a range of disciplines, including [[Geoscience|geosciences]], [[hydrology]], [[microbiology]], [[ecology]], [[soil science]], and [[engineering]], to develop a theoretical spatial-temporal framework for critical zone evolution for both quantifiable and conceptualized data analyses.

== Education and Outreach ==
Through research and education opportunities associated with each CZO, cross-CZO scientific endeavors, and annual meetings, CZO uses a variety of interfaces to communicate Critical Zone science to students and teachers.

The '''Department of Computer Science''' is a department of the [[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]] at the [[Comenius University]] in [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]]. It is headed by Prof. RNDr. [[Branislav Rovan]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Phd]].

== Educational and scientific achievements ==

The first comprehensive computer science curriculum in [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]]) was introduced at the Faculty in 1973. The department, established in 1974, continues to be responsible for organizing the major part of the undergraduate and graduate computer science education to this date. The distinguishing feature of the curriculum has been a balanced coverage of the mathematical foundations, theoretical computer science, and practical computer science. The part of the curriculum covered by the department at present includes courses on computer architecture, system software, networks, databases, software design, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, cryptology, data security and others.

The department succeeded several times in project applications within the TEMPUS Programme of the [[European Union|EU]]. The projects CIPRO and „Neumann Network“ helped to build the departmental hardware infrastructure and to establish the expertise in Unix workstation technology, networking, and structured document processing. The CUSTU PARLAB parallel computing laboratory run jointly with the Department of Informatics of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|Slovak Technical University]] also resulted from one of these projects. Furthermore, the department participated in project LEARN-ED under the COPERNICUS Programme and built a multimedia laboratory.

The department has been involved in the organization of one of the top European conferences in theoretical computer science ? MFCS ? each time it took place in Slovakia. Further conferences recently organized or co-organized by the department include SOFSEM '98 and DISC '99. Besides, the department houses the secretariat of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, of the Slovak Society for Computer Science and of the Association for Security of Information Technologies (ASIT).

== Research topics ==

Research in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics has the longest tradition in the department. Most notably, the result of [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] on the closure of nondeterministic space under complement, independently obtained also by N. Immerman, brought the [[Gödel Prize]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[EATCS]] to both of them in 1995. More recently research in parallel and distributed computing, cryptology and information security, and in software development has been initiated. The department is involved in international cooperation on the development of the structured document editor within the Euromath Project. 
The department has many international contacts, succeeded in research project application (project ALTEC ? „Algorithms for Future Technologies“) with partners from EU, and also has two research grants from the Slovak Grant Agency.

== Technical equipment ==

A network consisting of 20 workstations ([[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] in two workstation labs), Parsytec (with 20 [[transputer]]s and OS Parix), and standard PCs connected to a network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">'''''Draxt ī Āsūrīg''''' (meaning "'''The [[Asorestan|Assyrian]] Tree'''" or "'''The Babylonian Tree'''") is a [[Parthian language|Parthian]]-language [[poem]] consisting of about 120 verses and written in [[Book Pahlavi]] script. The language shows influences from [[Middle Persian]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; It is one of the oldest existing texts in Parthian language.

The poem is framed as a dialogue between a [[goat]] and a [[palm tree]]. At the end, the goat is proclaimed to be victorious. The Iranians may have adopted this genre from the oral traditions of [[ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;[[Ahmad Tafazzoli]], [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/draxti-asurig "DRAXT Ī ĀSŪRĪG"], ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', December 15, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the goat and the palm tree to be the symbols of [[Zoroastrianism]] and the [[Babylonian religion]], or simply the [[pastoral]] life and [[agriculture|agricultural]] life, respectively.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

The poem is also considered [[wisdom literature]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

A similar but less significant story, "The story of the vine and the ewe" ({{lang|fa|رز و میش}} ''raz o mīš''), has been recorded in [[Persian literature]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">The '''evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis''' was first proposed by Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold in 1995 as a way to explain the success of invasive, [[non-indigenous species]] (in particular, plants). Observing that:
# there is usually a lag period between the time of introduction of an [[invasive species]] and the point at which it is considered invasive, and
# invasive plants seem to be more virulent in habitats into which they have been introduced (as compared to their native habitats), the scientists presumed a sort of [[naturalization]] through modification for non-indigenous plants.
Because of a lack of native [[predation]], the scientists reasoned, introduced plants are able to reallocate resources from defense mechanisms into growth and development. Introduced plants can thereby [[evolution|evolve]] to grow taller, produce more [[biomass]], and yield more [[:wikt:viable|viable]] offspring than their native counterparts, according to the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/Blossey_Notzold_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Blossey and Nötzold tested their hypothesis on ''[[Lythrum salicaria]]'' (purple loosetrife) by potting seeds from plants growing in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., and Lucelle, Switzerland. The seeds were allowed to [[germinate]] in a lab at Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, northern Germany, and observed for two years. True to the predictions of the EICA Hypothesis, the plants derived from Ithaca produced significantly more biomass that the plants derived from Lucelle. The ''Lythrum salicaria'' plants derived from Ithaca also grew taller and were significantly less resistant to the root-feeding [[weevil]] present over its native range.

==Significance==

Unlike the notable ideas (concerning the success of invasive non-indigenous organisms) that preceded it, such as the [[enemy release hypothesis]] (ERH) and [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Habituation Hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species. Pg. 114–116. Harvard University Press: eighteenth printing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the EICA hypothesis [[postulate]]s that an invasive species is ''not'' as fit (in its introduced habitat) at its moment of introduction as it is at the time that it is considered invasive. As suggested by the name of the hypothesis (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability), the hypothesis predicts that much of the invasive potential of an invasive species is derived from its ability to evolve to reallocate its resources.

This idea is troubling{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} in that it adds a new variable to "invasive potential", making it harder to predict whether or not a species will become invasive if it is introduced into a new area. In other words, the EICA hypothesis presents a new environmental safety concern. If its postulates hold, in the long run, [[introduced species]] may have to be more highly regulated than they are at present, because no set of [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] or pattern of introduction can predict the extent to which an organism can reallocate its resources in response to a release from stress.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Scientific support and revision==

Since its debut in 1995, Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold's paper, "Evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis" has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The paper has been cited in over 368 articles in [[scientific journals]], including [[review articles]], tests of the hypothesis using different [[model species]], and expansions and reformulations of the hypothesis. Among the model species on which the hypothesis has been evaluated most recently (in its original form) are ''[[Solidago gigantea]]'' (giant goldenrod),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/e5v2m075252j1202/ Altered patterns of growth, physiology and reproduction in invasive genotypes of Solidago gigantea (Asteraceae)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sapium sebiferum]]'' (Chinese Tallow),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l847377740371176/ Increased competitive ability and herbivory tolerance in the invasive plant Sapium sebiferum]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lepidium draba]]'' (whitetop).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a0402043431336n7/ No difference in competitive ability between invasive North American and native European Lepidium draba populations]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three model species, the success and behavior of ''Sapium sebifurum'' agreed most closely with the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, according to the researches conducting the study. In its study, the success and behavior of ''Solidago gigantea'' was only partially explained by the EICA hypothesis, according to its researchers. ''Lepidium draba'' did not seem to follow any of the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, as the researchers of the study understood them.

Through most of the studies done on the EICA Hypothesis (see examples above), it holds that the introduced populations of invasive plant species are less able to cope with the pressures of specialist [[herbivores]] than native populations of the same species are, suggesting that invasive species ''do'' respond to accelerated [[natural selection]] after being released from the [[selective pressure]] of specialist herbivores and ''do'' have the potential to reallocate resources away from specific forms of defense. However, not all of these introduced populations produce significantly more biomass than the native populations of the same species under laboratory conditions. A study conducted by Bossdorf et al. in 2004 on ''Alliaria petiolata'' (garlic mustard) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00583.x Blackwell Synergy – Ecol Letters, Volume 7 Issue 4 Page 346-353, April 2004 (Article Abstract)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; may lend some insight into this discrepancy. Bossdorf et al. potted seeds from native and introduced populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' and put them in direct competition with one another in a laboratory setting (i.e. the native and introduced populations were grown on in the same pot of soil, and subjected to the same treatments), and found that in direct competition, the native populations were able to out-compete the invasive populations. Bossdorf et al. proposed that this observation could result from the fact that there is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] cost to traits that increase so-called "competitive ability". Under this assumption, invasive populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' had evolved a higher fitness (similar to ''Lythrum Salicaria'') in their introduced ranges at the cost of certain defense mechanisms ''and'' at the cost of certain aspects of growth and development (dissimilar to ''Lythrum Salicaria''). It could be, therefore, that the EICA Hypothesis is too narrow in scope, and should be reworded to place an emphasis on an invasive species' ability to reallocate its resources in order to procure a fitness advantage that may or may not involve more vigorous growth and development.

The '''Enumclaw horse sex case''' was a 2005 incident involving Kenneth Pinyan &lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; (1960–2005), a [[Boeing]] engineer residing in Gig Harbor, Washington.  Pinyan distributed [[zoophile|zoophilic]] pornography of himself receiving anal sex from a stallion under the alias Mr. Hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/movies/01lim.html A Lyrical Approach to a Subject That Shocks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcrunch.com/7-people-who-took-animals-for-lovers/ Horse Riding Mr Hands, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was reported in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' and was one of that paper's most read stories of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/horse-sex-story-was-online-hit/|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Horse sex story was online hit|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was informally referred to as the "Enumclaw horse sex case".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Macdonald|first=Moira|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2003097374_horse03.html|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Infamous Enumclaw horse sex case to be made into movie|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinyan's death rapidly prompted the passing of a bill in Washington prohibiting both [[Zoophilia|sex with animals]] and the videotaping of such an act. Under current Washington law, bestiality is now a [[Class C felony]] punishable by up to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Fifty-Ninth Legislature|last=State of Washington|title=Animal cruelty in the first degree|work=RCW 16.52.205|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=March 8, 2006|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=16.52.205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On July 1, 1976, section 9.79.100 of the [[Revised Code of Washington]], which prohibited "Every person who shall carnally know in any manner any animal or bird", was repealed and legalized bestiality in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/RCWArchive/Documents/1974/Vol1a.pdf 9.79.100]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/washington.htm#fn132 The Sensibilities of Our Forefathers Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Pinyan had worked for Boeing for eight years.&lt;ref name="thestranger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=30811|accessdate=2006-04-30|author=Mudede, Charles|title=The Animal In You|publisher=The Stranger|date=February–March 2006|authorlink=Charles Mudede}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously married to a woman and had children with her. He had moved from Seattle to [[Oak Harbor, Washington]].&lt;ref name=Mudededoesntwanttotalk&gt;[[Charles Mudede|Mudede, Charles]].

''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''. July 22, 2015. Retrieved on April 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Pinyan was building a new house and a barn, in which he planned to place a horse, on the Key Peninsula Highway in [[Gig Harbor, Washington]]. He was about to begin making payments on his 30-year, $144,000 mortgage on it.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;

Pinyan previously lost the ability to experience certain sensations after suffering from a motorcycle accident, and became involved in increasingly extreme sexual acts such as insertion of extremely large dildos, fisting, and receptive anal sex with horses. In the early 2000s, he found online a group of men, nicknamed "zoos", who began meeting at a farm in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington for communal weekends and filmed, and later posted online, each other being sodomized by horses, along with sometimes having sex with each other afterwards. According to Charles Mudede, co-writer of the 2007 documentary film ''Zoo'', the men trained the horses to penetrate them by stripping, applying a horse breeding pheromone, and bending over.&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt; Pinyan had a cast created of the penis of his favorite horse, Strut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/a-stable-relationship-7406907.html A stable relationship?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X4K4oPPLouoC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Transformative Consumer Research for Personal and Collective Well-Being]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The incident==

The incident occurred at a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm,&lt;ref name="seattle1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/videotapes-show-bestiality-enumclaw-police-say/|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Videotapes show bestiality, Enumclaw police say|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=July 15, 2005 | first=Jennifer | last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington,&lt;ref name="AndersonBarn1"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rick Anderson|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-11-09/news/closing-the-barn-door/|title=Closing the Barn Door|publisher=Seattle Weekly|date=November 9, 2005}} "Tait, a truck driver who lives near the Southeast 444th Street&lt;!--"Southeast 444th Street, WA" leads to an unincorporated area--&gt; farm where the death occurred, "&lt;/ref&gt;  five miles northwest of the city of [[Enumclaw]].&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt; Pinyan, and a man named James Michael Tait (who lived in a trailer next to the farm), plus another unidentified man, often visited the farm for sexual purposes. After either Pinyan or the other man recorded Tait being penetrated by a stallion, Tait then filmed Pinyan submitting to the same act. During this incident, Pinyan sustained internal injuries including a perforated colon.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;

==Death==

Pinyan was anonymously dropped off at the Enumclaw Community Hospital.&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Keegan | first = Rebecca Winters | url = http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1583009,00.html |title=Have You Seen the Horse Sex Movie? | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = January 28, 2007 | accessdate = September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2005, a man asked hospital staff for medical assistance for his companion. Pinyan was found dead in the [[emergency department|emergency room]], aged 45. The man who brought Pinyan into the hospital had disappeared by the time hospital staff came to contact him.&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt; According to the Medical Examiner's Office, Pinyan "died of acute [[peritonitis]] due to perforation of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]",&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt; and the death was ruled accidental.&lt;ref name="seattle2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/enumclaw-area-animal-sex-case-investigated/|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Enumclaw-area animal-sex case investigated|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=July 15, 2005 | first=Jennifer | last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

After Pinyan died, the authorities used his [[driver's license]] to find acquaintances and relatives. Earlier news reports stated that the authorities had used [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance camera]] footage to track down Pinyan's companion. Using the contacts, the authorities found the farm where the incident occurred. The police tracked down the rural [[Enumclaw]]-area farm, which was known in [[zoophile]] Internet chat rooms as a destination for people who want to have sex with livestock, and seized hundreds of hours of videotapes of men engaging in bestiality. One of the videotapes featured Kenneth Pinyan shortly before he died on July 2.&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt;

Prosecutors later determined that the horse had not been injured by being forced to engage in sex in this manner.&lt;ref name="AndersonBarn1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foundas, Scott.

Yes, the original source said "fucking". Changing it to "having intercourse with" (or similar) makes it no longer an accurate quote.

==Media reporting==
Jennifer Sullivan, a ''[[Seattle Times]]'' staff reporter, said that originally the King County Sheriff's Department did not expect the newspaper to report on the event, because "it was too gruesome." After an ''[[Associated Press]]'' report stated that the farm where the event occurred  attracted "a significant number of people" who wanted to partake in bestiality, the ''Seattle Times'' decided that it needed to write articles about the case, since multiple people were involved.&lt;ref name="WhattodoMesser"&gt;{{cite news | last = Messer | first = Lesley | url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/when-a-man-dies-in-a-sex-act-with-a-horse-what-s-a-reporter-to-do/ | title = When a Man Dies in a Sex Act with a Horse – What's a Reporter to Do? | work = [[Editor &amp; Publisher]] | date = July 18, 2005 | accessdate = 2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges, guilty plea, and sentencing==
The photographer, 54-year-old James Michael Tait,&lt;ref name="AndersonBarn1"/&gt; was charged with criminal [[trespass]]ing in the first degree, because the owners of the farm, a third party, were not aware that the men entered the property to engage in bestiality. The third man was not charged since he was not visible in the videos seized by investigators.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; On November 29, 2005, Tait entered an [[Alford plea]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/man-in-infamous-enumclaw-horse-sex-case-faces-new-charges-in-tennessee/ Man in infamous Enumclaw horse-sex case faces new charges in Tennessee ]."

Judge Christie ordered Tait to never visit the farm again.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Mudede wrote that at the time of the incident the residents of Enumclaw were shocked and angered by the incident. In 2015, ten years after the incident, Mudede wrote that Enumclaw residents were unwilling to acknowledge the incident.&lt;ref name=Mudededoesntwanttotalk/&gt;

===2 Guys 1 Horse===

After Pinyan's death, a video circulated around the internet of Kenneth Pinyan engaging in receptive anal intercourse with a horse. The video was nicknamed "Mr. Hands" or "2 Guys 1 Horse". The video, intended originally to sexually gratify the viewer, has became one of the first [[Viral video|viral]] [[reaction video]]s. This video is featured in the 2007 film ''Zoo''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d_Z1qnWuIg0C&amp;pg=PA516#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Transformative Consumer Research for Personal and Collective Well-Being]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Dennis.

===James Michael Tait===

In 2005, James Michael Tait moved to [[Maury County, Tennessee]] where he lived on Kenny Thomason's farm, which had 13 horses, Shetland ponies, goats and dogs. On October 13, Christy D. Morris was arrested with three counts of animal cruelty. On October 15, 2009, an anonymous person e-mailed investigators a photo of a man who was having sex with a Shetland pony from Kenny Thomason's farm, leading to the arrest of Tait and Thomason that same day. Tait was charged with three counts of three counts of felony animal cruelty, while Thomason was charged with two counts of felony animal cruelty. According to Tait's arrest warrant, he had been engaging in sex acts with a stud horse over a span of several months. Both Tait and Thomason admitted to engaging in sex acts with a horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605121119/https://www.wkrn.com/2009/10/19/3-accused-of-having-sex-with-animals-in-maury-co | title=3 accused of having sex with animals in Maury Co |publisher=[[WKRN]] | date=19 October 2009 | accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/man-in-infamous-enumclaw-horse-sex-case-faces-new-charges-in-tennessee/|title=Man in infamous Enumclaw horse-sex case faces new charges in Tennessee |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2017-06-11}} "James Tait, 58, was arrested and charged Thursday with three counts of felony animal cruelty in Maury County, Tenn."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lite-news.com/us-man-filmed-friends-having-sex-with-horses/ US Farmer in horse-sex arrest]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 Tait pleaded guilty in a Tennessee court to engaging in sexual acts with animals, and he was placed on probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sullivan | first=Jennifer | url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/felon-accused-of-running-animal-sex-farm-in-whatcom-county/ | title=Felon accused of running animal-sex farm in Whatcom County | work=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=16 April 2010 | accessdate=2016-05-11}} "Tait, 58, pleaded guilty in January in Tennessee to engaging in sexual activity with animals and was released on probation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 16.52.205 of the Revised Code of Washington ===

After Pinyan died,&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; [[Pam Roach]], a member of the [[Washington State Senate]] and a Republican from [[Auburn, Washington|Auburn]], crafted a bill to ban [[Zoophilia|bestiality]] in Washington State.&lt;ref name="WhattodoMesser"/&gt; Senate Bill 6417, which made bestiality a Class C felony, passed on February 11, 2006 with 36 state senators voting for it (The vote record is "passed; yeas, 36; nays, 0; absent, 0; excused, 13", meaning that 13 of the 49 total senators refrained from going on record about the matter).  Mudede wrote "It was an almost comically easy law to pass."&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; Bestiality had no political support in Washington state, and no group in Washington state advocated for bestiality.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;  The law is [http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=16.52.205 RCW 16.52.205](3).

Because of the provision against videotaping, Mudede stated that the law "points an angry finger directly at James Tait."&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; In 2015 Mudede said that he was unaware of any bestiality arrests in Washington State since the Pinyan incident.&lt;ref&gt;Sokol, Zach.

'''Ethnogeology''' is the study of how [[geological]] features were understood by ancient peoples around the globe from a "place-based" perspective, in specific reference to [[traditional knowledge]] and to the stories and ideas about the Earth that were passed down through traditions and the wisdom of elders.  The focus in past research tended to be on the unique ideas and knowledge of [[minorities]] and distinct cultural groups, and how this relates to universal and cross cultural knowledge discovered by humanity as a whole.  Knowledge claims that are based more on universal discoveries and natural science can be found in the subjects of [[philosophy]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], and [[geology]]. The term "ethnogeology" first enters the geological literature through the work of John Murray of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in the mid-1990s by virtue of his studies of the Northern Cree First Nation geological worldviews in the Province of Manitoba in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1996, Of pipestone, thunderbird nests, and ilmenite: ethnogeology, myth, and the renaming of a world: Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 28, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1997, Ethnogeology and its implications for the aboriginal geoscience curriculum: Journal of Geoscience Education, v. 45, p. 117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, a cadre of geologists and geoscience educators - particularly Dr. Steven Semken of Navajo Community College in Shiprock, New Mexico and colleagues - were examining the interesting connections among Native American traditional knowledge, geoscience concepts, and the unique vision of planet Earth's history as articulated by indigenous ethnogeological wisdom (see references below).

One global example of geological knowledge over thousands of years is the making of rock tools and [[arrowhead]]s.  Worldwide, humans have shaped specific kinds of rock into various tools.  These artifacts are evidence that there was some basic knowledge of which rocks were hard enough and easy enough to chip into various useful forms.  Ancient humans discovered certain rock formations that provided them with materials to work with.  [[Flint]], [[obsidian]], [[chert]], [[copper]] and [[quartz]] were some examples of useful rocks or minerals for thousands of years.

In addition, humans have always used natural, high, and dry ridges for land transportation.  Natural water ways were used for boats, travel, exploration, and trade.  Various types of natural elements were used around the Earth for centuries.  Gold and silver are prized for jewelry and trade.  Good soil is needed for agriculture.  Mountains and rivers provided natural boundaries, defence, and borders for various political groups.

'''Feminism in Germany''' as a modern movement began during the [[Wilhelmine]] period (1888–1918) with individual women and [[women's rights]] groups pressuring a range of traditional institutions, from universities to government, to open their doors to women. This movement culminated in [[women's suffrage]] in 1919. Later waves of feminist activists pushed to expand women's rights.

==History==
{{Further|History of German women}}

===Medieval period to Early Modern era===
Feminism in Germany has its earliest roots in the lives of women who challenged conventional gender roles as early as the Medieval period. From the early Medieval period and continuing through to the 18th century, Germanic law assigned women to a subordinate and dependent position relative to men. [[Salic law|Salic (Frankish) law]], from which the laws of the German lands would be based, placed women at a disadvantage with regard to property and inheritance rights. Germanic widows required a male guardian to represent them in court. Unlike [[Anglo-Saxon law]] or the [[Visigothic Code]], Salic law barred women from royal succession. Social status was based on military and biological roles, a reality demonstrated in rituals associated with newborns, when female infants were given a lesser value than male infants. The use of physical force against wives was condoned until the 18th century in Bavarian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women of means asserted their influence during the Middle Ages, typically in royal court or convent settings. [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Gertrude the Great]], [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1478–1504)]], and [[Argula von Grumbach]] are among the women who pursued independent accomplishments in fields as diverse as medicine, music composition, religious writing, and government and military politics.

===Enlightenment and early 19th century===
Legal recognition of women's rights in Germany came more slowly than in some other countries, such as England, France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|pages=406–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States, or Canada. The equal rights of parents under German law did not arrive until the German Federal Republic in the 20th century; the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] introduced in 1900 had left the law unaltered in the matter, basing it precisely on the [[General state laws for the Prussian states]] of 1794. Property rights were also slow to change. During the late 19th century, married women still had no property rights, requiring a male guardian to administer property on their behalf (exceptions were made for cases involving imprisoned or absent husbands). Any woman who had inherited an artisan business had some freedom in practice to run the business, but she was not permitted to attend guild meetings, and had to send a male to represent her interests. Tradition dictated that "the state recognizes a burgher but not a burgess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] brought a consciousness of feminist thinking to England and France, most influentially in the works of [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. This was a development that lagged in German-speaking regions. Where upper class women were literate in England and France and sometimes became prolific writers of feminist works, a network of feminist writers and activists was slow to emerge in what would become modern Germany. Many reasons have been considered as having a bearing upon this dilemma, from fractured regions, to the lack of a capital city, to the slow spread of novels and other literary forms in German-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with literary talent were more likely to work in relative isolation, yet they left a legacy of letters and memoirs that gained a new popularity as the nostalgic Kulturgeschichte (culture history) trend in the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist ideas still began to spread, and some radical women became outspoken in promoting the cause of women's rights. [[Sophie Mereau]] launched the ''Almanach für Frauen'' (Women's Almanac) in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism as a movement began to gain ground toward the end of the 19th century, although it did not yet include a strong push to extend suffrage to German women. Some women who worked for women's rights were in fact opposed to extending the vote to women, a stance that became more widespread at the turn of the 20th century, when many Germans were concerned that granting women the vote would result in more votes for socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany: 1648 - 1914|year=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780416776201|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilhelmine Germany===
Germany's unification process after 1871 was heavily dominated by men and gave priority to the "Fatherland" theme and related male issues, such as military prowess.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Young, ''Triumph of the fatherland: German unification and the marginalization of women'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, women became much better organized themselves. Middle class women enrolled in the ''[[Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine]]'', the Union of German Feminist Organizations (BDF). Founded in 1894, it grew to include 137 separate women's rights groups from 1907 until 1933, when the Nazi regime disbanded the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guido|first=Diane J.|title=The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation: Anti-Feminism in Germany, 1912-1920|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107849|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BDF gave national direction to the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patricia M. |last=Mazón|title=Gender and the Modern Research University: The Admission of Women to German Higher Education, 1865-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SKPLZtwulQC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2003|publisher=Stanford U.P.|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal organizations for promoting women's rights grew in numbers during the Wilhelmine period. German feminists began to network with feminists from other countries, and participated in the growth of international organizations; [[Marie Stritt]] was active as a feminist leader not only in Germany but with the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rappaport|first=Helen|title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers: A-L-v. 2.

Stritt's goals included suffrage for women, access to higher education, an end to state-regulated prostitution, free access to contraception and abortion, and reforms to divorce laws. Stritt was active as a member and leader in many German feminist organizations during the late 19th century and early 20th century, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rappaport|first=Helen|title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers: A-L-v. 2.

* League for the Protection of Motherhood and Social Reform
* Reform
* Federation of German Women's Associations (FGWA)

The FGWA had been moderate in its positions until 1902, then launched a campaign to reform the civil code, but the campaign failed to bring about any changes. Stritt found herself on the radical edge of Germany's feminist movement, spearheading the German Association for Women's Suffrage from 1911 until it disbanded in 1919, having achieved the goal of women's suffrage in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rappaport|first=Helen|title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers: A-L-v. 2.

Socialist feminists were active in promoting the rights of working class women. Socialist, communist, and social democratic organizations had feminist members, who promoted women's rights with mixed success. During the rise of nationalism in this era, one [[Fascism|Fascist]] organization that was vocally anti-feminist was the [[German National Association of Commercial Employees]] (''Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfenverband'', or DHV), which promoted the interests of the merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guido|first=Diane J.|title=The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation: Anti-Feminism in Germany, 1912-1920|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107849|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little opportunity for feminists of the working class and feminists of the middle or upper classes to work together. The expansion of Germany's industrial economy during the 1890s and up to World War I had brought more women into the labour force. However, cooperation between the social classes was "unfeasible" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guido|first=Diane J.|title=The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation: Anti-Feminism in Germany, 1912-1920|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107849|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's emancipation was attained despite pressure from The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation, which numbered several hundred supporters and was active beginning in 1912, disbanding in 1920. The antifeminist sentiment among some Germans reflected a variety of arguments against women's emancipation: {{blockquote|The arguments against women's emancipation varied but often included sentiments regarding the inferiority of women and women's subjugation to men as determined by God or by nature. More frequently and sometimes additionally, they included charges that a change in women's position in society would be morally wrong, against tradition, and would trigger a decline of the importance of the family. Such arguments sometimes surfaced as protective and paternalistic justifications, e.g., the desire to "shield" women from the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guido|first=Diane J.|title=The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation: Anti-Feminism in Germany, 1912-1920|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107849|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Writer [[Hedwig Dohm]] gave some impetus to the feminist movement in Germany with her writings during the late 19th century, with her argument that women's roles were created by society rather than being a biological imperative. During this period, a wider range of feminist writings from other languages were being translated into German, deepening the feminist discourse further for German women.

====Access to education====
In ''Sex in Education, Or, A Fair Chance for Girls'' (1873), educator Edward H. Clarke researched educational standards in Germany. He found that by the 1870s, formal education for middle and upper class girls was the norm in Germany's cities, although it ended at the onset of [[menarche]], which typically happened when a girl was 15 or 16. After this, her education might continue at home with tutors or occasional lectures. Clarke concluded that "Evidently the notion that a boy's education and a girl's education should be the same, and that the same means the boy's, has not yet penetrated the German mind. This has not yet evolved the idea of the identical education of the sexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Edward H.|title=Sex in Education, Or, a Fair Chance for Girls|year=1873|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=173|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18504/18504-h/18504-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education for peasant girls was not formal, and they learned farming and housekeeping tasks from their parents. This prepared them for a life of harsh labour on the farm. On a visit to Germany, Clarke observed that: {{blockquote|"German peasant girls and women work in the field and shop with and like men. None who have seen their stout and brawny arms can doubt the force with which they wield the hoe and axe. I once saw, in the streets of Coblentz, a woman and a donkey yoked to the same cart, while a man, with a whip in his hand, drove the team. The bystanders did not seem to look upon the moving group as if it were an unusual spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Edward H.|title=Sex in Education, Or, a Fair Chance for Girls|year=1873|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=178|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18504/18504-h/18504-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Young middle class and upper class women began to pressure their families and the universities to allow them access to higher education. [[Anita Augspurg]], the first woman university graduate in Germany, graduated with a law degree from the [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland. Several other German women, unable to gain admittance to German universities, also went to the University of Zurich to continue their education. In 1909, German universities finally allowed women to gain admittance—but women graduates were unable to practice their profession, as they were "barred from private practice and public administrative posts for lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Linda L.|title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521650984|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first women's legal aid agency was established by [[Marie Stritt]] in 1894; by 1914, there were 97 such legal aid agencies, some employing women law graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Linda L.|title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521650984|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weimar Germany===
Following women's enfranchisement, women's rights made significant gains in Germany during the Weimar Republic period. The [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919 enacted equality in education for the sexes, equal opportunity in civil service appointments, and equal pay in the professions. These changes put Germany in the group of advanced countries in terms of women's legal rights (Czechoslovakia, Iceland, Lithuania and the Soviet Union also had no distinction between the sexes in the professions, while countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Norway held onto restrictions to the professions for women throughout the inter-war period).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=Jill|title=Women in Nazi Society|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415622714|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany's Reichstag had 32 women deputies in 1926 (6.7% of the Reichstag), giving women representation at the national level that surpassed countries such as Great Britain (2.1% of the House of Commons) and the United States (1.1% of the House of Representatives); this climbed to 35 women deputies in the Reichstag in 1933 on the eve of the Nazi dictatorship, when Great Britain still had only 15 women members in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=Jill|title=Women in Nazi Society|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415622714|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbrella group of feminist organizations, the ''[[Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine]]'' (BDF), remained the dominant force in German feminism during the inter-war period. It had around 300,000 members at the start of World War I, growing to over 900,000 members during the 1920s; it has been noted, however, that the middle-class membership was far from radical, and promoted maternal "clichés" and "bourgeois responsibilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bookbinder|first=Paul|title=Weimar Germany: The Republic of the Reasonable|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719042874|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminist groups were organized around religious faiths, and there were many Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish feminist groups.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Weimar Republic]] was an era of political fragmentation in Germany. Along with the economic chaos of the inter-war years, [[Weimar culture]] in general had a degree of social chaos, which was experienced in the city of Berlin in particular. War widows and their children struggled to earn a living in a city where hunger, unemployment, and crime were rampant. At the same time, a liberation of social mores meant that women had a social freedom they had not experienced until then. Socialists and communists in particular became open in demanding free access to contraception  and abortion, asserting, "Your body belongs to you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bookbinder|first=Paul|title=Weimar Germany: The Republic of the Reasonable|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719042874|pages=178–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi era===
{{see also|Women in Nazi Germany}}
Historians have paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the liberal [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Renate |last=Bridenthal |first2=Atina |last2=Grossmann | first3=Marion |last3=Kaplan | title=When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears the role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically, the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jill |last=Stephenson | title=Women in Nazi Germany |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Claudia |last=Koonz | title=Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family and Nazi Politics | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Hitler proclaimed, "[A woman's] world is her husband, her family, her children, her house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guenther|first=Irene|title=Nazi 'Chic'?: Fashioning Women in the Third Reich|year=2004|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781859737170|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's highest calling was to be motherhood. Laws that had protected women's rights were repealed and new laws were introduced to restrict women to the home and in their roles as wives and mothers. Women were barred from government and university positions. Women's rights groups, such as the moderate BDF, were disbanded, and replaced with new social groups that would reinforce Nazi values, under the leadership of the Nazi Party and the head of women's affairs in Nazi Germany, ''Reichsfrauenführerin'' [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guenther|first=Irene|title=Nazi 'Chic'?: Fashioning Women in the Third Reich|year=2004|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781859737170|pages=94–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944-45, more than 500,000 women volunteers were uniformed auxiliaries in the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces (Wehrmacht)]]. About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses, and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagemann | first1 = Karen | year = 2011 | title = Mobilizing Women for War: The History, Historiography, and Memory of German Women's War Service in the Two World Wars | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 1055–1094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Luftwaffe, they served in combat roles helping to operate the anti—aircraft systems that shot down Allied bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=D'Ann |last=Campbell | title=Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union | journal = Journal of Military History | date=April 1993 | volume =57 |pages =301–323 | url = http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.htm | doi=10.2307/2944060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Germany, East Germany===

[[File:Allice schwarzer I 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Schwarzer]], founder of [[EMMA (magazine)]] and Germany's most prominent feminist, 2010.]]
Political life in the Federal Republic of Germany during the post-War period was conservative in character: {{blockquote|Political elites were dominated firstly by the CDU, a party focusing on economic growth and drawing on the support of established business interests and diverse local elites, and also latterly by the SDP with its traditional base in the male-dominated workers' organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Jenny|title=Politics, Feminism, and the Reformation Of Gender|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415016988|pages=233–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Demographic changes resulting from World War II meant that women were a larger proportion of the electorate for several decades, but this did not result in significant representation in government; by 1987, women were still only 10% of the representatives in the Bundestag. Women had less education, and were less likely to be employed, either in the professions, or the service industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Jenny|title=Politics, Feminism, and the Reformation Of Gender|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415016988|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, after the Federal Republic of Germany began making strides in its recovery from the aftermath of World War II, feminist issues began rising to the surface of public consciousness. Feminist writers such as [[Betty Friedan]] were translated into German, and a new generation of German feminists began agitating for social change. A disillusionment with conventional political parties, and even with standard Marxist activism, led to the growth of the radical Left during the 1970s, including militant groups. ''[[Rote Zora]]'' was one anti-patriarchy terrorist group; while it carried out an estimated 45 bombings and arson attacks between 1974 and 1995, it accomplished little.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Torry|first=Harriet|title=Germany's Once-Violent Feminist Adopts Quiet Life|url=http://womensenews.org/story/the-world/070813/germanys-once-violent-feminist-adopts-quiet-life#.UY-NR-DR3zJ|publisher=WeNews|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A development in the Left that had a longer-lasting impact was the establishment of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] in 1980. Feminists pushed the Green Party to include abortion reform as an "unqualified party commitment", and as more feminists became part of the Party leadership, women's rights were brought to prominence by the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Jenny|title=Politics, Feminism, and the Reformation Of Gender|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415016988|pages=235–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Germany's most well-known feminist, the "mediagenic" [[Alice Schwarzer]], founded the popular feminist magazine [[EMMA (magazine)|EMMA]] in 1977, and remains its Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abramsohn|first=Jennifer|title=Happy Birthday, Emma: German Feminist Magazine Turns 30|url=http://www.dw.de/happy-birthday-emma-german-feminist-magazine-turns-30/a-2326075|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State socialism in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) ostensibly meant equality between the sexes. Marxist writers such as [[Frederick Engels]], [[August Bebel]], and [[Clara Zetkin]] had written of the role of gender exploitation in capitalism. In the GDR, there was little public consciousness of conflict between the sexes, although women's rights were discussed by certain activist groups, drawing [[Stasi]] attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martens|first=Lorna|title=The Promised Land?: Feminist Writing in the German Democratic Republic|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791491225|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official GDR line during the 1960s and 1970s was that the Western feminist movement was "man-hating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martens|first=Lorna|title=The Promised Land?: Feminist Writing in the German Democratic Republic|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791491225|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the GDR were reputed to have a more exhausting way of life than women in the FRG, for a number of reasons. In addition to a longer formal workweek for GDR workers, women performed three-quarters of the housework and childcare{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Few people owned cars, and product shortages and long lines made errands such as grocery shopping more time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martens|first=Lorna|title=The Promised Land?: Feminist Writing in the German Democratic Republic|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791491225|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although men were entitled to one year of parental leave following the birth of a child, this was not actually taken. By the 1970s, some GDR writers were observing that women's social roles were lagging their legal and economic status. Women began to receive extension to paid maternity leave that were generous by Western standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martens|first=Lorna|title=The Promised Land?: Feminist Writing in the German Democratic Republic|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791491225|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism in Germany since Unification==
By the early 21st century, issues of [[intersectionality]] between diverse social groups gained the attention of a larger number of feminists and other social reformers in Germany and beyond. After decades of pushing for greater legal recognition as full citizens, [[Gastarbeiter]] (guest workers) and their children (often born and raised in Germany) won some reforms at the national level in the late 1990s. During this time, women's rights groups had not, in general, made the guest worker issue a feminist cause. There were sporadic instances of women's rights groups voicing support for women guest workers' right to vote, and to have other women's rights included in the government's 1998 draft law for guest workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State Feminism and Political Representation|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139446761|page=124|editor=Joni Lovenduski, Claudie Baudino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Networked feminism]], where women's rights activists communicate and organize using [[social media]], is a growing trend among younger feminists in Germany. The Ukrainian feminist organization [[FEMEN]], established in 2008, has spread to Germany as of 2013. Chapters have been founded in Berlin and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reinbold|first=Fabian|title='Sextremist' Training: Climbing into the Ring with Femen|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/topless-feminist-protest-group-femen-expands-in-germany-a-896068.html|publisher=Spiegel|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012 and early 2013, Twitter became the medium of mass protests against common types of sexist harassment. Using the [[hashtag]]s #''aufschrei'' (outcry), more than 100,000 tweets (messages) were sent to protest personal experiences of harassment, raising awareness of the issue and generating national and international press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zandt|first=Deanna|title=Germany's Problem with Women|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2013/02/01/germanys-problem-with-women/|publisher=Forbes Magazine|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's representation in government and the workforce has made progress in the early 21st century. The German Chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], has established her key role in European politics. Merkel's time in office has not been without controversy related to women's rights legislation; in 2013, she opposed an EU proposal to introduce 40-percent [[female quota]] on executive boards in all publicly listed companies with more than 250 employees by 2020, on the basis that this was a violation of member states' affairs. Germany's Labour Minister, [[Ursula von der Leyen]], a supporter of the quota in Germany, received a written order from Merkel to "alter her ministry's lack of an objection to the EU directive, so that the cabinet could present a unified face to Germany's EU officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany to block EU quota for women execs|url=http://www.thelocal.de/money/20130306-48369.html#.UY_i4-DR3zI|publisher=The Local: Germany's News in English|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 2015 the SPD party won the battle on female quota.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fictitious domain method''' is a method to find the solution of a [[partial differential equation]]s on a complicated [[Domain of a function|domain]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, by substituting  a given  problem
posed on a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with a new problem posed on a simple domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

==General formulation==
Assume in some area &lt;math&gt;D \subset \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; we want to find solution &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
 Lu = - \phi(x), x = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \in D
&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
 lu = g(x), x \in \partial D
&lt;/math&gt;

The basic idea of fictitious domains method is to substitute  a given  problem
posed on a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with a new problem posed on a simple [[shaped domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;). For example, we can choose ''n''-dimensional parallelepiped as &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Problem in the [[extended domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; for the new solution &lt;math&gt;u_{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 L_\epsilon u_\epsilon = - \phi^\epsilon(x), x = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \in \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 l_\epsilon u_\epsilon = g^\epsilon(x), x \in \partial \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

It is necessary to pose the problem in the extended area so that the following condition is fulfilled:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u_\epsilon (x) \xrightarrow[\epsilon \rightarrow 0]{ } u(x), x \in D
&lt;/math&gt;

== Simple example, 1-dimensional problem ==

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = -2, \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \quad (1) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Prolongation by leading coefficients ===

&lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; solution of problem:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dx}k^\epsilon(x)\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx} = - \phi^{\epsilon}(x), 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 \quad (2)
&lt;/math&gt;
Discontinuous [[coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;k^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and right part of equation previous equation we obtain from expressions:

: &lt;math&gt;
k^\epsilon (x)=\begin{cases} 1, &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\phi^\epsilon (x)=\begin{cases} 2, &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ 2c_0, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2 
 \end{cases}\quad (3)
&lt;/math&gt;

Boundary conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u_\epsilon(0) = 0, u_\epsilon(2) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Connection conditions in the point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [u_\epsilon] = 0,\  \left[k^\epsilon(x)\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx}\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[ \cdot ]&lt;/math&gt; means:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [p(x)] = p(x + 0) - p(x - 0)
&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (1) has [[analytical solution]] therefore we can easily obtain error:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u(x) - u_\epsilon(x) = O(\epsilon^2), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

===Prolongation by lower-order coefficients===
&lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; solution of problem:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d^2u_\epsilon}{dx^2} - c^\epsilon(x)u_\epsilon = - \phi^\epsilon(x), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 \quad (4)
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\phi^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; we take the same as in (3), and expression for &lt;math&gt;c^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
c^\epsilon(x)=\begin{cases} 
  0,                    &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ 
  \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2.
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Boundary conditions for equation (4) same as for (2).

Connection conditions in the point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [u_\epsilon(0)] = 0,\  \left[\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx}\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Error:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u(x) - u_\epsilon(x) = O(\epsilon), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Foramen cecum''', in [[dental anthropology]], is a minor expression of the [[protosylid]] of the tooth. It is thus indirectly related to the five non-metric [[dental crown]] traits.  According to dental, biological studies, racially mixed populations have been discovered with deformed Foramen cecums, resulting in unique tooth groove patterns. Some dentists and scientists have hypothesized that Foramen cecums could in fact be a trait frequency exhibiting [[sexual dimorphism]].

Fossas and pits located in the protosylid, a Foramen cecum, have seemingly become rarer and rare over time. Most populations suffer from furrows of the cusps; most, however, do not develop problems located in the protosylid.

'''Form classification''' is the classification of organisms based on their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], which does not necessarily reflect their biological relationships.  Form classification, generally restricted to [[palaeontology]], reflects uncertainty; the goal of science is to move "'''form taxa'''" to biological taxa whose affinity is known.&lt;ref name=Bengtson1985/&gt;

Form taxonomy is restricted to fossils that preserve too few characters for a conclusive taxonomic definition or assessment of their biological affinity, but whose study is made easier if a binomial name is available by which to identify them.&lt;ref name="Faegri1963"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Faegri | first1 = K.| title = Organ and Form Genera: Significance and Nomenclatural Treatment | doi = 10.2307/1216676 | jstor = 1216676 | journal = Taxon | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–28 | month = | date =January 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "form classification" is preferred to "form taxonomy"; taxonomy suggests that the classification implies a biological affinity, whereas form classification is about giving a name to a group of morphologically-similar organisms that may not be related.&lt;ref name="Bengtson1985"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bengtson | first1 = S. | title = Taxonomy of Disarticulated Fossils | doi =  | jstor = 1304949 | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 1350–1358 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "parataxon" (not to be confused with [[parataxonomy]]), or "sciotaxon" (Gr. "shadow taxon"), is a classification based on incomplete data: for instance, the larval stage of an organism that cannot be matched up with an adult.  It reflects a paucity of data that makes biological classification impossible.&lt;ref name=Bengtson1985/&gt;  A sciotaxon is defined as a taxon thought to be equivalent to a true taxon (orthotaxon), but whose identity cannot be established because the two candidate taxa are preserved in different ways and thus cannot be compared directly.&lt;ref name=Bengtson1985/&gt;

== Examples ==
=== In zoology ===
Form taxa are groupings that are based on common overall forms. Early attempts at classification of [[labyrinthodont]]s was based on skull shape (the heavily armoured skulls often being the only preserved part). The amount of convergent evolution in the many groups lead to a number of [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxa.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, D. M. S. (1920): The Structure, Evolution and Origin of the Amphibia. The "Orders' Rachitomi and Stereospondyli. ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]]'', (series B), Vol. 209, pp. 1–73 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/92046 Article from JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups are united by a common mode of life, often one that is [[generalist and specialist species|generalist]], in consequence acquiring generally similar body shapes by [[convergent evolution]]. [[Ediacaran biota]] — whether they are the precursors of the [[Cambrian explosion]] of the fossil record, or are unrelated to any modern phylum — can currently only be grouped in "form taxa". Other examples include the [[seabirds]] and the "[[Graculavidae]]". The latter were initially described as the earliest [[family (biology)|family]] of [[Neornithes]] but are nowadays recognized to unite a number of unrelated early neornithine lineages, several of which probably later gave rise to the "seabird" form taxon of today.

Fossil eggs are classified according to the parataxonomic system called [[Veterovata]]. There are three broad categories in the scheme, on the pattern of organismal phylogenetic classification, called oofamilies, oogenera and oospecies (collectively known as ootaxa). The names of oogenera and oofamilies conventionally contain the root "oolithus" meaning "stone egg", but this rule is not always followed. They are divided up into several basic types: Testudoid, Geckoid, Crocodiloid, Dinosauroid-spherulitic, Dinosauroid-prismatic, and Ornithoid.&lt;ref name="Mikhailov"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Konstantin E.

"Form taxon" can more casually be used to describe a [[wastebasket taxon]]: either a taxon that is not a natural ([[monophyletic]]) group but united by shared [[plesiomorph]]ies, or a presumably artificial group of organisms whose true relationships are not known, being obscured by [[ecomorphological]] similarity.{{vn|date=January 2011}}  Well-known form taxa of this kind include "[[duck]]s", "[[fish]]", "[[reptile]]s" and "[[worm]]s".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Fossil wood''' is [[wood]] that is preserved in the [[fossil record]].  Over time the wood will usually be the part of a plant that is best preserved (and most easily found).  Fossil wood may or may not be [[petrified wood|petrified]]. The study of fossil wood is sometimes called palaeoxylology, with a "palaeoxylologist" somebody who studies fossil wood.

The fossil wood may be the only part of the plant that has been preserved, with the rest of the plant completely unknown:&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |title=Petrified Wood from Western Washington |author=Ed Strauss |year=2001 |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211224655/http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |archivedate=December 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore such wood may get a special kind of [[botanical name]]. This will usually include "xylon" and a term indicating its presumed affinity, such as ''[[Araucarioxylon arizonicum|Araucarioxylon]]'' (wood of ''[[Araucaria]]'' or some related genus), ''[[Palmoxylon]]'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Arecaceae|palm]]), or ''Castanoxylon'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Castanopsis|chinkapin]]).&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite book

==Types==

===Petrified wood===
{{Main|Petrified wood}}
Petrified wood are fossils of wood that have turned to stone through the process of [[permineralization]]. All organic materials are replaced with minerals while maintaining the original structure of the wood.

The most notable example is the [[Petrified Forest National Park|petrified forest]] in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mummified wood===
Mummified wood are fossils of wood that have not permineralized.&lt;ref name="strauss2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=414 |title=Mummified Forest Shows Effect of Changing Climate |author=Kelly Greig |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |publisher=Canadian Geographic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205052304/http://canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=414 |archivedate=February 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are formed when trees are buried rapidly in dry cold or hot environments. They are valued in paleobotany because they retain original cells and tissues capable of being examined with the same techniques used with extant plants in [[dendrology]].&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book

The 2015 total budget of Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute was around EUR 49,2 million. The external funding ratio was 75 percent. 49,8 percent of the budget came from industrial revenues, 13 percent from federal and state contract research, and 6,5 percent from funds provided by the European Union. Around 270 employees and 140 students worked at the institute in 2015.

==History==
=== Establishment of the institute ===
The founding phase of the [[Heinrich Hertz|Heinrich Hertz Institute]] began on August 1, 1927 with the written intention of the Study Society for Oscillation Research to establish an institute for the research on electrical and acoustic oscillation at the Technical University of Berlin. Members of this society were the [[Reichspost|German Reichspost]], the Prussian Ministry of Science, Art and National Education, the [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]], the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Hochschule zu Berlin]], the large corporations of the electrical industry, and the [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|German Electrical Engineering Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freunde.hhi.de/html/historisches.html History of the Heinrich-Hertz Institute] – www.freunde.hhi.de, as of January 31,2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively, the institute was founded on February 23, 1928 as Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research. The opening took place in 1930 in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Franklinstrasse 1, with the 4 departments: High-Frequency Engineering, Telecommunications and Telegraph Technology, Acoustics and Mechanics. Research focused on radio and television technology, room acoustics and electronic music among other things. 
The institute was reorganized in 1936 and the name Heinrich Hertz was wiped out from its designation in the course of [[Nazism|National Socialist]] [[Purge|"cleansing"]] in the interest of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].

=== Post World War II ===
After the institute building was entirely destroyed in 1945, the Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was newly founded in the same year by Gustav Leithäuser with the former department structure. During the time of the currency reform and [[Berlin Blockade]] in 1950, the institute was split into an eastern section ([[Berlin-Adlershof]]) and a western section ([[Berlin-Charlottenburg]], Jebensstrasse 1). In 1968 the institute moved into the new building at Einsteinufer 37 in Berlin.

=== Institute with state and federal participation ===
The institute was renamed to Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Nachrichtentechnik Berlin GmbH (Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Communication Technology) in 1975 with the state of [[Berlin]] and the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] as shareholders. Realignment of the entire HHI research profile by Horst Ohnsorge. Systematic work on current problems of modern communication technology. Vision of a universal broadband communication network on a fiber optics basis. 5 specialist departments: General Principles; System Structures; Image and Sound; Relaying and Transmission; Planning. Support for optical communication engineering as a key technology at HHI in the 1980s. Restructuring of the institute with formation of two divisions: Communication Systems with the departments of Relaying and Transmission, Signal Processing and Terminal Equipment, Economic and Social Sciences Accompanying Research, and Human Engineering, and the division: Integrated Optics.

In the 1990s research focused on the following fields: Photonic networks, electronic imaging technology for multimedia, mobile broadband systems, and integrated optics.

=== Transition to the Fraunhofer Society ===
The institute became part of the [[Fraunhofer Society]] in 2003 and received today’s name, Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI. The institute has been cooperating with the neighboring [[Technical University of Berlin]] for decades.

A data transmission system was successfully developed in 2006 with a never-before-seen speed of 2560 [[Gb/s]], which means transmitting a data volume corresponding to the content of 60 [[DVD]]s takes one second. What’s more, a breakthrough was achieved in video compression making it possible to store motion pictures in the high-resolution [[High-definition television|HDTV]] format with 2 million pixels per image on DVD.

On November 10, 2016 scientists of the Fraunhofer HHI established a bidirectional 1.7 [[Terabit|Tbit]]/s [[Free-space optical communication|free-space optical communications]] link over the air. The eye-safe optical beam transmission was transmitted over a distance of 380 meters. Eye-safe operation through 380-m air was successfully demonstrated at a total antenna output power of less than 10 [[Milliwatt|mW]]. The signals in both directions consisted of 40 wavelength channels of 43 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/press-media/news/2016/2x17-terabits-eye-safe-optical-link-demonstrated-over-380-meters-at-fraunhofer-hhi.html 2x1.7-Terabit/s eye-safe optical link demonstrated over 380 meters at Fraunhofer HHI] – hhi.fraunhofer.de, February 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GIOVE''' {{IPA-it|ˈdʒɔve|}}, or '''Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element''', is the name for two [[satellite]]s built for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) to test technology in orbit for the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM10V638FE_index_0.html First Galileo satellites named 'GIOVE'], ESA press release, 9 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giove is the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for "Jupiter". The name was chosen as a tribute to [[Galileo Galilei]], who discovered the first four [[natural satellite]]s of [[Jupiter]], and later discovered that they could be used as a universal [[clock]] to obtain the [[longitude]] of a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The GIOVE satellites are operated by the [[GIOVE Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMWL4N0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE mission core infrastructure], ESA press release, 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMUGJRMTWE_galileo_0.html One year of Galileo signals; new website opens], ESA press release, 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[GIOVE Mission|GIOVE-M]]) segment in the frame of the risk mitigation for the In Orbit Validation (IOV) of the [[Galileo positioning system]].

==Purpose==
These validation satellites were previously known as the ''Galileo System Testbed (GSTB) version 2 (GSTB-V2)''. In 2004 the ''Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1)'' project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization (OD&amp;amp;TS). This project, led by ESA and [[European Satellite Navigation Industries]], has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEM6KYP3K3E_index_0.html Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 experimentation is now complete], ESA News release, 7 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

GIOVE satellites transmitted multifrequency ranging signals equivalent to the signals of future [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]]: L1BC, L1A, E6BC, E6A, E5a, E5b. The main purpose of the GIOVE mission was to test and validate the reception and performance of novel code modulations designed for [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] including new signals based on the use of the BOC ([[Binary Offset Carrier]]) technique, in particular the high-performance E5AltBOC signal.

==Satellites==
[[Image:Giovea.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GIOVE-A launch]]
===GIOVE-A===
Previously known as ''GSTB-V2/A'', this satellite was constructed by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]] (SSTL).

Its mission has the main goal of claiming the frequencies allocated to [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] by the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]. It has two independently developed Galileo signal generation chains and also tests the design of two on-board [[rubidium]] [[atomic clock]]s and the orbital characteristics of the [[intermediate circular orbit]] for future satellites.

GIOVE-A is the first spacecraft whose design is based upon SSTL's new Geostationary Minisatellite Platform (GMP) satellite bus, intended for [[geostationary orbit]]. GIOVE-A is also SSTL's first satellite outside [[low Earth orbit]], operating in [[medium Earth orbit]]), and is SSTL's first satellite to use deployable Sun-tracking solar arrays. Previous SSTL satellites use body-mounted solar arrays, which generate less power per unit area as they do not face the Sun directly.

====Launched on 28 December 2005====
It was launched at 05:19 UTC on December 28, 2005 on a [[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Fregat]] from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]].

====First Galileo transmissions====
It began communicating as planned at 09:01 UTC while circling the Earth at a height of 23,222&amp;nbsp;km. The satellite successfully transmitted its first navigation signals at 17:25 GMT on 12 January 2006. These signals were received at [[Chilbolton Observatory]] in [[Hampshire]], UK and the ESA Station at [[Libin|Redu]] in [[Belgium]]. Teams from SSTL and ESA have measured the signal generated by GIOVE-A to ensure it meets the frequency-filing allocation and reservation requirements for the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), a process that was required to be complete by June 2006.

====Technical details====
The GIOVE-A signal in space is fully representative of the [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] signal from the point of view of frequencies and modulations, chip rates, and data rates. However, GIOVE-A can only transmit at two frequency bands at a time (i.e., L1+E5 or L1+E6).

GIOVE-A codes are different from [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] codes. The GIOVE-A navigation message is not representative from the structure and contents viewpoint (demonstration only purpose). The generation of [[pseudorange]] measurements and detailed analysis of the tracking noise and [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] performance of GIOVE-A ranging signals have been performed with the use of the GETR (Galileo Experimental Test Receiver) designed by [[Septentrio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.septentrio.com/sites/default/files/papers/SimskySleewaegenMertensWillemsHollreiserF3iongnss2007.pdf A.Simsky et al.

There has been some public controversy about the open source nature of some of the Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringbritain.com/space/archives/40-Unlocking-the-truth-behind-GIOVE-A-signals.html Unlocking the truth behind GIOVE-A signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029133845/http://www.engineeringbritain.com/space/archives/40-Unlocking-the-truth-behind-GIOVE-A-signals.html |date=2006-10-29 }}, SSTL press release, 18 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early part of 2006, researchers at Cornell monitored the GIOVE-A signal and extracted the PRN codes. The methods used and the codes which were found were published in the June 2006 issue of ''GPS World''. ESA has now made the codes public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM4EDN0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE-A navigation signal available to users], ESA press release, 2 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Retirement====
GIOVE A was retired (but not decommissioned) in June 2012, after being raised in altitude to make way for an operational satellite. It remains under command by SSTL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Galileo_pathfinder_GIOVE_A_retires_999.html Galileo pathfinder GIOVE-A retires], 9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===GIOVE-B===
{{wikinews|Soyuz rocket launches GIOVE-B satellite}}
GIOVE-B (previously called ''GSTB-V2/B''), has a similar mission, but has greatly improved signal generation hardware.

It was originally built by satellite consortium [[European Satellite Navigation Industries]], but following re-organization of the project in 2007, the satellite prime contractor responsibility was passed to [[Astrium]].

GIOVE-B also has MEO environment characterization objectives, as well as signal-in-space and receiver experimentation objectives. GIOVE-B carries three [[atomic clock]]s: two [[rubidium standard]]s and the first space-qualified passive [[hydrogen maser]].

====Launched on 27 April 2008====
[[Image:Giove B - Rollout (012).jpg|thumb|alt=GIOVE B on the launch pad]][[Image:Giove B - Rollout (069).jpg|thumb|alt=GIOVE B on the launch pad]][[Image:Giove B - Rollout (145).jpg|thumb|alt=GIOVE B on the launch pad]][[Image:Giove B - Launch Day (052).jpg|thumb|alt=GIOVE B on the launch pad]][[Image:Giove B - Launch Day (081).jpg|thumb|alt=GIOVE B on the launch pad]]
The launch was delayed due to various technical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.space.com/spacenews/satellitecomm/GioveB_090106.html Giove B Launch Slips to Early 2007], Peter de Selding, Space News, 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and took place on 27 April 2008 at 04:16 Baikonur time (22:16 UTC Saturday) aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Fregat]] rocket provided by [[Starsem]]. The Fregat stage was ignited three times to place the satellite into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/releases/presrel08_04_27.html |title=Starsem successfully launches second Europe navigation satellite |publisher=Arianespace |date=2008-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602023204/http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/releases/presrel08_04_27.html |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giove-B reached its projected orbit after 02:00 UTC and successfully deployed its solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jydCERiyJhe5puK-JKlQ-n6BqEtw  afp.google.com, Second test satellite for Galileo launched, reaches orbit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502021713/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jydCERiyJhe5puK-JKlQ-n6BqEtw |date=2008-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Galileo navigation transmissions ====
GIOVE-B started transmitting navigation signals on May 7, 2008. The reception of the signals by GETR receivers and other means has been confirmed at a few ESA facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/GIOVE-B_launch/SEMGVUZXUFF_0.html ESA - GIOVE-B launch - GIOVE-B transmitting its first signals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technical details====
According to ESA, this is "a truly historic step for satellite navigation since GIOVE-B is now, for the first time, transmitting the GPS-Galileo common signal using a specific optimised waveform, [[MBOC]] (multiplexed binary offset carrier), in accordance with the agreement drawn up in July 2007 by the EU and the US for their respective systems, Galileo and the future GPS III".

“''Now with GIOVE-B broadcasting its highly accurate signal in space we have a true representation of what Galileo will offer to provide the most advanced satellite positioning services, while ensuring compatibility and interoperability with GPS''”, said ESA Galileo Project Manager, Javier Benedicto.

After launch, early orbit operations and platform commissioning, GIOVE-B's navigation payload was switched on and signal transmission commenced on May 7 and the quality of these signals is now being checked. Several facilities are involved in this process, including the GIOVE-B Control Centre at Telespazio's facilities in Fucino, Italy, the Galileo Processing Centre at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, the ESA ground station at Redu, Belgium, and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) Chilbolton Observatory in the United Kingdom.
 
Chilbolton's 25-metre antenna makes it possible to analyse the characteristics of GIOVE-B signals with great accuracy and verify that they conform to the Galileo system's design specification. Each time the satellite is visible from Redu and Chilbolton, the large antennas are activated and track the satellite. GIOVE-B is orbiting at an altitude of 23 173 kilometres, making a complete journey around the Earth in 14 hours and 3 minutes.
 
The quality of the signals transmitted by GIOVE-B will have an important influence on the accuracy of the positioning information that will be provided by the user receivers on the ground. On board, GIOVE-B carries a passive hydrogen maser atomic clock, which is expected to deliver unprecedented stability performance.
 
The signal quality can be affected by the environment of the satellite in its orbit and by the propagation path of the signals travelling from space to ground. Additionally, the satellite signals must not create interference with services operating in adjacent frequency bands, and this is also being checked.
 
Galileo teams within ESA and industry have the means to observe and record the spectrum of the signals transmitted by GIOVE-B in real time. Several measurements are performed relating to transmitted signal power, centre frequency and bandwidth, as well as the format of the navigation signals generated on board. This allows the analysis of the satellite transmissions in the three frequency bands reserved for it.
 
The GIOVE-B mission also represents an opportunity for validating in-orbit critical satellite technologies, characterising the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) radiation environment, and to test a key element of the future Galileo system - the user receivers.

===GIOVE-A2===
With the delays of GIOVE-B, the European Space Agency again contracted with [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd|SSTL]] for a second satellite, to ensure that the Galileo programme continues without any interruptions that could lead to loss of frequency allocations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM8LNN0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE-A2 to secure the Galileo programme], European Space Agency press release, 5 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of GIOVE-A2 was terminated due to the successful launch and in-orbit operation of GIOVE-B.

==Mission segment==
'''The GIOVE Mission''' segment, or '''GIOVE-M''', is the name of a project dedicated to the exploitation and experimentation of the GIOVE satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMWL4N0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE mission core infrastructure], ESA press release, 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The GIOVE Mission was intended to ensure risk mitigation of the In Orbit Validation (IOV) phase of the [[Galileo positioning system]].

==GIOVE Mission history==
The GIOVE Mission Segment began in October 2005 with the purpose of providing experimental results based on real data to be used for risk mitigation throughout the overall [[Galileo In Orbit Validation]] (IOV) phase of the [[Galileo positioning system]]. 

The GIOVE Mission segment infrastructure was based on evolution of the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) infrastructure conceived to process data from the GIOVE-A and GIOVE-B satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giove.esa.int/page_index.php?menu=101&amp;page_id=34 GIOVE System Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324074824/http://www.giove.esa.int/page_index.php?menu=101&amp;page_id=34 |date=2007-03-24 }}, GIOVE website.&lt;/ref&gt; The GIOVE Mission segment was composed of a central processing facility called the Giove Processing Center (GPC) and a network of thirteen experimental Giove Sensor Stations (GESS).

The main objectives of the GIOVE Mission Segment experimentation were in the areas of:
* On-board clock characterisation
* Navigation message generation
* Orbit modelling

A '''heartbeat message''' in signal processing is a message sent from an originator to a destination that enables the destination to identify if and when the originator fails or is no longer available.&lt;ref name="att01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gVQ3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 4,710,926 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |author=Brown|date=1987-12-01|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a [[periodic_function|periodic]] or recurring basis from the originator's start-up until the originator's shutdown. When the destination identifies a lack of heartbeat messages during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that the originator has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available.  Heartbeat messages may be used for [[high-availability]] and [[fault tolerance]] purposes.

The '''Indiana Asteroid Program''' was a photographic [[astronomical survey]] of [[asteroid]]s during 1949–1967, at the U.S. [[Goethe Link Observatory]] near [[Brooklyn, Indiana|Brooklyn]], Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.indiana.edu/edmodson.shtml Indiana University Department of Astronomy: Frank Edmondson Home Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613032249/http://www.astro.indiana.edu/edmodson.shtml |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was initiated by [[Frank K. Edmondson]] of [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] using a 10-inch ''f/''6.5 [[Cooke triplet]] [[astrograph]]ic camera.&lt;ref name="Gehrels-1958" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.maa.clell.de/Cat/Vol1/Asteroid/dis1note.dat Asteroids II Machine-Readable Data Base - Version March 1988, Binzel, R.P. et al., eds. 1989, Univ. of Arizona Press, Note 103:]"Planets discovered by the Indiana Asteroid Program, Goethe Link Observatory, Indiana University. This program was conceived and directed by F. K. Edmondson; the plates were blinked and measured astrometrically by B. Potter and, following her retirement, by D. Owings, and the photometry was performed under the direction of T. Gehrels. During the years 1947-1967, in which the plates were exposed, a large number of people participated in various aspects of the program." &lt;/ref&gt;

Its objectives included recovering asteroids that were far from their predicted positions, making new orbital calculations or revising old ones, deriving [[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] accurate to about 0.1 mag, and training students.&lt;ref name="Gehrels-1958" /&gt;

When the observatory's 36-inch (0.91-meter) [[reflecting telescope]] proved unsuitable for searching for asteroids, postdoctoral fellow [[James Cuffey]] arranged the permanent loan of a 10-inch (25-centimeter) lens from the [[University of Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Kingery, ''Betting on a Sure Thing: A "Record" Ending to Indiana Asteroid Program,'' Indiana Alumni Magazine, v.1, no. 2, September/October 2008, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Alumni Association, p. 46; See also, [http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/IU_Asteroid_Program_Records_Final_Chapter_999.html Space Daily].&lt;/ref&gt; Mounted in a shed near the main observatory, the instrument using the borrowed lens was responsible for all of the program's discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1958, the program had produced 3,500 [[photographic plate]]s showing 12,000 asteroid images and had published about 2,000 accurate positions in the ''[[Minor Planet Circular]]''.&lt;ref name="Gehrels-1958" /&gt; When the program ended in 1967, it had discovered a total of 119 asteroids.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt; The program's highest numbered discovery, [[30718 Records]], made in 1955, was not named until November 2007 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 61269}}).&lt;ref name="IU-Records" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The program ended when the lights of the nearby city of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] became too bright to permit the long exposures required for the photographic plates.&lt;ref&gt;Kingery, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The program's nearly 7,000 photographic plates are now archived at [[Lowell Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;Kingery, p. 47, and [http://www.astro.indiana.edu/edmodson.shtml Indiana University Department of Astronomy: Frank Edmondson Home Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613032249/http://www.astro.indiana.edu/edmodson.shtml |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infinite Ability''' is a special interest group on disability within the [[medical humanities|Medical Humanities]] Group of the [[University College of Medical Sciences]] ([[University of Delhi]]).

'''''The Jerome Biblical Commentary''''' is a 1968 book of [[Biblical scholarship]] and commentary edited by [[Raymond Edward Brown]], [[Joseph A. Fitzmyer]], and [[Roland E. Murphy]]. It is arguably the most-used volume of [[Catholic]] [[scriptural commentary]] in the United States with the first edition selling 200,000 copies; it was also translated into Spanish, Italian and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Preface, ''New Jerome Biblical Commentary'', p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's title is a reference to [[Jerome]], known for his translation of the Bible into Latin (the [[Vulgate]]), and his extensive Biblical commentaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''law of contagion''' is a magical law that suggests that once two people or objects have been in contact a magical link persists between them unless or until a formal [[Ritual purification|cleansing]], [[consecration]], [[exorcism]], or other act of [[banishing]] breaks the non-material bond. The first description of the law of contagion appeared in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits and Bonewits]] have noted parallels in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonewits|first1=Phaedra|last2=Bonewits|first2=Isaac|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, and Substances to Heal, Change, and Grow|date=2007|publisher=New Page Books|location=[[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]]|isbn=1564149048|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a [[saint]], [[god]] or other venerated figure confers benefits to [[relic]]s, as do [[temple]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], by virtue of their having [[religious]] [[ritual]]s conducted within them. [[Psychics]] and [[mediumship|mediums]] commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their "focus" for [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] or [[clairvoyance]] or during [[séance]]s.

Dangers include, for example, a [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] might acquire a lock of hair, [[nail clipping]] or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a [[curse]]. [[Voodoo doll]]s resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.

==Unconscious belief in the law of contagion==
Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, [[psychological experiment]]s have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a [[serial murderer]].{{citation required|date=July 2017}}

In [[astronomy]], '''limiting magnitude''' is the faintest [[apparent magnitude]] of a [[celestial body]] that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.unh.edu/observatory/faqs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203124747/http://www.physics.unh.edu/observatory/faqs |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }} (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, limiting magnitude refers to the upper threshold of detection. In more formal uses, limiting magnitude is specified along with the strength of the signal (e.g., "10th magnitude at 20 [[Standard deviation|sigma]]"). Sometimes limiting magnitude is qualified by the purpose of the instrument (e.g., "10th magnitude for [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]") This statement recognizes that a photometric detector can detect light far fainter than it can reliably measure.

The [[International Dark-Sky Association]] has been vocal in championing the cause of reducing [[skyglow]] and [[light pollution]].

==Naked eye visibility==
The limiting magnitude for naked eye visibility refers to the faintest stars that can be seen with the unaided eye near the [[zenith]] on clear moonless nights. The quantity is most often used as an overall indicator of [[sky brightness]], in that light polluted and humid areas generally have brighter limiting magnitudes than remote desert or high altitude areas. The limiting magnitude will depend on the observer, and will increase with the eye's dark adaptation. On a relatively clear sky, the limiting visibility will be about 6th magnitude.&lt;ref name= "udel"&gt;http://www.physics.udel.edu/~jlp/classweb2/directory/powerpoint/telescopes.pdf (retrieved January 28 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There is even variation within metropolitan areas. For those who live in the immediate suburbs of [[New York City]], the limiting magnitude might be 4.0. This corresponds to roughly 250 visible stars, or one-tenth the number that can be perceived under perfectly dark skies.  From the New York City boroughs outside Manhattan ([[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], [[Staten Island]] and the [[Bronx]]), the limiting magnitude might be 3.0, suggesting that at best, only about 50 stars might be seen at any one time. From brightly lit Midtown [[Manhattan]], the limiting magnitude is possibly 2.0, meaning that from the heart of New York City only approximately 15 stars will be visible at any given time.

From relatively dark suburban areas, the limiting magnitude is frequently closer to 5 or somewhat fainter, but from very remote and clear sites, some amateur astronomers can see nearly as faint as 8th magnitude.  Many basic observing references quote a limiting magnitude of 6, as this is the approximate limit of star maps which date from before the invention of the telescope. Ability in this area, which requires the use of [[averted vision]], varies substantially from observer to observer, with both youth and experience being beneficial.

Limiting magnitude is traditionally estimated by searching for faint stars of known magnitude. In 2013 an app was developed based on Google's [[Sky Map]] that allows non-specialists to estimate the limiting magnitude in polluted areas using their phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hanlon|first=Larry|title=Turn Yourself into a Skyglow Meter|newspaper=Discovery News|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur astronomy==

In [[amateur astronomy]], limiting magnitude refers to the faintest objects that can be viewed with a telescope. A two-inch telescope, for example, will gather about 16 times more light than a typical eye, and will allow stars to be seen to about 10th magnitude; a ten-inch (25 cm) telescope will gather about 400 times as much light as the typical eye, and will see stars down to roughly 14th magnitude,&lt;ref name= "udel" /&gt; although these magnitudes are very dependent on the observer and the seeing conditions.

===Calculating limiting magnitude===
Limiting magnitude can be calculated by using a telescope.

As a first approximation, the gain in magnitudes of a telescope is &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot \log_{10}(\frac{D_1}{D_0})&lt;/math&gt;, where D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the diameter of the telescope's primary light gathering component, and D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the diameter of the eye's dark adapted pupil. Both quantities must be measured in the same units.  D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; varies from person to person but is typically 6–7&amp;nbsp;mm (~1/4").

A 10-inch (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 254mm) telescope therefore would provide a gain of about 8 magnitudes beyond what could be observed without it.  Thus, if one is at a site where the naked eye limiting magnitude (NELM) is 5, the telescope will allow one to see stars as faint as about magnitude 13.

In reality a telescope allows one to see much fainter stars because at higher powers the background is darkened and contrast increased. A typical 10-inch scope at high power (250× or more) will easily reach magnitude 15.{{fact|date=June 2016}} A formula including a correction for improved contrast is {{fact|date=June 2016}}
:&lt;math&gt; m_{improved with telescope} =m_{naked eye}-2+2.5 \cdot \log_{10}(D \cdot P \cdot t) &lt;/math&gt;
where&lt;br&gt;
D = objective or main mirror diameter in mm&lt;br&gt;
P = power or magnification&lt;br&gt;
t = transmission factor, usually 0.85–0.9.

==Large observatories==
Telescopes at large observatories are typically located at sites selected for dark skies.  They also increase the limiting magnitude by using long integration times on the detector, and by using image-processing techniques to increase the signal to noise ratio.  The [[Keck Telescope]], for example, 10 meters in diameter, can detect stars at 24 to 26th magnitude using a one-hour integration and [[adaptive optics]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/optics/lgsao/nirc2sens.html (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even higher limiting magnitudes can be achieved for telescopes above the Earth's atmosphere, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], where the sky brightness due to the atmosphere is not relevant.  For orbital telescopes, the background sky brightness is set by the [[zodiacal light]].  The Hubble telescope can detect objects as faint as 31st magnitude,&lt;ref name="maron"&gt;http://www.jaymaron.com/telescopes/telescopes.html (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/10th/vault/allabout.shtml (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (operating in the [[infrared]] spectrum) is expected to have a magnitude limit of 34th magnitude.&lt;ref name="maron" /&gt;

'''Manipulation check''' is a term in [[experimental research]] in the [[social science]]s which refers to certain kinds of secondary evaluations of an experiment.

== Overview ==
Manipulation checks are measured variables that show what the manipulated variables concurrently affect besides the dependent variable of interest.

In experiments, an experimenter manipulates some aspect of a process or task and [[Random assignment|randomly assigns]] subjects to different levels of the manipulation ("experimental conditions"). The experimenter then observes whether variation in the manipulated variables cause differences in the [[dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Manipulation checks are targeted at variables beside the dependent variable of interest.

Manipulations are not intended to verify that the manipulated factor caused variation in the dependent variable.  This is verified by random assignment, manipulation before measurement of the dependent variable, and [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] of effect of the manipulated variable on the dependent variable.  Thus, a failed manipulation check does not refute the hypothesis that the manipulation caused variation in the dependent variable.

In contrast, a successful manipulation check can help an experimenter rule out reasons that a manipulation may have failed to influence a dependent variable.  When a manipulation creates significant differences between experimental conditions in both (1) the dependent variable and (2) the measured manipulation check variable, the interpretation is that (1) the manipulation "causes" variation in the dependent variable (the "effect") and (2) the manipulation also explains variation in some other, more theoretically obvious measured variable that it is expected to concurrently influence, which assists in ''interpreting'' the "cause" (i.e., it only help interpret the "cause"; it is not necessary to ''affirm'' that the "cause" ''causes'' an effect).{{Clarify|date=August 2016}}

'''Material flow''' is the description of the transportation of raw materials, pre-fabricates, parts, components, integrated objects and final products as a flow of entities. The term applies mainly to advanced modeling of [[supply chain management]].

As industrial material flow can easily become very complex, several different specialized simulation tools have been developed for complex systems. Typical tools are:
* [[AnyLogic]]
* AutoMod for logistics systems
* [[Plant Simulation]] for production system

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Message design logic''' is a [[communication theory]] that makes the claim that individuals possess implicit theories of communication within themselves, called message design logics.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards, A. P., Rose, L. M., Edwards, C., &amp; Singer, L. M. (2008). An Investigation of the Relationships among Implicit Personal Theories of Communication, Social Support and Loneliness. Human Communication, 11(4), 445-461.
&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as a “theory of theories,” Message Design Logic offers three different fundamental premises in reasoning about [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, J. (2002). Cultural Assumptions Underlying Message Design Logic: Premises of Development, Preference, and Understanding. Intercultural Communication Studies, XI(4), 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt; As author Barbara O’Keefe describes, Message Design Logic is “the kind of communication-constituting belief system the message producer relies on in reasoning from the goals sought to the message design used.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988"&gt;O'Keefe, B. J. (1988). The Logic of Message Design: Individual Differences in Reasoning about Communication. Communication Monographs, 55(1), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; These three premises — Expressive Logic, Conventional Logic, and Rhetorical Logic — are [[belief systems]] that communicators might utilize when designing [[messages]]. The message design logics, therefore, represent “internally consistent and developmentally ordered stages in the acquisition of working knowledge about the systematic properties of verbal messages.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As O’Keefe describes further, each premise is “associated with a constellation of related beliefs: a communication-constituting concept, a conception of the functional possibilities of communication, unit formation procedures, and principles of coherence.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; The underlying idea behind O’Keefe’s work is that “communication is not necessarily a uniform process.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

== Components ==
The three components of Message Design Logic are based on "individuals’ levels of cognitive complexity," and are expressed in messages that vary in organization, content, and effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Whether these components represent different levels of communication effectiveness is labeled as debatable by other communication scholars.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, L., &amp; Albrecht, T. L. (1996). Message design logic, social support, and mixed-status relationships. Western Journal of Communication, 60(4), 291-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expressive design logic ===
Seen as the simplest form of message production, the fundamental premise of Expressive Design Logic is that  “Language is a [[Media (communication)|medium]] for expressing thoughts and feelings.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; This premise is the simplest of the three logics and explains that someone says what they feel. As long as this feeling is conveyed in the message, the message is deemed successful. O’Keefe gives two reasons why individuals who operate under this design logic are very literal when it comes to impression in message design and interpretation. “First, they fail to appreciate that in communication, the process of [[expression (language)|expression]] can be made to serve other goals, and second, they interpret messages as independent units rather than as threads in an interaction fabric.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Individuals that communicate expressively do not recognize the idea that messages might be designed to induce particular reactions by the receiver. They believe that messages are taken straightforwardly by a receiver who has thoughts, feelings, or reactions that are to be communicated back to the sender. Through this idea there are only two possible relationships that can be held between the speaker's intentions and messages; 1) To fully and honestly express the speaker’s current mental state. 2) To convey a distorted version of the speaker’s mental state though editing or lying. Due to the extreme straightforwardness of expressive messages they may contain multiple facets that can be viewed as negative when discussing communicative effectiveness, such as pointless content (excessive knowledge of what the speaker feels or wants), [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancies]] (due to a thought being recycled), noncontingent threats or [[insults]] (simple announcements of punishments), or inoffensive but inappropriate comments (complimentary personal remarks inappropriately delivered).&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Ultimately, individuals using Expressive Design Logic believe that the element that unites a speaker’s messages is simply what is on the speaker’s mind, whether they are items of information from one encounter or items from a complex chain of associations.

=== Conventional design logic ===
The fundamental premise of Conventional Design Logic is that “communication is a game played cooperatively, according to socially conventional rules and procedures.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As opposed to the expressive design logic, the communicator using conventional design logic distinguishes between thought and expression.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; In this design logic, language is viewed as [[Instrumental value|means]] of expressing propositions that are “specified by the social effect one wants to achieve.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991"&gt;O’Keefe, B. J. (1991). Message design logic and the management of multiple goals. In K.
Tracy (Ed.), Understanding face-to-face interaction: Issues linking goals and
discourse (pp. 101-117). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice conventional design logic consider various contexts as having fixed parameters and therefore design messages based upon what is most appropriate to the context.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991" /&gt; This message designing is done under the format of [[cooperation]] between the speaker and hearer. Using this logic is particularly valuable to achieve particular goals. Communication then is the means by which the goals are achieved. For example, someone constructing a conventional message would relate the message most to the context (the particular situation at hand) in order to achieve certain goals.

=== Rhetorical design logic ===
Seen as the most elaborate way of constructing messages, the fundamental premise of Rhetorical Design Logic is that “communication is the creation and negotiation of social selves and situations.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; For communicators using this logic, messages are designed to portray what the speaker wants reality to reflect.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991" /&gt; Under this belief system, O’Keefe explains that “all meaning is treated as a matter of dramaturgical enactment and social negotiation.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As opposed to the conventional design logic, which says to design messages relevant to the given context, rhetorical design logic seeks to create the context using the designed messages. This creating of the context is accomplished using [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[negotiation]]. For coordination, rhetorical design seeks to repeatedly solve coordination problems in order to create the social reality.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; For negotiation, communication operates under the presumption that it can “strategically exploit” meaning. Rhetorical message producers always “seek to achieve consensus and social legitimation for the reality they speak,” thus having the possibility of negotiation always available.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Their messages are proactive rather than reactive, so they are designed towards effects rather than in response to the actions of others.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Rhetorical messages also normally contain “elaborating and contextualizing clauses and phrases that provide explicit definitions of the context.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Lastly, O’Keefe summarizes the internal coherence of rhetorical designed messages as deriving from “the elements being related by intersubjectively available, goal-oriented schemes.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

== Verification and other uses ==

Many other scholars have verified and used O’Keefe’s work for their own research . For example, Peterson and Albrecht uses Message Design Logic to posit the relationship between superiors’ and subordinates’ message design logic types.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; Likewise, another study done explored the relationships among individuals’ message design logics and their levels of social well-being.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Dr. Gwen Hullman used Message Design Logic to help in the study of perceptions of communication [[Skill|competence]]. The conclusion of her research in relation to message design was that, “speakers of rhetorical regulative messages were perceived as more effective, more appropriate, and were rated as more competent.”&lt;ref&gt;Hullman, G. A. (2004). Interpersonal Communication Motives and Message Design Logic:
Exploring Their Interaction on Perceptions of Competence. Communication Monographs, 71(2), 208-225.
&lt;/ref&gt; These findings reflect the ideas O’Keefe stated in her original work in that rhetorical speakers can better align their goals with their partner's goals.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

O’Keefe’s Message Design Logic has also been used in a study done in 2005 by Carmen Cortes, Chad Larson, and Dale Hample. Their study was designed to see if the difference in interpersonal construct differentiation reflected the sophistication with which they designed their messages.&lt;ref name="Cortes"&gt;Cortes, C., Larson, C., &amp; Hample, D. (2005). Relations Among Message Design Logic, Interpersonal Construct Differentiation, and Sex for Mexican and US Nationals. Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 34(1/2), 108-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Dr. Hullman’s study, this article resulted as O’Keefe had predicted in her 1988 study, in which O’Keefe said that people who are more differentiated also tend to employ more sophisticated logics in a challenging situation.&lt;ref name="Cortes" /&gt; What Cortes, Larson, and Hample found is that “differentiation reflects the sophistication with which a person perceives others, and a Message Design Logic is a knowledge structure regarding communication.” &lt;ref name="Cortes" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===

While critics of this theory are hard to find, Joy Hart of Louisville University reviews and examines O’Keefe’s work, including a full critique of assumptions she believes are being made. Hart claims that O’Keefe “assumes a developmental continuum for communication skill.”  &lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; She examines the assumption that individuals may progress to the rhetorical message design logic, which is the highest level of development. She critiques this assumption as it is seen through cultural and intercultural differences. A specific assumption which Hart criticizes is the proposition that if a person is surrounded by a social environment or culture in which negotiation is possible, then that person will proceed more quickly to the rhetorical message design logic.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;

Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

The '''National Wind Institute (NWI)''' at [[Texas Tech University]] (TTU) was established in December 2012, and is intended to serve as Texas Tech University’s intellectual hub for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, commercialization and education related to [[wind]] science, wind energy, [[wind engineering]] and wind hazard mitigation and serves faculty affiliates, students, and external partners.

In 2003, with support from the National Science Foundation, the first interdisciplinary Ph.D. program dedicated to wind science and engineering was developed. Later, the Texas Wind Energy Institute (TWEI) was established, and is a partnership between TTU and Texas State Technical College designed to develop education and career pathways to meet workforce and educational needs of the expanding wind energy industry. Partly funded by the Texas Workforce Commission. 
In an effort to streamline and to promote synergy, both WiSE and TWEI have now integrated to form the National Wind Institute.

NWI organizes and administers large multi-dimensional TTU wind-related research projects and serves as the contact point for major project sponsors and other external partners.

==History==
The Wind Science and Engineering (WiSE) Research Center was established in 1970 as the Institute for Disaster Research, following the F5 [[1970 Lubbock tornado|Lubbock tornado]] that caused 26 fatalities and over $100 million in damage.&lt;ref name=genesis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcbd.com/global/story.asp?s=3318493|title=1970 Tornado Creates the Texas Tech Wind Science and Engineering Center|accessdate=2009-04-18|publisher=[[KCBD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the aftermath of the [[tornado]], the WISE center developed the first comprehensive [[wind engineering]] report of its kind.&lt;ref name=genesis /&gt; In 2006, the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] was developed at TTU to update the original [[Fujita scale]] that was first introduced in 1971. In 2003, with support from the National Science Foundation, the first interdisciplinary Ph.D. program dedicated to wind science and engineering was developed. Later, the Texas Wind Energy Institute (TWEI) was established as a partnership between TTU and Texas State Technical College designed to develop education and career pathways to meet workforce and educational needs of the expanding wind energy industry. A Bachelor's degree program in Wind Energy was opened in Spring 2012 and now has more than 100 students in the process of completing the degree requirements.

Both WiSE and TWEI have now integrated to form the National Wind Institute (NWI).

==Research==

===Wind energy===
Some of the National Wind Institute's [[Wind power|wind energy]] research goals are the assessment of the risk and effects on [[wind turbine]] exposure to extreme wind events, the improvement of wind turbine design codes with emphasis on extreme wind events, and the analysis and testing of [[Public utility|utility]]-scale wind turbines for use in less-energetic wind conditions.&lt;ref name=windEnergy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wind.ttu.edu/WindEnergy/Overview.php |title=Wind Energy - Overview |accessdate=2009-04-18 |publisher=The Wind Science and Engineering Research Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319065422/http://www.wind.ttu.edu/WindEnergy/Overview.php |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NWI is also focused on the identification of advanced wind-driven water treatment and [[desalination]] systems for [[Municipality|municipal]] and other applications, as well as the full-scale testing of wind-driven water desalination systems and the development of modeling codes for integrated wind-water desalination systems.&lt;ref name=windEnergy /&gt;

===Debris impact===
The NWI Debris Impact Facility performs tests on [[Storm cellar|storm shelters]] and their various components to see if they meet established [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)l]] and International Code Council guidelines.&lt;ref name=stormShelters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/activities/homeandgarden/home/hometips/severeweather/tornado_shelters.html|title=Tornado Storm Shelters|accessdate=2009-04-18|publisher=weather.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427042111/http://www.weather.com/activities/homeandgarden/home/hometips/severeweather/tornado_shelters.html|archivedate=2009-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.depts.ttu.edu/nwi/research/DebrisImpact/index.php Debris Impact Facility] houses a high-powered air cannon that shoots [[Dimensional lumber|wooden two-by-fours]] at shelter walls and doors to simulate flying debris.&lt;ref name=stormShelters /&gt; The cannon is capable of producing simulated wind speeds of more than 250&amp;nbsp;mph and provides valuable impact resistance data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8894">'''Nutrient density''' identifies the proportion of [[nutrients]] in foods, with terms such as '''nutrient rich''' and  '''micronutrient dense''' referring to similar properties. Several different national and international standards have been developed and are in use (see [[Nutritional rating systems]]).

==Definition and usage==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[nutrient profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ Nutrient Profiling: Report of a WHO/IASO Technical Meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, accessed 10/15/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; classifies and/or ranks foods by their nutritional composition in order to promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/profiling/en/ Nutrient Profiling, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy.  Ordering foods by nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing foods by the proportion of nutrients in foods.  Some such comparisons can be the [[glycemic index]] and the [[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]].

Nutrient-dense foods such as [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are the opposite of [[energy density|energy-dense]] food (also called "[[empty calorie]]" food), such as [[alcohol]] and foods high in added [[sugar]] or processed [[cereals]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/nutrition/nutrition/dietary_guide/hgic4062.html Hunter, J. G., Cason, K. L., Nutrient Density, Clemson University, 2006(November), accessed 10/15/2014.  Nutrient density is defined as "a measure of the nutrients provided per calorie of food, or the ratio of nutrients to calories (energy)."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B758G-4HP5YFV-D/2/c86659719922a2736490366333062119 Darmon, N., Darmon, M., Maillot, M., Drewnowski, A., ''A Nutrient Density Standard for Vegetables and Fruits: Nutrients per Calorie and Nutrients per Unit Cost'', Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 105(12),2005 (December), 1881–1887, DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2005.09.005, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond its use to distinguish different ''types'' of food from each other, nutrient density allows comparison to be made for different examples or samples of the same kind of food. Nutrient density is correlated with soil quality and mineralization levels of the soil, although the relationship is complex and incorporates other dimensions.

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] reported in 2013 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several indicators of nutrient quality have been summarized by the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Drewnowski, A., Defining nutrient density: Development and validation of the nutrient rich foods index. J Am Coll Nutr. 2009; 28(suppl 4):421S-426S.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published February 24, 2010, doi: 10.3945/ajcn.2010.28450D]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nutrient Rich Food Index has been developed by a research coalition involving food and nutrition practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Trichterborn J, Harzer G, Kunz C. Nutrient profiling and food label claims: Evaluation of dairy products in three major European countries. Eur J Clin Nutr. 2011;65(9): 1032-1038.&lt;/ref&gt;  This index uses nutrient profiles that have been validated against accepted measures of a healthy diet, such as the Healthy Eating Index created by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672(12)01993-4/pdf Position Paper, Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2013(February), 113(2), 307-317.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==International standards==

The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator (NPSC) in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is a calculator for determining whether health claims can be made for a food by its reference to the Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC).  It is defined by the FSANZ Board, which operates under the FSANZ Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/labelling/pages/nutrientprofilingcalculator/Default.aspx FSANZ Board, Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom Ofcom nutrient profiling model provides "a single score for any given food product, based on calculating the number of points for ‘negative’ nutrients which can be offset by points for ‘positive’ nutrients."  A 2007 UK-commissioned review of nutrient profiling models commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency identified over 40 different schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealth.ox.ac.uk/bhfhprg/publicationsandreports/acad-publications/bhfcpnppublished/nutrientprofilemodel Rayner, M., Scarborough, P., Lobtein, P., The UK Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model, October 2009, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] reviews scientific and operational issues related to human nutrition, specifically when developing world populations are impacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ World Health Organization, Nutrient profiling: report of a technical meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, 20 pages, Publication date: 2011], {{ISBN|978 92 4 150220 7}}, accessed 10/15/2014, downloadable as a PDF from http://www.who.int/entity/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Okinawa diet''' describes the [[Okinawan cuisine|eating habits of the indigenous people of the Ryukyu Islands]] (belonging to [[Japan]]), which is believed to cause their [[Longevity in Okinawa|exceptional longevity]]. It is also the name of a weight-loss diet based on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://211.76.170.15/server/APJCN/Volume10/vol10.2/Sho.pdf |title=History and characteristics of Okinawan longevity food |author=Hiroko Sho |journal=Asia Pacific J Clin Nutr |year=2001 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-6047.2001.00235.x |volume=10 |pages=159–164 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113035029/http://211.76.170.15/server/APJCN/Volume10/vol10.2/Sho.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2012 |pmid=11710358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional diet of the islanders contains 30% green and yellow vegetables. Although the traditional Japanese diet usually includes large quantities of rice, the traditional Okinawa diet consists of smaller quantities of [[rice]]; instead the staple is the purple-fleshed Okinawan [[Sweet potato#Asia|sweet potato]].  The Okinawan diet has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.&lt;ref name="Willcox2007" /&gt;

The traditional diet also includes a tiny amount of fish (less than half a serving per day) and more in the way of soy and other legumes (6% of total caloric intake). Pork is highly valued, yet eaten very rarely.  Every part of the pig is eaten, including internal organs.

Between a sample from Okinawa where life expectancies at birth and 65 were the longest in Japan, and a sample from Akita Prefecture where the life expectancies were much shorter, intakes of calcium, iron and vitamins A, B1, B2, and C, and the proportion of energy from proteins and fats were significantly higher in Okinawa than in Akita. Conversely, intakes of carbohydrates and salt were lower in Okinawa than in Akita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1407826 | volume=8 | title=Nutrition for the Japanese elderly. | year=1992 | journal=Nutr Health | pages=165–75 | doi=10.1177/026010609200800312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity of pork consumption per person a year in Okinawa is larger than that of the Japanese national average. For example, the quantity of pork consumption per person a year in Okinawa in 1979 was  {{convert|7.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} which exceeded by about 50% that of the Japanese national average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110000220190/en ''Economic Structure of Local, Regional and National Hog Markets in the Self-Sufficient Region-Okinawa's Case'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pig's feet, ears, and stomach are considered healthy everyday foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://211.76.170.15/server/APJCN/Volume10/vol10.2/Sho.pdf |title=History and characteristics of Okinawan longevity food |author=Hiroko Sho |journal=Asia Pacific J Clin Nutr |year=2001 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-6047.2001.00235.x |volume=10 |pages=159–164 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113035029/http://211.76.170.15/server/APJCN/Volume10/vol10.2/Sho.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2012 |pmid=11710358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dietary intake of Okinawans compared to other Japanese circa 1950 shows that Okinawans consumed: fewer total calories (1785 vs. 2068), less polyunsaturated fat (4.8% of calories vs. 8%), less rice (154g vs. 328g), significantly less wheat, barley and other grains (38g vs. 153g), less sugars (3g vs. 8g), more legumes (71g vs. 55g), significantly less fish (15g vs. 62g), significantly less meat and poultry (3g vs. 11g), less eggs (1g vs. 7g), less dairy (&lt;1g vs. 8g), much more sweet potatoes (849g vs. 66g), less other potatoes (2g vs. 47g), less fruit (&lt;1g vs. 44g), and no pickled vegetables (0g vs. 42g).

&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the Okinawans circa 1950 ate sweet potatoes for 849 grams of the 1262 grams of food that they consumed, which constituted 69% of their total calories.&lt;ref name="Willcox2007" /&gt;

An Okinawan reaching 100 years of age has typically had a diet consistently averaging about one calorie per gram of food and has a [[Body Mass Index (BMI)|BMI]] of 20.4 in early adulthood and middle age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The old people's village on the island of immortals|url=https://hubslide.com/svenska-dagbladet/the-old-peoples-village-on-the-island-of-immortals-s5710afaf98bd508a03dafd66.html|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their high life expectancy, islanders are noted for their low mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. Wilcox (2007) compared age-adjusted mortality of Okinawans versus Americans and found that, during 1995, an average Okinawan was 8 times less likely to die from coronary heart disease, 7 times less likely to die from prostate cancer, 6.5 times less likely to die from breast cancer, and 2.5 times less likely to die from colon cancer than an average American of the same age.&lt;ref name="Willcox2007" /&gt;

The traditional Okinawan diet as described above was widely practiced on the islands until about the 1960s. Since then, dietary practices have been shifting towards Western and Japanese patterns, with fat intake rising from about 6% to 27% of total caloric intake and the sweet potato being supplanted with rice and bread.&lt;ref name="Willcox2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Okinawan Diet: Health Implications of a Low-Calorie, Nutrient-Dense, Antioxidant-Rich Dietary Pattern Low in Glycemic Load |url=http://www.jacn.org/content/28/4_Supplement_1/500S.long|author=D.

== Weight loss diet ==
The diet consists of a relatively high [[food energy|energy]] intake, and contains similar foods to the traditional Okinawan diet. The principal focus of the diet consists of knowing the food energy density of each food item.

The proponents of this diet divide food into four categories based on caloric density. The "featherweight" foods, less than or equal to {{convert|0.8|Cal/g}} which one can eat freely without major concern, the "lightweight" foods with a caloric density from 0.8 to 1.5 calories per gram which one should eat in moderation, the "middleweight" foods with a caloric density from 1.5 to 3.0 calories per gram which one should eat only while carefully monitoring portion size and the "heavyweight" foods from 3 to 9 calories per gram which one should eat only sparingly.&lt;ref name="The Okinawa Diet Plan 2004"&gt;''The Okinawa Diet Plan'', Bradley Willcox, MD, D.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to biochemistry:

'''Biochemistry''' &amp;ndash; study of [[chemistry|chemical]] processes in living [[organism]]s, including living matter. [[Biochemistry]] governs all living organisms and living processes.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Applications of biochemistry==
* Testing
** [[Ames test]] &amp;ndash; salmonella bacteria is exposed to a chemical under question (a food additive, for example), and changes in the way the bacteria grows are measured. This test is useful for screening chemicals to see if they mutate the structure of DNA and by extension identifying their potential to cause cancer in humans.
** [[Pregnancy test]] &amp;ndash; one uses a urine sample and the other a blood sample. Both detect the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation of the embryo into the uterine walls and accumulates.
** [[Breast cancer screening]] &amp;ndash; identification of risk by testing for mutations in two genes&amp;mdash;Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1) and the Breast Cancer-2 gene (BRCA2)&amp;mdash;allow a woman to schedule increased screening tests at a more frequent rate than the general population.
** [[Prenatal genetic testing]] &amp;ndash; testing the fetus for potential genetic defects, to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome or birth defects such as spina bifida.
** [[Phenylketonuria#Screening and presentation|PKU test]] &amp;ndash; Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder in which the individual is missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Absence of this enzyme allows the buildup of phenylalanine, which can lead to mental retardation.
* [[Genetic engineering]] &amp;ndash; taking a gene from one organism and placing it into another. Biochemists inserted the gene for human insulin into bacteria.  The bacteria, travels through the process of translation, create human insulin.
* [[Cloning]] &amp;ndash; Dolly the sheep was the first mammal ever cloned from adult animal cells. The cloned sheep was, of course, genetically identical to the original adult sheep.  This clone was created by taking cells from the udder of a 6-year-old ewe and growing them in the lab.
* [[Gene therapy]] &amp;ndash; a modified or healthy gene is inserted into the organism to replace a disease-causing gene. Commonly a virus that has been altered to carry human DNA is used to deliver the healthy gene to the targeted cells of the patient. This process was first used successfully in 1990 on a 4-year-old patient who lacked an immune system due to a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

The '''political economy of communications''', news, or media, is a particular branch in [[Communication studies]] or [[media studies]] which studies the power relations ([[political economy]]) that constitute the communication of information from the [[mass media]] to its publics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media|last=Flew|first=Terry|last2=Smith|first2=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-900550-5|location=Don Mills, ON|pages=1–26, 57–75, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by media and political economy scholars, such as [[Dallas Walker Smythe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Melody, B.|year=1994|title=Dallas Smythe: Pioneer in the political economy of communications|editor=T.

== Influences ==

One of the most early modern works in the political economy of communications are [[Harold Innis]]' works which were compiled in the book ''[[Empire and Communications]]''. This directly inspired [[Marshall McLuhan]], a colleague of Innis at the University of Toronto, who would later be made famous for the dictum "the medium is the message". Subsequent PEC approaches have been heavily influenced by Marxist thought and democratic politics, as it questions powers of and within communications against the realization of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Jonathan|date=2014-06-01|title=Critical political economy of communications: A mid-term review|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/mcp/2014/00000010/00000002/art00008|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|volume=10|issue=2|pages=189–202|doi=10.1386/macp.10.2.189_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] Thought- The [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] of PEC dictates it to often criticize [[capitalism]] for its effect on media and democracy, which originates from the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School|critical theory]] works of [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christan|date=2014|title=WikiLeaks and the Critique of the Political Economy|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=8|issue=1932–8036/2014FEA0002|pages=2718–2732}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common critique of critical political economy (often from the [[cultural studies]] approach) is that, like [[Marxism|Marx]], it [[Fetishism|fetishizes]] [[capitalism]] and is deterministic [[Technological determinism|technologically]] and/or [[Economic determinism|economically]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* [[Democracy|Democratic Politics]]- PEC views media and information as the ultimate democratizer of power, and thus includes social [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] as a criterion. Ultimately, this means that PEC encourages [[media reform]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and government intervention in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Main Topics of Study ==

[[File:News Corp logo 2013.svg|thumb|Logo of [[News Corp]], a mass media conglomerate and a subject of concentrated ownership. ]]
* [[Concentration of media ownership|Media ownership]]- Concentration of ownership in media industries as a result of [[Technological convergence|convergence]] and [[Conglomeration|media conglomeration]] under [[neoliberal economics]] have become a concern for media [[Diversity (business)|diversity]] and [[Democracy|democratic discourse]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Support mechanisms- [[Advertising]], [[marketing]], [[Subscription business model|subscription]], [[social media]], and [[crowdfunding]] [[revenue]]s are examples of economic support for media organizations. Such mechanisms influence what types of [[Content (media)|content]] are published or not published, the nature of the [[commodity]] (content vs. [[the audience]] vs. [[advertisers]]) and are thus relevant to PEC studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* [[Government policy]]- Policy [[Media regulation|regulates]] media and its economics in terms of ownership, affecting how [[Creative industries|media industries]] operate as well as the role of media in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Journalism/News Media ==

As [[Journalism|journalism/news media]] is the core to the functioning of democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|title=Normative Theories of the Media: Journalism in Democratic Societies|last=Christians|first=Clifford G.|last2=Glasser|first2=Theodore L.|last3=McQuail|first3=Denis|last4=Nordenstreng|first4=Kaarle|last5=White|first5=Robert A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252034237|doi=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEC works towards the goal of "healthy journalism."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|date=2012-10-01|title=Farewell to Journalism?|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=5–6|pages=614–626|doi=10.1080/17512786.2012.683273|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for democracy, the current state of news media around the world and especially that of [[Media of the United States|the United States]], falls short of the general consensus (among media scholars and democratic theory) on what is considered to be healthy [[journalism]]. This is due in part to the overwhelming amount of [[public relations]] material being posed as [[News media|news]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is in the interest of PEC that journalism instead provide a "rigorous account" of those in power, meet the information needs of all classes and people, be truthful, and act as an early warning system by providing a "wide range of informed opinions on the most important issues of our time."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== New Media ==

[[Mass media|The mass media]] are undoubtedly experiencing considerable changes in platform, technology, and economic structure (e.g., [[crowdfunding]], [[social media]]) as the [[digital era]] continues to shift people toward "[[New media|new" media]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional financial configurations and business models have been destabilized by this transformation. However, new mechanisms of power have emerged from this more open system of information and news creation. The availability of information can now be skewed or influenced through "search, aggregation, and digital distribution infrastructures" (p.&amp;nbsp;493).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picard|first=Robert G.|date=2014-09-03|title=Twilight or New Dawn of Journalism?|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=15|issue=5|pages=500–510|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2014.895530|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Mosco's definition of political economic studies, where the "production, distribution, and consumption of resources, including communication resources” are essential, thus remains relevant even in times of [[new media]], since a new [[Network economy|(network) economy/society]] forms its ''own'' power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rise of the network society|last=Manuel.|first=Castells|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9780631221401|oclc=254487176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International encyclopedia of communication online|last=1949-|first=Donsbach, Wolfgang|last2=Association.|first2=International Communication|last3=(Firm)|first3=Wiley-Blackwell|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Wiley/Blackwell|isbn=9781405131995|oclc=271856987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/Syllabi/Spring%202010/COM%20330/BBarrettPoliticaleconomy.pdf|title=Approaches to Media|last=Boyd-Barrett|first=Oliver|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=186–192|chapter=The political economy approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1738">'''Pose space deformation''' is a [[computer animation]] technique which is used to deform a mesh on skeleton-driven animation. Common use of this technique is to deform the shape of a mesh (for example, an arm) according to the angle of the joint (in this case, the elbow) bent. Although the name is commonly called '''Pose space deformation''' on many scholarly articles, 3D animation software rarely uses that name. On [[Autodesk Maya]], it's implemented under the name '''Pose Deformer''', and on [[Blender (software)|Blender]], it's implemented as '''Shape Keys'''. The first famous application of this technique was the cloth's movement on the first episode of the animated film [[The Animatrix]].

'''Pseudophysics''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] practice using the language of [[physics]] or discussing issues related to or pertinent to physics to promote ideas which are either incoherent or contradictory to known physics (experimental phenomenology). According to physicists, skeptics, and science writers, pseudophysics tends to be promoted by so-called "[[crank (person)|cranks]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.about.com/b/2012/02/17/physicscranks.htm&lt;/ref&gt; whose ideas lack [[peer review]], lack [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]], and/or blatantly contradict scientific facts and experimental results. [[Mathematical physicist]] [[John C. Baez]] famously invented a [[crackpot index]] to give an idea of what sort of claims and rhetoric were commonplace among pseudophysics proposals he had come across.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">The '''quadrivium''' (plural: quadrivia&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14950-wisdom |title=Wisdom |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]. The word is [[Latin]], meaning ''four ways'', and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to [[Boethius]] or [[Cassiodorus]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Part I: The Age of Augustine". ND.edu. 2010. [http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hwp205.htm ND205].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrivium (education)". ''[[Britannica Online]]''. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485943/quadrivium EB].
&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the [[trivium]] and the quadrivium comprised the seven [[liberal arts]] (based on thinking skills),&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Quadrivium|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinguished from the practical arts (such as [[medicine]] and [[architecture]]).

The quadrivium consisted of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]]. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]. In turn, the quadrivium was considered preparatory work for the study of [[philosophy]] (sometimes called the "liberal art ''par excellence''")&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Coit Gilman|Gilman, Daniel Coit]], et al. (1905). ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''. Lemma "Arts, Liberal".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]].

==Origins==
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by [[Plato]] in [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music). &lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;
The quadrivium is implicit in early [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] writings and in the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]], although the term ''quadrivium'' was not used until [[Boethius]], early in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les Arts Libéraux dans l'Antiquité Classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts Libéraux et Philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Proclus]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold.  A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion.  Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus. ''A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements'', xii. trans. Glenn Raymond Morrow. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-691-02090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Medieval usage==
At many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of [[Master of Arts]] (after the [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B.Phil]] and [[British degree abbreviations|B.Litt.]] degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).

The study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by [[Proclus]] (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Craig (2001). ''The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology, and Music''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geometry and cosmology on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, Laura Ackerman (1994). ''History, Prophecy and the Stars: Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350–1420. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of [[harmonic]]s, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a [[monochord]]. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.

==Modern usage==
In modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of [[number]] and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in [[space]], music was number in [[time]], and astronomy was number in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Morris Kline]] classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Morris (1953). "The Sine of G Major". In ''Mathematics in Western Culture''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This schema is sometimes referred to as "classical education", but it is more accurately a [[Renaissance of the 12th century|development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance]] with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the [[Classical education movement]] and at the independent [[Oundle School]], in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge |title=Oundle School – Improving Intellectual Challenge |date=27 October 2014 |website=The Boarding Schools' Association}}&lt;br /&gt;Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at [[King's College London]] on "[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx The Future of Liberal Arts]" at schools and universities.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''R/V ''Rachel Carson''''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]]. The vessel is part of the [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System|UNOLS]] fleet. It is capable of conducting operations within the [[Salish Sea]] and coastal waters of the western United States and British Columbia. She can accommodate up to 28 persons, including the crew, for day operations, while up to 13 can be accommodated for multi-day operations.&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"/&gt;

==Service history==

===R/V ''Aora'', 2003–2016=== 
The ship was originally launched in May 2003 at the Macduff Shipyard in [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]], Scotland, as the 
R/V ''Aora'', a [[fisheries research vessel]].&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/RV_Rachel_Carson |title=R/V Rachel Carson |date=2018 |website=University of Washington School of Oceanography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was based at the [[University Marine Biological Station Millport]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverclydephotography.uk/2010/12/rv-aora.html |title=R/V Aora |last=Ward |first=Gerard |date=6 December 2010 |website=River Clyde Photography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the station was closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx |title=Millport History |website=[[Field Studies Council]] |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R/V ''Rachel Carson'', 2017–present=== 
In 2015 the University of Washington's School of Oceanography wanted to replace the fifty-year old {{ship|RV|Clifford A. Barnes}}, but were unable to raise the funds required to design and build a replacement. In December 2016 they found the ''Aora'' for sale on a yacht-trading website.&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |title=UW launches 1st voyage Saturday on bigger, better research ship |last=Farley |first=Glenn  |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[KING-TV]] |access-date=25 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407042551/https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |archive-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irso.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irso.info/wp-content/uploads/Russell-RV-Rachel-Carson-Presentation-26-Sept-2018-IRSO-copy.pdf |title=R/V Rachel Carson |first=Doug |last=Russell |date=26 September 2018 |website=International Research Ship Operators |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an inspection in March 2017, the ship was purchased for $1.07m on 8 August 2017,&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt; with the aid of a $1m gift.&lt;ref name="new-uw-vessel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/10/new-uw-vessel-rv-rachel-carson-will-explore-regional-waters/ |title=New UW vessel, RV Rachel Carson, will explore regional waters |last=Hickey |first=Hannah |date=May 10, 2018 |website=UW News |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme of maintenance and some modifications at the MacDuff yard were completed in October, and the ''Rachel Carson'' was transported by ship from [[Rotterdam]] to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] by early November.&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macduffshipdesign.com/news/the-rachel-carson-transported-to-the-university-of-washington/ |title=The "Rachel Carson" transported to the University of Washington |date=16 December 2017 |website=MacDuff Ship Design |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then transported to the University of Washington, arriving on 28 December. After further preparations and modifications the ship entered service on 7 April 2018,&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt; with a five-day cruise in [[Puget Sound]] to collect samples for monitoring by the Washington Ocean Acidification Center.&lt;ref name="new-uw-vessel"/&gt; She was accepted as a UNOLS vessel in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet on 24 July.&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt;

== Incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia ==
For both men and women, [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of schizophrenia onset peaks at multiple points across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For men, the highest frequency of incidence onset occurs in the early twenties and there is evidence of a second peak in the mid-thirties. For women, there is a similar pattern with peaks in the early twenties and middle age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Richard J.|last2=Addington|first2=Jean|last3=Viswanathan|first3=Ananth C.|last4=Lewis|first4=Shôn W.|last5=Cotter|first5=Jack|last6=Yung|first6=Alison R.|last7=Abel|first7=Kathryn M.|date=2016-02-16|title=How Age and Gender Predict Illness Course in a First-Episode Nonaffective Psychosis Cohort|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.14m09369|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|pages=e283–e289|doi=10.4088/jcp.14m09369|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also demonstrated a tertiary peak for women in the early sixties. Men have higher frequency rates of onset than women from the early twenties to middle age, and women have higher frequency rates of onset starting in late middle age. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castle|first=David J.|last2=Wessely|first2=Simon|last3=Murray|first3=Robin M.|date=May 1993|title=Sex and Schizophrenia: Effects of Diagnostic Stringency, and Associations with Premorbid Variables|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=05|pages=658–664|doi=10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies of [[prevalence]] rates of schizophrenia estimate that the lifetime likelihood of developing the disorder is 0.3%-0.7%, and did not find evidence of sex differences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGrath|first=J.|last2=Saha|first2=S.|last3=Chant|first3=D.|last4=Welham|first4=J.|date=2008-05-14|title=Schizophrenia: A Concise Overview of Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxn001|journal=Epidemiologic Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxn001|issn=0193-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Sukanta|last2=Chant|first2=David|last3=Welham|first3=Joy|last4=McGrath|first4=John|date=2005-05-31|title=A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=2|issue=5|pages=e141|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|issn=1549-1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical presentation ==
Symptom expression systematically differs between men and women. Women are more likely to experience high levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., low mood, [[anhedonia]], fatigue) at illness onset and over the course of illness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Men are more likely to experience more [[Negative symptom|negative symptoms]] than women at illness onset. There is conflicting evidence related to sex differences in the expression of [[positive symptoms]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some studies have found that women are more likely to experience positive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Jill M.|last2=Link|first2=Bruce G.|date=1988-01|title=Gender and the expression of schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-3956(88)90078-7|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=22|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1016/0022-3956(88)90078-7|issn=0022-3956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=C.Z.|last2=Wu Qianjin|date=1994-02|title=Popula tion Aging in China: The Demographic Implications|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000944559403000103|journal=China Report|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–51|doi=10.1177/000944559403000103|issn=0009-4455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found no significant sex differences in the expression of positive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Vera A.|last2=Castle|first2=David J.|last3=Jablensky|first3=Assen V.|date=2008-01|title=Do Women Express and Experience Psychosis Differently from Men?

== Course of illness and treatment outcomes ==
Age at illness onset likely contributes to observed sex differences in course of illness and treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Increased negative and [[Schizophrenia|cognitive symptoms]] and poorer overall treatment outcomes are both related to younger age at onset, while fewer negative and cognitive symptoms are associated with older age at onset.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Linda S.|last2=Harrow|first2=Martin|last3=Rosen|first3=Cherise|last4=Faull|first4=Robert|last5=Strauss|first5=Gregory P.|date=2008-11|title=Sex differences in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: a 20-year longitudinal study of psychosis and recovery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=6|pages=523–529|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|issn=0010-440X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with the differences patterns of symptom expression observed in men and women and the relative age of onset for each gender. Men are more likely to experience poorer overall outcomes than women because of the relationship between younger age at onset and symptom severity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Clinical trials examining sex differences in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications found greater rates of symptom reduction in women compared to men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, women are at a greater risk for experiencing weight gain and developing [[metabolic syndrome]] as a result of antipsychotic medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=Donald C.|last2=Sullivan|first2=Lisa M.|last3=McEvoy|first3=Joseph P.|last4=Meyer|first4=Jonathan M.|last5=Nasrallah|first5=Henry A.|last6=Daumit|first6=Gail L.|last7=Lamberti|first7=Steven|last8=D'Agostino|first8=Ralph B.|last9=Stroup|first9=Thomas S.|date=2005-12|title=A comparison of ten-year cardiac risk estimates in schizophrenia patients from the CATIE study and matched controls|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|journal=Schizophrenia Research|volume=80|issue=1|pages=45–53|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|issn=0920-9964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors contributing to sex differences ==

=== Biological factors ===
The steroids and hormones associated with [[Sexual differentiation|sex differentiation]] during [[Prenatal development|fetal development]] have critical effects on neuronal development in humans, and there is evidence that these hormones have implications for sex differences in brain abnormalities observed in adults with schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies have revealed more severe brain damage in men diagnosed with schizophrenia than women.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-05|title=Effects of diagnosis, laterality, and gender on brain morphology in schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=152|issue=5|pages=704–714|doi=10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, larger lateral and third ventricles and reduced volumes of critical regions such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[Prefrontal lobe|prefrontal]] cortical regions have been observed in men.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These brain abnormalities likely contribute to the observed short-term and long-term memory deficits in men diagnosed with schizophrenia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Han|first1=M.|last2=Huang|first2=X.

=== Social and environmental factors ===

==== Social cognition and social functioning ====
Premorbid [[Social skills|social functioning]] and [[social cognition]], robust predictors of relapse in this population, differ significantly between men and women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsner|first=Michael S.|last2=Arbitman|first2=Marina|last3=Lisker|first3=Alexander|last4=Ponizovsky|first4=Alexander M.|date=2011-10-02|title=Ten-year quality of life outcomes among patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder II.

==== Substance abuse and dependence ====
Substance abuse is also highly correlated with poorer functional outcomes and can significantly influence the course of illness. Current research estimates that 36% of men have a history of illicit substance use versus 16% of women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablensky|first=Assen|last2=McGrath|first2=John|last3=Herrman|first3=Helen|last4=Castle|first4=David|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Evans|first6=Mandy|last7=Carr|first7=Vaughan|last8=Morgan|first8=Vera|last9=Korten|first9=Ailsa|date=2000-04|title=Psychotic Disorders in Urban Areas: An Overview of the Study on Low Prevalence Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/j.1440-1614.2000.00728.x|journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=34|issue=2|pages=221–236|doi=10.1080/j.1440-1614.2000.00728.x|issn=0004-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine dependence is also highly prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">The '''sociology of Jewry''' involves the application of [[sociological theory]] and method to the study of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]]. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social patterns within Jewish groups and communities; [[American Jewry]], [[Israeli Jews]] and Jewish life in the [[diaspora]]. Sociological studies of the Jewish religion include religious membership, ritual and denominational patterns. Notable journals include ''[[Jewish Social Studies]]'', ''[[The Jewish Journal of Sociology]]'' and ''[[Contemporary Jewry]].

==Emergence of the discipline==

===Beginnings: 1930s-1950s===
Sociology of Jewry initially emerged in the United States in the 1930s beginning with the 1938 publication of ''Jewish Social Studies'', sponsored by the Conference of Jewish Relations. The Journal's mission was "to promote, by means of scientific research, a better understanding of the position of Jews in the modern world." And the later publication of ''The Jewish Journal of Sociology'' in 1958 was due to the "few opportunities... for publishing academic and scientific studies of the sociology of Jews."&lt;ref name=Heilman1982&gt;Heilman, Samuel C. "The sociology of American Jewry: The last ten years." ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 8, no. 1 (1982): 135-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and development: 1950s-present===
In 1955, sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] noted that the discipline was underdeveloped, stating that there were far more "Jewish sociologists" than "sociologists of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour. "Jewish Sociologists and Sociologists of the Jews." ''Jewish Social Studies'' (1955): 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subfield began to grow in the late 1960s and 1970s. A professional organization was formed, namely the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ). In 1975, a new academic journal was founded as well, ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]''.

Contributing to this growth was the work of [[Marshall Sklare]], now considered one of the founding figures in the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack Nusan. "The Sociology of Jewry: Blueprints for the future from contemporary designs." ''Contemporary Jewry'' 4, no. 1 (1977): 24-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Sklare and [[Joseph Greenblum]]’s 1967 study of Jewish identity in “Lakeville” is considered one of the most notable works of its kind. The sociological study of intergroup relations and the theories proposed by [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Daniel P. Moynihan]] is also thought to have contributed to the growth of the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Dashefsky, Arnold, Bernard Lazerwitz, and Ephraim Tabory.

Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formation of the ASSJ====
The idea for the formation of a professional organization for scholars specializing in the sociology of Jewry first surfaced in 1966; the concept was discussed by [[Werner J. Cahnman]] and [[Norman L. Friedman]] at an American Sociological Association (ASA) conference.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman L. "Conception and Birth of the Association for the Sociological Study of Jewry," ''Ethnic Forum'' 6 (1986): 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The association was informally launched by Norman Friedman and [[Bernard Lazerwitz]] in 1970; the event, titled "The Sociological Study of Jewry" took place at the ASA annual conference. Sociologists [[Solomon Poll]], [[Mervin Verbit]] and [[Arnold Dashevsky]] submitted a motion to establish a formal group; the motion was voted upon and accepted. The new group, the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ or ASSSJ) was launched and formally met the following year. The group has since organized annual conferences, established the academic journal ''Contemporary Jewry'', founded the ''ASSJ Newsletter'' and honors exceptional scholars in the field with the [[Marshall Sklare Award]].&lt;ref name=waxmanassj&gt;Waxman, Chaim I."[https://books.google.com/books?id=0s_QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lGnh34psjS&amp;sig=IpTbg8GEyHoMQJ3zw210i3-JDro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5N9sU9vRGMe2yASH5YGoAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCA The Professional Dilemma of Jewish Social Scientists: The Case of the ASSJ]."

Swatos, Jr. Hartford Institute for Religion Research. Accessed May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ASSJ and ''Contemporary Jewry'' are dominated by sociologists and sociological studies - all but one of the organization's presidents earned a doctorate in sociology, the other received a doctorate in psychology&lt;ref name=Blasi/&gt; - the focus has not been restricted to sociology alone. Studies involving other social sciences and history are included as well, and professionals from those disciplines have joined as members, contributors and honorees.&lt;ref name=waxmanassj/&gt;

==General theories==

===American Jewry===
According to sociologist [[Samuel Heilman]], there are three major theoretical approaches in studying the sociology of American Jewry in particular:
*''Uniqueness of Judaism'' and ''Particularism vs. Universalism'' - a popular theoretical approach towards understanding contemporary American Jewry has been the notion that more than anything else Judaism as a religion accounts for the social situation of U.S. Jews today.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''Judaism: A Sociology.'' Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The current social and political decisions of the Jewish community are rooted in the response to the inevitable conflict between Jewish religious values on one hand, and secular American life on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles S. ''The Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, religion and family in American Jewish life.'' Jewish publication society of America, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Milton Himmelfarb]], focus less on the Jewish religion per se and focus on the tension produced by balancing the particularism of the Jewish tradition vs. the universalism of American modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton. ''The Jews of Modernity.'' New York, NY: Basic Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marginal culture'' - in the 1940s and 1950s, some scholars, such as [[Milton M. Goldberg]], saw Jewish life in America as a successful "marginal culture," following the "[[marginal man theory]]" of [[Robert E. Park]] and [[Everett Stonequist]] popular at the time&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, Werner, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6W7oL3x1qAC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Error Without Trial: Psychological Research on Antisemitism].'' Vol. 2. Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Community and organizations'' - a third approach stems from the work of political scientist [[Daniel J. Elazar]] and focuses and the underlying dynamics behind the decision making within Jewish community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, Daniel Judah. ''Community and polity: The organizational dynamics of American Jewry.'' Jewish Publication Society, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other theoretical approaches have been advanced they have not majorly impacted the discipline's research agenda.&lt;ref name=Heilman1982/&gt;

==Applied sociology==
[[Samuel Klausner]], a former president of the ASSJ, noted that the sociology of Jewry is more an applied social science than a theoretical one. For Klausner, theories developed in sociology may help explain any society, not just a Jewish one. The contribution of the sociology of Jewry therefore is the application of the science, such as its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Samuel Z. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=TLSKRqkGMToC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RGjjdeUVLR&amp;sig=wI1-V_RSkJ3tQNEAZMCv6qNfqeM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GuBsU4_fO86wyASMg4LACw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK What is conceptually special about a sociology of Jewry]." ''Contemporary Anarchism''. Ed. Terry M. Perlin. Transaction Publishers. 1987. Accessed May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, stress that the subfield is a part of general [[comparative sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Zenner, Walter P. "American jewry in the light of middleman minority theories." Contemporary Jewry 5, no. 1 (1980): 11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syllabi collections==

===1946 syllabus===
In 1946, [[Kurt H. Wolff]], a student of [[Karl Mannheim]], published “An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews” in ''[[Social Forces]]'', a notable sociology journal. Wolff's aim was to provide an aid to including material on Jews in courses on race relations, social disorganization, minorities, and/or introductory sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Kurt H. "An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews." Social Forces (1946): 451-461.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff's syllabus focused on three topics:
*Demographic changes following the aftermath of [[World War II]] and the [[holocaust]]
*The "ethnic identifiability" of Jews
*[[Antisemitism]]

Later scholars have noted that Wolff's syllabus on the Sociology of Jewry sought to study external structures but ignored the internal dynamics of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007&gt;Burstein, Paul. "[http://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/sociology_of_jewry.pdf The Sociology of Jewry: Syllabi and Instructional Materials.]" ''ASA Resource Materials For Teaching''. American Sociological Association. Washington, DC. 2007. Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 ASA syllabi collection===
In 1992, Rabbi [[Jack Nusan Porter]] edited the first syllabus collection and curriculum guide on the Sociology of Jewry. The collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA). The collection included individual syllabi on the sociology of Jews from 34 colleges and universities. However, Porter found that many of the syllabi focused exclusively on Jewish life in America. And only 10 out of 34 syllabi were from sociology departments.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack N. 1998. The Sociology of Jewry: A Curriculum Guide. 2nd ed. Washington, DC: American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 ASA syllabi collection===
[[Paul Burstein]] of the [[University of Washington]] compiled an updated collection of syllabi on the sociology of Jewry. This collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) in 2007. In his work, Burstein focuses on the following themes:
*Comparative historical approach, examining changing and evolving patterns of Jewish life in the last few hundred years
*Jewish life in North America, though focusing mostly on the United States
*Jewish life in Israel
*The [[Holocaust]]

Burstein notes gaps in specific areas. For example, while Black-Jewish relations in the U.S. is covered in the syllabi, relations between Jews and other groups is not. Also, there are few areas covered outside of American and Israeli Jewry.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">In [[3D computer graphics|realtime computer graphics]], a '''texture atlas''' (also called a '''sprite sheet''' or an '''image sprite''') is an image containing a collection of smaller images, usually packed together to reduce the atlas size.&lt;ref name="nvidia"&gt;{{cite web |title=SDK White Paper Improve Batching Using Texture Atlases |url=http://download.nvidia.com/developer/NVTextureSuite/Atlas_Tools/Texture_Atlas_Whitepaper.pdf |publisher=Nvidia |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlases can consist of uniformly-sized sub-images, or they can consist of images of varying dimensions.&lt;ref name="nvidia" /&gt; A sub-image is drawn using custom [[texture coordinates]] to pick it out of the atlas. In an application where many small [[texture (computer graphics)|textures]] are used frequently, it is often more efficient to store the textures in a texture atlas which is treated as a single unit by the [[Graphics processing unit|graphics hardware]].  Storing textures in an atlas reduces the overhead of a context switch by increasing [[memory locality]]. Careful alignment may be needed to avoid bleeding between sub textures when used with [[mipmapping]] and [[texture compression]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">A '''train-and-equip program''' is a military operation in which one country provides [[Military education and training|training]] and [[Military technology|equipment]] to an [[Allies|ally]]. The practice typically involves the transfer of expertise and materiel from a stronger military to a weaker one, as an alternative to fighting together outright. The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has run several train-and-equip programs in recent [[military history]].
__NOTOC__
==Bosnia==
During the [[Bosnian War]], American president [[Bill Clinton]] and Bosnian president [[Alija Izetbegović]] agreed to a train-and-equip program for Bosnia, valued at an estimated $500 million [[United States Dollar|USD]]. American diplomat [[James W. Pardew]] oversaw the implementation of the plan. The Bosnian Train and Equip Program was carried out in a multi-agency effort over the course of two years and led to a reduction of military tensions between warring factions in the country and removed foreign extremist influence from the political process.It is widely considered a success in securing the peace in Bosnia and allowing the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] partners to responsibly extract themselves from the conflict. &lt;ref&gt;The Bosnian Train and Equip Program: A Lesson in Interagency Integration of Hard and Soft Power

'''''Traité de mécanique céleste''''' ({{lang-en|"Treatise of celestial mechanics"}}) is a five-volume [[treatise]] on [[celestial mechanics]] written by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and published from 1798 to 1825 with a second edition in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traité de mécanique céleste, ''1798–1825''|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100242426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oeuvres de Laplace|location=Paris|publisher=Imprimerie royale|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008629833|postscript=; 1843–1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laplace, Pierre Simon, marquis de|location=Paris|title=Traité de mécanique céleste, ''1799–1825''|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100900122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laplace, Pierre Simon, marquis de|title=Traité de mécanique céleste|edition=deuxième|year=1829|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012304177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, the government of Louis Philippe gave a grant of 40,000 francs for a 7-volume national edition of the ''Oeuvres de Laplace'' (1843–1847); the ''Traité de mécanique céleste'' with its four supplements occupies the first 5 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|author=Clerke, Agnes Mary|authorlink=Agnes Mary Clerke|wstitle=Laplace, Pierre Simon|volume=16|pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Newton laid the foundations of Celestial Mechanics, at the close of the seventeenth century, by the discovery of the principle of universal gravitation. Even in his own hands, this discovery led to important consequences, but it has required a century and a half, and a regular succession of intellects the most powerful, to fill up the outline sketched by him. Of these, Laplace himself was the last, and, perhaps after Newton, the greatest; and the task commenced in the ''Principia'' of the former, is completed in the ''Mécanique Celéste'' of the latter. In this last named work, the illustrious author has proposed to himself his object, to unite all the theories scattered throughout the various channels of publication, employed by his predecessors, to reduce them to one common method, and present them all in the same point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: ''Traité de Mécanique Céleste'' par M. Le Marquis de Laplace, Tome V.

{{blockquote|If one were asked to name the two most important works in the progress of mathematics and physics, the answer would undoubtedly be, the ''Principia'' of Newton and the ''Mécanique Céleste'' of Laplace. In their historical and philosophical aspects these works easily outrank all others, and furnish thus the standard by which all others must be measured. The distinguishing feature of the ''Principia'' is its clear and exhaustive enunciation of fundamental principles. The ''Mécanique Céleste'', on the other hand, is conspicuous for the development of principles and for the profound generality of its methods. The ''Principia'' gives the plans and specifications of the foundations; the ''Mécanique Céleste'' affords the key to the vast and complex superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woodward, R.

==Bowditch's translation==
The famous American mathematician [[Nathaniel Bowditch]] translated the first four volumes of the ''Traité de mécanique céleste'' but not the fifth volume;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillispie, Charles Coulston|author2=Grattan-Guinness, Ivor|title=Pierre-Simon Laplace, 1749-1827: a life in exact science|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2000|page=283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iohJomX0IWgC&amp;pg=PA283}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Bowditch did make use of relevant portions of the fifth volume in his extensive commentaries for the first four volumes.&lt;ref name=MacTbio&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Bowditch|title=Nathaniel Bowditch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The first four volumes of Dr. Bowditch's Translation and Commentary were published successively, in 1828, 1832, 1834, and 1839, at the sacrifice of one quarter of his whole property. The expense was largely increased by the voluminous commentary. This was really of the nature of an original work, and was rendered necessary by the frequent gaps which Laplace had left in his own publication. Mr. N. I. Bowditch says, in his biography of his father, that Dr. Bowditch was accustomed to remark, "Whenever I meet in Laplace with the words, ''Thus it plainly appears'', I am sure that hours, and perhaps days, of hard study will alone enable me to discover ''how'' it plainly appears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The "Mécanique Céleste" of Laplace, and Its Translation, with a Commentary by Bowditch|author=Lovering, Joseph|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume= 24, |date=May 1888 – May 1889|pages=185–201|doi=10.2307/20021561|jstor=20021561|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050585932;view=1up;seq=197}} (See p. 196 for quote.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{blockquote|Bowditch's translation of the first four volumes of Laplace's ''Traité de mécanique céleste'' was completed by 1818 but he would not publish it for many years. Almost certainly the cost of publication caused the delay, but Bowditch did not just put the work on one side after 1818 but continued to improve it over the succeeding years. Bowditch was helped by [[Benjamin Peirce]] in this project and his commentaries doubled the length of the book. His purpose was more than just an English translation. He wanted to supply steps omitted in the original text; to incorporate later results into the translation; and to give credits omitted by Laplace.&lt;ref name=MacTbio/&gt;}}

It was jointly owned and operated by [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]] and [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] universities and used for performing [[neutron activation]] work and training [[reactor operator]]s.&lt;ref name=UofM&gt;

== Design ==
The reactor used highly [[enriched uranium]] metal fuel clad in aluminium. The fuel elements consisted of bundles of flat plates rather than rods. The core was cooled by light water.

The fuel elements were situated within six open-topped aluminium tanks containing water that were separated and surrounded by graphite. This meant that moderation was part by the water within the tanks and part by graphite - with graphite serving as the reflector.

Reactivity control was provided by four semaphore signal–type control blades held by magnetic clutches to shafts that could be driven by geared electric motors. The blades were made of cadmium plates rivetted to aluminium blades. The insertion of a single blade was sufficient to shut down the fission chain reaction.

The simple control system did not use voting logic. Any detected fault resulted in an immediate scram. Power failure also produced an immediate scram as the magnetic clutches on the control blades would disengage, certain control instrumentation had battery back up support.

The heat generated by fission was carried away by the cooling water and disposed of outside the facility by means of a forced-draft cooling radiator. Due to the small size of the core and low burn up of the fuel, the disposal of fission product heating was not an issue.

The concrete shielding was penetrated by a number of holes enabling neutron beams to be obtained for the purpose of irradiating samples and several pipes that enabled samples in sample carriers to be inserted into the reactor and subsequently removed to the adjoining radiochemical laboratory for study.

== Operations ==
The construction works started in 1962 and went critical on 7 July 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Razey|first=M.|date=1964|title=The Universities Research Reactor|url=https://www.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1049%2Fep.1964.0359|journal=Electronics and Power|volume=10|issue=10|pages=372|doi=10.1049/ep.1964.0359|issn=0013-5127}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In later years the reactor was rated at 300&amp;nbsp;kW thermal however originally the output was 100&amp;nbsp;kW thermal.

A study was undertaken (around 1980) to investigate increasing the power to 1 MW thermal; however, this was deemed to be too difficult and the plans were abandoned.

== Decommissioning ==
Decommissioning work began in 1992 and was finished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E.|first=HUMPHREYS|last2=K.|first2=RIDING|date=1994|title=Stages 1&amp;2 Decommissioning of the Universities Research Reactor(URR), Risley|url=|journal=Nuclear Engineer|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=154-157|issn=0262-5091|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor fuel been [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]].

==Animal vivisection==
[[File:Animal lab.JPG|thumb|An anesthetized pig used for training a surgeon]]

Research requiring vivisection techniques that cannot be met through other means is often subject to an external [[ethics]] review in conception and implementation, and in many jurisdictions use of [[anesthesia]] is legally mandated for any surgery likely to cause [[pain]] to any [[vertebrate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309053773 National Academy of Sciences Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States of America|U.S.]], the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] explicitly requires that any procedure that may cause pain use "tranquilizers, analgesics, and anesthetics",&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|7|2145|a|3|c|ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; with exceptions when "scientifically necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|7|2145|a|3|c|v}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act does not define "scientific necessity" or regulate specific scientific procedures,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/awa/awa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but approval or rejection of individual techniques in each federally funded lab is determined on a case-by-case basis by the [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]], which contains at least one veterinarian, one scientist, one non-scientist, and one other individual from outside the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iacuc.org The Official IACUC Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], any experiment involving vivisection must be licensed by the [[Home Secretary]]. The [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]] "expressly directs that, in determining whether to grant a licence for an experimental project, 'the Secretary of State shall weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue.{{'"}}

In [[Australia]], the Code of Practice "requires that all experiments must be approved by an Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee" that includes a "person with an interest in animal welfare who is not employed by the institution conducting the experiment, and an additional independent person not involved in animal experimentation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Singer|Singer, Peter]]. ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]].'' Avon: New York, 1990, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-vivisectionists have played roles in the emergence of the [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] movements, arguing that animals and humans have the same [[natural rights]] as living creatures, and that it is inherently immoral to inflict pain or injury on another living creature, regardless of the purpose or potential benefit to mankind.&lt;ref name=Yarri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carroll, Lewis|authorlink=Lewis Carroll|title=Some popular fallacies about vivisection|journal=[[The Fortnightly Review]]|date=June 1875|volume=17|pages=847–854|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cQRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vivisection and anti-vivisection in the 19th century ===
At the turn of the 19th century, medicine was undergoing a transformation. The emergence of hospitals and the development of more advanced medical tools such as the stethoscope are but a few of the changes in the medical field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco|first=Nuno Henrique|date=2013-03-19|title=Animal Experiments in Biomedical Research: A Historical Perspective|journal=Animals|volume=3|issue=1|pages=238–273|doi=10.3390/ani3010238|issn=2076-2615|pmc=4495509|pmid=26487317}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an increased recognition that medical practices needed to be improved, as many of the current therapeutics were based on unproven, traditional theories that may or may not have helped the patient recover. The demand for more effective treatment shifted emphasis to research with the goal of understanding disease mechanisms and anatomy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This shift had a few effects, one of which was the rise in patient experimentation, leading to some moral questions about what was acceptable in clinical trials and what was not. An easy solution to the moral problem was to use animals in vivisection experiments, so as not to endanger human patients. This, however, had its own set of moral obstacles, leading to the anti-vivisection movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== François Magendie (1783–1855) ====
One polarizing figure in the anti-vivisection movement was [[François Magendie]]. Magendie was a physiologist at the Académie Royale de Médecine in France, established in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Magendie made several groundbreaking medical discoveries, but was far more aggressive than some of his other contemporaries with his use of animal experimentation. For example, the discovery of the different functionalities of dorsal and ventral spinal nerve roots was achieved by both Magendie, as well as a Scottish anatomist named Charles Bell. Bell used an unconscious rabbit because of "the protracted cruelty of the dissection", which caused him to miss that the dorsal roots were also responsible for sensory information. Magendie, on the other hand, used conscious, six-week-old puppies for his own experiments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brebisnoire.wordpress.com/a-history-of-antivivisection-from-the-1800s-to-the-present-part-i-mid-1800s-to-1914/|title=A History of Antivivisection from the 1800s to the Present: Part I (mid-1800s to 1914)|date=2009-06-10|work=the black ewe|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Magendie's approach was more of an infringement on what we would today call animal rights, both Bell and Magendie used the same justification for vivisection: the cost of animal lives and experimentation was well worth it for the benefit of humanity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many viewed Magendie's work as cruel and unnecessarily torturous. One note is that Magendie carried out many of his experiments before the advent of anesthesia, but even after ether's discovery it was not used in any of his experiments or classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Even during the period before anesthesia, other physiologists expressed their disgust with how he conducted his work. One such visiting American physiologist describes the animals as "victims" and the apparent sadism that Magendie displayed when teaching his classes. The cruelty in such experiments actually even led to Magendie's role as an important figure in animal rights legislation. He was so despised in Britain that his experiments were cited in the drafting of the [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822]] and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== David Ferrier and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 ====
[[File:Frog vivisection.jpg|thumb|Prior to vivisection for educational purposes, [[chloroform]] was administered as an [[anesthetic]] to this [[Common Sand Frog|common sand frog]].]]
The [[Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876]] in Britain determined that one could only conduct vivisection on animals with the appropriate license from the state, and that the work the physiologist was doing had to be original and absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finn|first=Michael A.|last2=Stark|first2=James F.|date=2015-02-01|title=Medical science and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876: A re-examination of anti-vivisectionism in provincial Britain|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848614001575|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=49|pages=12–23|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was set for such legislation by physiologist [[David Ferrier]]. Ferrier was a pioneer in understanding the brain and used animals to show that certain locales of the brain corresponded to bodily movement elsewhere in the body in 1873. He put these animals to sleep, and caused them to move unconsciously with a probe. Ferrier was successful, but many decried his use of animals in his experiments. Some of these arguments came from a religious standpoint. Some were concerned that Ferrier's experiments would separate God from the mind of man in the name of science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the anti-vivisection movement in England had its roots in Evangelicalism and Quakerism. These religions already had a distrust for science, only intensified by the recent publishing of Darwin's Theory of Evolution in 1859.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Neither side was pleased with how the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 was passed. The scientific community felt as though the government was restricting their ability to compete with the quickly advancing France and Germany with new regulations. The anti-vivisection movement was also unhappy, but because they believed that it was a concession to scientists for allowing vivisection to continue at all.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ferrier would continue to vex the anti-vivisection movement in Britain with his experiments when he had a debate with his German opponent, Friedrich Goltz. They would effectively enter the vivisection arena, with Ferrier presenting a monkey, and Goltz presenting a dog, both of which had already been operated on. Ferrier won the debate, but did not have a license, leading the anti-vivisection movement to sue him in 1881. Ferrier was not found guilty, as his assistant was the one operating, and his assistant did have a license.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ferrier and his practices gained public support, leaving the anti-vivisection movement scrambling. They made the moral argument that given recent developments, scientists would venture into more extreme practices to operating on "the cripple, the mute, the idiot, the convict, the pauper, to enhance the “interest” of [the physiologist's] experiments".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Human vivisection==
It is possible that human vivisection was practiced by some Greek anatomists in Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] in ''De Medicina'' and the early-Christian writer [[Tertullian]] state that [[Herophilos]] of Alexandria vivisected at least 600 live prisoners.&lt;ref name="galen1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyK2oKiLDTAC Galen. On Semen. DeLacy P (trans.) Akademie Verlag, 1992. p.147 l.22]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unit 731]], a [[biological warfare|biological]] and [[chemical warfare]] research and development unit of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], undertook lethal [[Human subject research|human experimentation]] during the period that comprised both the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and the [[Second World War]] (1937–1945). In [[Mindanao]], [[Moro people|Moro Muslim]] prisoners of war were subjected to various forms of vivisection by the Japanese, in many cases without anesthesia.&lt;ref name = dissect&gt;{{cite news |title=Dissect them alive: order not to be disobeyed |author=Richard Lloyd Parry |publisher=Times Online |date=February 25, 2007 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1438491.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = unmasking&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D71630F934A25750C0A963958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print "Unmasking Horror"] Nicholas D. Kristof (March 17, 1995) New York Times. A special report.; Japan Confronting Gruesome War Atrocity&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death by a thousand cuts]] was a form of [[torture murder|torture and execution]] used by [[Imperial China]] from roughly 900 CE until it was banned in 1905.

[[File:voltage clamp.svg|thumb|277px|right|The '''voltage clamp''' operates by [[negative feedback]]. The membrane potential [[differential amplifier|amplifier]] measures membrane voltage and sends output to the feedback amplifier; this subtracts the membrane voltage from the command voltage, which it receives from the signal generator.

{{Portal|Neuroscience}}
The '''voltage clamp''' is an experimental method used by [[electrophysiology|electrophysiologists]] to measure the [[ion]] [[electrical current|currents]] through the [[cell membrane|membranes]] of excitable cells, such as [[neuron]]s, while holding the membrane [[voltage]] at a set level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_137-2|title=Encyclopedia of Computational Neuroscience|last=Nowotny|first=Dr Thomas|last2=Levi|first2=Dr Rafael|date=2014|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461473206|editor-last=Jaeger|editor-first=Dieter|pages=1–5|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_137-2|editor-last2=Jung|editor-first2=Ranu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic voltage clamp will iteratively measure the [[membrane potential]], and then change the membrane potential (voltage) to a desired value by adding the necessary current. This "clamps" the cell membrane at a desired constant voltage, allowing the voltage clamp to record what currents are delivered. Because the currents applied to the cell must be equal to (and opposite in [[electric charge|charge]] to) the current going across the cell membrane at the set voltage, the recorded currents indicate how the cell reacts to changes in membrane potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernandez-Ochoa | first1 = E.

==History==

The concept of the voltage clamp is attributed to [[Kenneth Cole (electrophysiologist)|Kenneth Cole]]&lt;ref name=Neuroscience&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bear |editor1-first=Mark F. |editor2-last=Connors |editor2-first=Barry W. |editor3-last=Michael A. |title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain |origyear=1996 |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, Baltimore |isbn=978-0-7817-6003-4 |id={{LCC|QP355.2.B42}} |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Marmont]]&lt;ref name="duke"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://neuron.duke.edu/userman/2/pioneer.html |chapter=A Brief history of Computational Neuroscience |publisher=Duke University |first1=John W. |last1=Moore |first2=Michael L. |last2=Hines |year=1994 |title=Simulations with NEURON}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring of 1947.&lt;ref name="Andrew Huxley 1996"&gt;Andrew Huxley, 1996, "Kenneth Sterward Cole 1900 – 1984, A biographical Memoir" National Academy of Sciences. (Washington D.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; They inserted an internal electrode into the giant axon of a squid and began to apply a current. Cole discovered that it was possible to use two [[electrode]]s and a [[feedback circuit]] to keep the [[cell (biology)|cell's]] [[membrane potential]] at a level set by the experimenter.

Cole developed the voltage clamp technique before the era of [[microelectrode]]s, so his two electrodes consisted of fine wires twisted around an [[electrical insulation|insulating]] rod. Because this type of electrode could be inserted into only the largest cells, early electrophysiological experiments were conducted almost exclusively on [[squid]] axons.

[[File:Authorized Kenneth Cole Picture.jpg|thumb|middle|A personal photo of Kenneth Cole, given to Dr. J. Walter Woodbury]]

Squids squirt jets of water when they need to move quickly, as when escaping a predator. To make this escape as fast as possible, they have an [[axon]] that can reach 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter (signals propagate more quickly down large axons). The [[squid giant axon]] was the first preparation that could be used to voltage clamp a transmembrane current, and it was the basis of Hodgkin and Huxley's pioneering experiments on the properties of the action potential.&lt;ref name="Andrew Huxley 1996"/&gt;

[[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Alan Hodgkin]] realized that, to understand ion flux across the membrane, it was necessary to eliminate differences in membrane potential.&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02280-4 |title=From overshoot to voltage clamp |year=2002 |last1=Huxley |first1=Andrew |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=553–8 |pmid=12392929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using experiments with the voltage clamp, Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]] published 5 papers in the summer of 1952 describing how ionic currents give rise to the [[action potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Vandenberg, J. I. and S. G. Waxman (2012). "Hodgkin and Huxley and the basis for electrical signalling: a remarkable legacy still going strong." J. Physiol. (Oxford, U. K.) 590(11): 2569–2570.&lt;/ref&gt; The final paper proposed the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] which mathematically describes the action potential. The use of voltage clamps in their experiments to study and model the action potential in detail has laid the foundation for [[electrophysiology]]; for which they shared the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt;

==Technique==
The voltage clamp is a current generator. [[Transmembrane voltage]] is recorded through a "voltage electrode", relative to [[electrical ground|ground]], and a "current electrode" passes current into the cell. The experimenter sets a "holding voltage", or "command potential", and the voltage clamp uses negative feedback to maintain the cell at this voltage. The electrodes are connected to an amplifier, which measures membrane potential and feeds the signal into a [[feedback amplifier]]. This amplifier also gets an input from the signal generator that determines the command potential, and it subtracts the membrane potential from the command potential (V&lt;sub&gt;command&lt;/sub&gt; – V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), magnifies any difference, and sends an output to the current electrode. Whenever the cell deviates from the holding voltage, the [[operational amplifier]] generates an "error signal", that is the difference between the command potential and the actual voltage of the cell. The [[feedback circuit]] passes current into the cell to reduce the error signal to zero. Thus, the clamp circuit produces a current equal and opposite to the ionic current.

==Variations of the voltage clamp technique==

=== Two-electrode voltage clamp using microelectrodes ===
[[File:tevcimage.jpg|thumb|Two-electrode voltage clamp]]
The two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique is used to study properties of membrane proteins, especially ion channels.&lt;ref name=Guan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-351-0_6 |title=Two-electrode voltage clamp |year=2013 |last1=Guan |first1=B. |last2=Chen |first2=X. |last3=Zhang |first3=H. |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=998 |pages=79–89 |pmid=23529422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers use this method most commonly to investigate membrane structures expressed  in [[Xenopus laevis|''Xenopus'']] [[oocyte]]s. The large size of these oocytes allows for easy handling and manipulability.&lt;ref name=Polder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0270(01)00385-5 |title=The use of control theory for the design of voltage clamp systems: a simple and standardized procedure for evaluating system parameters |year=2001 |last1=Polder |first1=H.R. |last2=Swandulla |first2=D. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=97–109 |pmid=11513944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TEVC method utilizes two low-resistance pipettes, one sensing voltage and the other injecting current. The microelectrodes are filled with conductive solution and inserted into the cell to artificially control membrane potential. The membrane acts as a [[dielectric]] as well as a [[resistor]], while the fluids on either side of the membrane function as [[capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Polder/&gt; The microelectrodes compare the membrane potential against a command voltage, giving an accurate reproduction of the currents flowing across the membrane. Current readings can be used to analyze the electrical response of the cell to different applications.

This technique is favored over single-microelectrode clamp or other voltage clamp techniques when conditions call for resolving large currents. The high current-passing capacity of the two-electrode clamp makes it possible to clamp large currents that are impossible to control with single-electrode [[patch clamp|patch techniques]].&lt;ref name=DiFranco&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1085/jgp.201010496 |title=Chloride currents from the transverse tubular system in adult mammalian skeletal muscle fibers |year=2011 |last1=DiFranco |first1=M. |last2=Herrera |first2=A. |last3=Vergara |first3=J.L. |journal=The Journal of General Physiology |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=21–41 |pmid=21149546 |pmc=3010054}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-electrode system is also desirable for its fast clamp settling time and low noise. However, TEVC is limited in use with regard to cell size. It is effective in larger-diameter oocytes, but more difficult to use with small cells. Additionally, TEVC method is limited in that the transmitter of current must be contained in the pipette. It is not possible to manipulate the intracellular fluid while clamping, which is possible using patch clamp techniques.&lt;ref name=Hernandez-Ochoa&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.01.001 |title=Voltage clamp methods for the study of membrane currents and SR Ca(2+) release in adult skeletal muscle fibres |year=2012 |last1=Hernandez-Ochoa |first1=E. |last2=Schneider |first2=M. |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=98–118 |pmid=22306655 |pmc=3321118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage involves "space clamp" issues. [[Kenneth Cole (electrophysiologist)|Cole's]] voltage clamp used a long wire that clamped the squid axon uniformly along its entire length. TEVC microelectrodes can provide only a spatial [[point source]] of current that may not uniformly affect all parts of an irregularly shaped cell.

==== Dual-cell voltage clamp ====
The dual-cell voltage clamp technique is a specialized variation of the two electrode voltage clamp, and is only used in the study of [[gap junction]] channels.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9560458 |year=1998 |last1=Van Rijen |first1=H. V. M. |last2=Wilders |first2=Ronald |last3=Van Ginneken |first3=Antoni C. G. |last4=Jongsma |first4=Habo J. |title=Quantitative analysis of dual whole-cell voltage-clamp determination of gap junctional conductance |volume=436 |issue=1 |pages=141–51 |journal=Pflügers Archiv |doi=10.1007/s004240050615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gap junctions are pores that directly link two cells through which ions and small metabolites flow freely. When two cells in which gap junction proteins are expressed either endogenously or via injection of [[mRNA]], a junction channel will form between the cells. Since two cells are present in the system, two sets of electrodes are used. A recording electrode and a current injecting electrode are inserted into each cell, and each cell is clamped individually (each set of electrodes is attached to a separate apparatus, and integration of data is performed by computer). To record junctional [[electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]], the current is varied in the first cell while the recording electrode in the second cell records any changes in V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for the second cell only. (The process can be reversed with the stimulus occurring in the second cell and recording occurring in the first cell.) Since no variation in current is being induced by the electrode in the recorded cell, any change in voltage must be induced by current crossing into the recorded cell, through the gap junction channels, from the cell in which the current was varied.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

=== Single-electrode voltage clamp ===
This category describes a set of techniques in which one electrode is used for voltage clamp. Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c) technique is often used with patch-clamp recording. Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) technique is used with penetrating intracellular recording. This single electrode carries out the functions of both current injection and voltage recording.

==== Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c) ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
{{Main|patch clamp}}
The "patch-clamp" technique allows the study of individual ion channels. It uses an electrode with a relatively large tip (&gt; 1 micrometer) that has a smooth surface (rather than a sharp tip). This is a "patch-clamp electrode" (as distinct from a "sharp electrode" used to impale cells). This electrode is pressed against a cell membrane and suction is applied to pull the cell's membrane inside the electrode tip. The suction causes the cell to form a tight seal with the electrode (a "gigaohm seal", as the resistance is more than a [[ohm (unit)|gigaohm]]).

SEV-c has the advantage that you can record from small cells that would be impossible to impale with two electrodes. However:
#Microelectrodes are imperfect conductors; in general, they have a resistance of more than a million [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]. They rectify (i.e., change their resistance with voltage, often in an irregular manner), they sometimes have unstable resistance if clogged by cell contents. Thus, they will not faithfully record the voltage of the cell, especially when it is changing quickly, nor will they faithfully pass current.
#Voltage and current errors: SEV-c circuitry does not actually measure the voltage of the cell being clamped (as does a two-electrode clamp). The patch-clamp amplifier is like a two-electrode clamp, except the voltage measuring and current passing circuits are connected (in the two-electrode clamp, they are connected ''through the cell''). The electrode is attached to a wire that contacts the current/voltage loop inside the amplifier. Thus, the electrode has only an indirect influence on the feedback circuit. The amplifier reads only the voltage at the top of the electrode, and feeds back current to compensate. But, if the electrode is an imperfect conductor, the clamp circuity has only a distorted view of the membrane potential. Likewise, when the circuit passes back current to compensate for that (distorted) voltage, the current will be distorted by the electrode before it reaches the cell. To compensate for this, the electrophysiologist uses the lowest resistance electrode possible, makes sure that the electrode characteristics do not change during an experiment (so the errors will be constant), and avoids recording currents with kinetics likely to be too fast for the clamp to follow accurately. The accuracy of SEV-c goes up the slower and smaller are the voltage changes it is trying to clamp.
#Series resistance errors: The currents passed to the cell must go to ground to complete the circuit. The voltages are recorded by the amplifier relative to ground. When a cell is clamped at its natural [[resting potential]], there is no problem; the clamp is not passing current and the voltage is being generated only by the cell. But, when clamping at a different potential, series resistance errors become a concern; the cell will pass current across its membrane in an attempt to return to its natural resting potential. The clamp amplifier opposes this by passing current to maintain the holding potential. A problem arises because the electrode is between the amplifier and the cell; i.e., the electrode is ''in series'' with the resistor that is the cell's membrane. Thus, when passing current through the electrode and the cell, [[Ohm's Law]] tells us that this will cause a voltage to form across both the cell's and the electrode's resistance. As these resistors are in series, the voltage drops will add. If the electrode and the cell membrane have equal resistances (which they usually do not), and if the experimenter command a 40mV change from the resting potential, the amplifier will pass enough current until it reads that it has achieved that 40mV change. However, in this example, half of that voltage drop is across the electrode. The experimenter thinks he or she has moved the cell voltage by 40 mV, but has moved it only by 20 mV. The difference is the "series resistance error". Modern patch-clamp amplifiers have circuity to compensate for this error, but these compensate only 70-80% of it. The electrophysiologist can further reduce the error by recording at or near the cell's natural resting potential, and by using as low a resistance electrode as possible.
#Capacitance errors. Microelectrodes are capacitors, and are particularly troublesome because they are non-linear. The capacitance arises because the electrolyte inside the electrode is separated by an insulator (glass) from the solution outside. This is, by definition and function, a capacitor. Worse, as the thickness of the glass changes the farther you get from the tip, the [[time constant]] of the capacitor will vary. This produces a distorted record of membrane voltage or current whenever they are changing. Amplifiers can compensate for this, but not entirely because the capacitance has many time-constants. The experimenter can reduce the problem by keeping the cell's bathing solution shallow (exposing less glass surface to liquid) and by coating the electrode with silicone, resin, paint, or another substance that will increase the distance between the inside and outside solutions.
#Space clamp errors. A single electrode is a point source of current. In distant parts of the cell, the current passed through the electrode will be less influential than at nearby parts of the cell. This is particularly a problem when recording from neurons with elaborate dendritic structures. There is nothing one can do about space clamp errors except to temper the conclusions of the experiment.

==== Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) ====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
A single-electrode voltage clamp &amp;mdash; discontinuous, or SEVC-d, has some advantages over SEVC-c for whole-cell recording. In this, a different approach is taken for passing current and recording voltage. A SEVC-d amplifier operates on a "[[time-sharing]]" basis, so the electrode regularly and frequently switches between passing current and measuring voltage. In effect, there are two electrodes, but each is in operation for only half of the time it is on. The oscillation between the two functions of the single electrode is termed a duty cycle. During each cycle, the amplifier measures the membrane potential and compares it with the holding potential. An [[operational amplifier]] measures the difference, and generates an error signal. This current is a mirror image of the current generated by the cell. The amplifier outputs feature [[sample and hold]] circuits, so each briefly sampled voltage is then held on the output until the next measurement in the next cycle. To be specific, the amplifier measures voltage in the first few microseconds of the cycle, generates the error signal, and spends the rest of the cycle passing current to reduce that error. At the start of the next cycle, voltage is measured again, a new error signal generated, current passed etc. The experimenter sets the cycle length, and it is possible to sample with periods as low as about 15 microseconds, corresponding to a 67&amp;nbsp;kHz switching frequency. Switching frequencies lower than about 10&amp;nbsp;kHz are not sufficient when working with action potentials that are less than 1 millisecond wide. Note that not all discontinuous voltage-clamp amplifier support switching frequencies higher than 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Polder2001&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0270(01)00385-5 |title=The use of control theory for the design of voltage clamp systems: a simple and standardized procedure for evaluating system parameters |year=2001 |last1=Polder |first1=H. R. |last2=Swandulla |first2=D. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=97–109 |pmid=11513944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this to work, the cell capacitance must be higher than the electrode capacitance by at least an [[order of magnitude]]. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much less than that of the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the electrode voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle.

SEVC-d has a major advantage over SEVC-c in allowing the experimenter to measure membrane potential, and, as it obviates passing current and measuring voltage at the same time, there is never a series resistance error. The main disadvantages are that the time resolution is limited and the amplifier is unstable. If it passes too much current, so that the goal voltage is over-shot, it reverses the polarity of the current in the next duty cycle. This causes it to undershoot the target voltage, so the next cycle reverses the polarity of the injected current again. This error can grow with each cycle until the amplifier oscillates out of control (“ringing”); this usually results in the destruction of the cell being recorded. The investigator wants a short duty cycle to improve temporal resolution; the amplifier has adjustable compensators that will make the electrode voltage decay faster, but, if these are set too high the amplifier will ring, so the investigator is always trying to “tune” the amplifier as close to the edge of uncontrolled oscillation as possible, in which case small changes in recording conditions can cause ringing. There are two solutions: to “back off” the amplifier settings into a safe range, or to be alert for signs that the amplifier is about to ring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4707">'''The MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College''' is the oldest [[Low-residency program|low-residency]] [[creative writing]] [[Master of Fine Arts]] program in the United States.  Prior to the founding of this program, an MFA in creative writing was earned via standard residential graduate programs that required students to be in residence at an academic institution for the majority of the academic year.

Students in the program earn an MFA degree in creative writing over 4-8 semesters. The low-residency model at Warren Wilson requires attendance twice a year (January and July) for ten days of lectures, classes, workshops and readings by both faculty and students.  Students are paired with a faculty member who directs the creative and [[criticism|critical]] work for the student over the following semester.  This model of short residencies followed by a semester of one-on-one work with a faculty member has been that adopted by most low-residency MFA programs.

==History==
The Warren Wilson MFA program was founded in 1976 by [[Ellen Bryant Voigt]] at [[Goddard College]]. In 1981, Goddard College became fiscally unstable and the program moved to [[Warren Wilson College]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina]].

The program's faculty and alumni have won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the [[National Book Award]], as well as fellowships from the [[MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].  The alumni of the program have published hundreds of books and won many awards.  The program is currently directed by [[Debra Allbery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~mfa/newwebsite/prospectivestudents.php MFA Program website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/880 Academy of American Poets Page for Ellen Bryant Voigt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2007_p_voigt.html National Book Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==
The Warren Wilson MFA program faculty change, thus giving students exposure to many writers. Recent faculty of the program include: [[Betty Adcock]], [[Andrea Barrett]], [[Charles Baxter (author)|Charles Baxter]], Marianne Boruch, Robert Boswell, [[Gabrielle Calvocoressi]], [[Lan Samantha Chang]], [[Michael Collier (poet)|Michael Collier]], [[Stephen Dobyns]], [[Jennifer Grotz]], Brooks Haxton, David Haynes, [[Tony Hoagland]], C.J. Hribal, [[A. Van Jordan]], Victor LaValle, [[Thomas Mallon]], [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]], [[Heather McHugh]], [[Martha Rhodes]], [[Danzy Senna]], [[David Shields]], [[Megan Staffel]], [[Daniel Tobin]], [[Kirstin Valdez Quade]], [[Ellen Bryant Voigt]], [[C. Dale Young]], [[Dean Young (poet)|Dean Young]], and others. The list of the faculty over the entire 30-year history of the program numbers above 150 writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~mfa/newwebsite/facultypastandpresent.php Complete List of Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of Study==

All semesters in the Program begin and end with a 10-day residency.  Students completing the program without break will attend five residencies and complete four semesters.  The residencies include lectures, classes, workshops, and seminars.  Some students opt to do one or more extra semesters, and some opt to take a semester off at times.

* Semester 1: Students generate new writing under supervision of their Faculty Adviser, revise work, write 12-15 annotations (examining a work from the perspective of single element of craft), and read 20 books related to their genre.
* Semester 2: Students generate new writing under supervision of their Faculty Adviser, revise work, write 12-15 annotations (examining a work from the perspective of single element of craft), and read 20 books related to their genre, as well as beginning to formulate the topic for their Degree Essay.
* Semester 3: Students write a 30-50 page degree essay examining one or more works with regard to elements of craft, which is required in order to advance toward graduation.
*Semester 4: Students generate a thesis of work of publishable quality be writing new poetry or fiction as well as revising work previously generated in the program, write 12-15 annotations, read 20 or more books toward their bibliography, and prepare a Class to be given at their final residency.

'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] to ensure the information is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]] for future researchers, historians, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|url = http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1214&amp;doi=10.4338/ACI-2013-07-RA-0055|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH – Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated capture due to the massive size and amount of information on the Web.  The largest web archiving organization based on a bulk crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web. 

The International Web Archiving Workshop (IWAW), begun in 2001, has provided a platform to share experiences and exchange ideas. The later founding of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium|International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)]], in 2003, has greatly facilitated international collaboration in developing standards and open source tools for the creation of web archives. These developments, and the growing portion of human culture created and recorded on the web, combine to make it inevitable that more and more libraries and archives will have to face the challenges of web archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:25658314|title=Truman, Gail. 2016. Web Archiving Environmental Scan. Harvard Library Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. 

Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Provenance and development==

Early practice of web archiving involved the highlighting of a "site of the week award" as a record for the contest. Besides that, another early practice was the professional link list (for example [[Amnesty International]]'s list of human rights groups) and ([https://www.yahoo.com Yahoo!]) directory and Open Directory Project.

In the mid-1990s, one of the more important listing sites of its kind continually updated an index of worthwhile website destinations organized by content category.

In 1998, Yahoo directory was considered to have made a significant contribution to emerging online library science, not only by its classification scheme but also by the means of the content "navigation" it developed.

Soliciting, evaluating, and categorizing websites – the large-scale collecting, hand-sorting, and display of websites – could be considered an original form of website analysis. The rise of the algorithmic search engine has largely led to the disappearance of such manual methods.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive various types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
{{see also|List of Web archiving initiatives}}

===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically access web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remote harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include:
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

There exist various free services which may be used to archive web resources "on-demand", using web crawling techniques. These services include the [[Wayback Machine]] and [[WebCite]].

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202744/http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams.

==Difficulties and limitations==

===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form can lie in the Deep Web if crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e., a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology.

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1-1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.

Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman&lt;ref&gt;Lyman (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in some countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|title=Legal Deposit {{!}} IIPC|website=netpreserve.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316103200/http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|archivedate=2017-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]], the [[Internet Archive]] or the [[Internet Memory Foundation]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/faq |title=WebCite FAQ |work=Webcitation.org |author= |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:

* Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
* Collecting verifiable Web assets
* Providing Web asset search and retrieval
* Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [[Heritrix]] – collecting Web asset
* [[NutchWAX]] – search Web archive collections
* [[Open source Wayback Machine]] – search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [[International Internet Preservation Consortium#Web Curator Tool|Web Curator Tool]] – Selection and Management of Web Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |title=Web Curator Tool |publisher=Webcurator.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104051655/http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [[WARC Tools]] – for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, [[Web ARChive|WARC]] archives programmatically
* Google Search Tools – for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Free but not open source tools also exist:

==Load transfer==
In wheeled [[vehicle]]s, '''load transfer''' is the measurable change of [[Structural load|load]] borne by different wheels during [[acceleration]] (both longitudinal and lateral).&lt;ref name=Pacejka/&gt; This includes [[Brake|braking]], and deceleration (which is an acceleration at a negative rate).&lt;ref name=Jazar&gt;{{cite book

No motion of the center of mass relative to the wheels is necessary, and so load transfer may be experienced by vehicles with no suspension at all. Load transfer is a crucial concept in understanding [[vehicle dynamics]]. The same is true in bikes, though only longitudinally.&lt;ref name=Cossalter/&gt;

==Cause==
The major [[force]]s that accelerate a vehicle occur at the [[tire]]s' [[contact patch]]es.  Since these forces are not directed through the vehicle's CoM, one or more [[Moment (physics)|moments]] are generated whose forces are the tires' traction forces at pavement level, the other one (equal but opposed) is the mass inertia located at the CoM and the moment arm is the distance from pavement surface to CoM. It is these moments that cause variation in the load distributed between the tires.  Often this is interpreted by the casual [[observation|observer]] as a pitching or rolling motion of the vehicles body.  A perfectly rigid vehicle without suspension that would not exhibit pitching or rolling of the body still undergoes load transfer. However, the pitching and rolling of the body of a non-rigid vehicle adds some (small) [[#Weight transfer|weight transfer]] due to the (small) CoM horizontal displacement with respect to the wheel's axis suspension vertical travel and also due to deformation of the tires i.e. contact patch displacement relative to wheel.

Lowering the CoM towards the ground is one method of reducing load transfer.  As a result load transfer is reduced in both the longitudinal and lateral directions.  Another method of reducing load transfer is by increasing the wheel spacings. Increasing the vehicle's [[wheelbase]] (length) reduces longitudinal load transfer while increasing the vehicle's [[Axle track|track]] (width) reduces lateral load transfer. Most high performance automobiles are designed to sit as low as possible and usually have an extended wheelbase and track.

One way to calculate the effect of load transfer, keeping in mind that this article uses "load transfer" to mean the phenomenon commonly referred to as "weight transfer" in the automotive world, is with the so-called "weight transfer equation":

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta Weight_{front} = a\frac{h}{b}m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta Weight_{front} = \frac{a}{g} \frac{h}{b}w&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta Weight_{front}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in load borne by the front wheels, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the longitudinal acceleration, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]], &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass height, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the wheelbase, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the total vehicle mass, and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the total vehicle weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Weight transfer involves the ''actual'' (relatively small) movement of the vehicle CoM relative to the wheel axes due to displacement of the [[chassis]] as the suspension complies, or of cargo or liquids within the vehicle, which results in a redistribution of the total vehicle load between the individual tires.

==Center of mass==
Weight transfer occurs as the vehicle's CoM shifts during automotive maneuvers.  Acceleration causes the [[sprung mass]] to rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM. Front-back weight transfer is proportional to the change in the longitudinal location of the CoM to the vehicle's wheelbase, and side-to-side weight transfer (summed over front and rear) is proportional to the ratio of the change in the CoM's lateral location to the vehicle's track.

Liquids, such as fuel, readily flow within their containers, causing changes in the vehicle's CoM. As fuel is consumed, not only does the position of the CoM change, but the total weight of the vehicle is also reduced.

By way of example, when a vehicle accelerates, a weight transfer toward the rear wheels can occur. An outside [[observation|observer]] might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or [[Suspension (vehicle)#Anti-dive and anti-squat|squats]]. Conversely, under braking, weight transfer toward the front of the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the nose [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake dive|dives]] toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), weight transfer to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.

'''Weight transfer''' is generally of far less practical importance than [[load transfer]], for cars and SUVs at least. For instance in a 0.9g turn, a car with a track of 1650&amp;nbsp;mm and a CoM height of 550&amp;nbsp;mm will see a load transfer of 30% of the vehicle weight, that is the outer wheels will see 60% more load than before, and the inners 60% less. Total available grip will drop by around 6% as a result of this load transfer. At the same time, the CoM of the vehicle will typically move laterally and vertically, relative to the [[contact patch]] by no more than 30&amp;nbsp;mm, leading to a weight transfer of less than 2%, and a corresponding reduction in grip of 0.01%.

==Traction==
Load transfer causes the available [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at all four wheels to vary as the car brakes, accelerates, or turns. This bias to one pair of tires doing more "work" than the other pair results in a net loss of total available traction.  The net loss can be attributed to the phenomenon known as [[tire load sensitivity]].

An exception is during positive acceleration when the engine power is driving two or fewer wheels.  In this situation where all the tires are not being utilized load transfer can be advantageous.  As such, the most powerful cars are almost never [[front wheel drive]], as the acceleration itself causes the front wheels' traction to decrease. This is why sports cars usually have either [[rear wheel drive]] or [[all wheel drive]] (and in the all wheel drive case, the power tends to be biased toward the rear wheels under normal conditions).

==Rollover==
If (lateral) load transfer reaches the tire loading on one end of a vehicle, the inside wheel on that end will lift, causing a change in handling characteristic.  If it reaches half the weight of the vehicle it will start to roll over.  Some large trucks will roll over before skidding, while passenger vehicles and small trucks usually roll over only when they leave the road.  Fitting racing tires to a tall or narrow vehicle and then driving it hard may lead to rollover.
