'''''A Dream of the Past: Sir Isumbras at the Ford''''' (1857) is a painting by [[John Everett Millais]] depicting a medieval knight helping two young peasant children over a swollen river. The children are carrying heavy burdens of wood for winter fuel. Though the title refers to the medieval poem ''[[Sir Isumbras]]'', the painting does not illustrate a scene from the original text. However Millais's friend, the writer [[Tom Taylor]], wrote verse in a pastiche of the original poem, describing the event depicted. This was included in the original exhibition catalogue.

The background of the painting is based closely on a ruined medieval bridge which stood in [[Bridge of Earn]], [[Perthshire]] (since demolished).  Some of the village houses (in Back Street) can also be seen, though the tower house or castle to the left is imaginary.

When first exhibited the painting was extremely controversial, and was attacked by many critics. Most notably, Millais's former supporter [[John Ruskin]] declared it to be a "catastrophe". The painting was also satirised in a print by [[Frederic Sandys]], entitled "A Nightmare", in which Millais himself was represented as the knight. His fellow Pre-Raphaelites [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[William Holman Hunt]] were caricatured as the children, and the horse—transformed into a donkey—was branded with the initials of Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/edwards3.html Victorian Web: Sir Isumbras at the Ford]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
The original poem describes an arrogant knight who is humbled by misfortune in his youth, a story derived from the [[Book of Job]] and the legend of [[Saint Eustace]]. The subject depicted by Millais portrays the elderly, now humble, Isumbras after the events narrated in the poem. It was described by [[Frederic George Stephens]] as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Sir Isumbras at the Ford' was the subject of the picture Millais made his leading work in the year 1857. It represented an ancient knight, all clad in golden armour, who had gone through the glories of this life – war honour, victory and reward, wealth and pride. Though he is aged and worn with war, his eye is still bright with the glory of human life, and yet he has stooped his magnificent pride so far as to help, true knight as he was, two little children, and carries them over a river ford upon the saddle of his grand war-horse, woodcutter's children as they were. The face of this warrior was one of those pictorial victories which can derive their success from nothing less than inspiration. The sun was setting beyond the forest that gathered about the river's margin, and, in its glorious decadence, symbolised the nearly spent life of the warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Millais, J.G, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, vol I, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theme of the [[chivalry|Christian Chivalry]] was a topical one at the time, discussed by Ruskin himself and other authors such as [[Charles Kingsley]], who saw it as a means to overcome class division. It is comparable to the hymn [[Good King Wenceslas]], written in the same decade, which also describes an aristocrat helping peasants who have been gathering fuel. Millais was also probably influenced by [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s print, [[:Image:Duerer - Ritter, Tod und Teufel (Der Reuther).jpg|The Knight, Death and the Devil]].

==Controversy==
[[File:The Nightmare - Frederick Sandys.jpg|thumb|300px|right| ''A Nightmare'' by Frederic Sandys, satirising the painting. Rossetti is caricatured as the child on the left and Holman Hunt as the child on the right. Millais is the knight]] Critical commentary on the painting when it was first exhibited was largely hostile, with many critics finding the horse over-large and ugly and the expressions of the children exaggerated. Ruskin (whose wife [[Effie Gray|Effie]] had left him for Millais a few years previously) was extremely savage, condemning the picture for making errors in "pictorial grammar" by portraying the foreground as lighter than the "more exposed" hills in the background. He insisted that Millais had suffered "not just a fall—but catastrophe".

In response, Millais attempted to repaint parts of the picture before he sent it to another exhibition in Liverpool. The repainted version won a prize at the Liverpool exhibition. Millais altered the picture again in the 1880s, adding decoration to the reins and bridle.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Influence==
Despite its early bad reception, the painting became quite influential, inspiring a number of other images of chivalric knights. It was also taken up by political caricaturists, who took their cue from Sandys's caricature to replace the figures with politicians of the day, suggesting alliances between mismatched forces in attempts to "carry over" some piece of legislation. This tradition continued well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Codell, Julie F.

Some of [[John Tenniel]]'s work for the ''Alice'' stories of [[Lewis Carroll]] has been sourced to paintings: "[[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|The White Knight]] echoes Millais's ''Sir Isumbras at the Ford''.

'''''Akua'ba''''' are wooden ritual [[fertility]] [[doll]]s from [[Ghana]] and nearby areas. The best known ''akua'ba'' are those of the [[Ashanti people]], whose ''akua'ba'' have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region (f.ex. [[Lobi people]]) have their own distinctive style of ''akua'ba''.

Traditionally, these dolls are carried on the back of women either hoping to [[pregnancy|conceive a child]], or to ensure the attractiveness of the child being carried. When not in active use, the ''akua'ba'' would be ritually washed and cared for.

Today, one is more likely to see a [[mass production|mass-produced]] ''akua'ba'' for sale as a souvenir than an heirloom in ritual use. Traditional use does, however, continue in some areas. The form of the ''akua'ba'' has also gained currency as a general symbol of good [[luck]].

'''Albert Henri Victor Cleuter''' (10 August 1901 [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]] - 1996) was a Belgian botanical artist. He was the only child of Francois Ernest Cleuter and Henriette Marie Catherine Denys of Brussels. The father loved to draw and produced ink and watercolour sketches admired by his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3668130|title=Albert Cleuter (1901-1996), dessinateur botaniste|first=A.|last=Lawalrée|date=1 January 1997|journal=Bulletin du Jardin Botanique National de Belgique / Bulletin van de National Plantentuin van België|volume=66|issue=1/2|pages=3–11|via=|doi=10.2307/3668130|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert enrolled at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels in August 1917 where he successfully completed a year of design study and 4 years of architecture and related courses, and two years of ornamental composition. He also produced sketches and designs for ladies' fashion.

At the Botanical Garden of Belgium he succeeded [http://www.br.fgov.be/PUBLIC/GENERAL/HISTORY/durandhelene.php Hélène Durand], a prolific illustrator of conifers. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.br.fgov.be/PUBLIC/GENERAL/EVENTS/EVENTSNL/Persbericht%20Plantenportretten.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A master at developing his own style, Albert Cleuter, was active as botanical illustrator at the ''[[Jardin Botanique National de Belgique]]'' from 1936 to 1966, his style becoming an accepted standard there. An architect by training, he discovered a new vocation in botanical illustration and produced hundreds of plates, proving himself to be a great observer, and creating virtuoso work with his pen. He occasionally used the time-consuming stipple technique for shading when he felt that a line drawing was not adequate. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/-titre-expo-5-bonnes-raisons-de-voir-l-expo-portraits-d_t-20090107-00L0WY.html|title=Partners - lesoir.be|first=|last=lesoir.be|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war years he worked as illustrator for the underground paper ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' and forged identity documents for fugitives such as downed pilots. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.randkrant.be/files/rand-krant/2008/randkrant-12-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleuter illustrated works for W Robyns: "Flore du Congo Belge et Ruanda-Urundi" 1948+; André Lawalrée: "Flore gén Belgique" 1950-9; J Fouarge/J Louis: "Essences forestières d'Afrique"; F White: "Forest Flora N Rhodesia" 1962. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi2/index.php?table_name=dsi&amp;page=0&amp;function=search&amp;execute_search=1|title=DSI - Database of Scientific Illustrators|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monthly journal '''''az-Zuhūr''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الزهور; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: az-Zuhūr; [[English language|english]]: "Flowers") was published in [[Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. az-Zuhūr, 1910–1913.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1910 until 1913. Altogether, 40 issues exist. The editor Anṭūn al-Ǧumayyil (1887-1948) did already participate in the publication of the [[Beirut|Beirutian]] newspaper ''al-Bašīr'' (1870-1947) and the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram|al-Ahrām]]'' (1875-today).&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Glaß (2004): ''Der al-Muqtaṭaf und seine Öffentlichkeit. Aufklärung, Räsonnement und Meinungsstreit in der frühen arabischen Zeitschriftenkommunikation'', 2 Bde., Würzburg, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature and art were the main focus whereat the journal mainly tried to support young authors and to improve the relationship between arab writers from different regions.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kendall (2006): ''Literature, Journalism and the Avant-Garde: Intersection in Egypt'', New York, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition ''az-Zuhūr'' wanted to keep the balance between European and contemporary Arabic literature like some other later popular journals.

Beside literary criticism, book reviews and news about the literary life in [[Egypt]], the authors stand up for the establishment and enhancement of the egyptian theatre. ''Az-Zuhūr'' was the first journal to publish in its series a play of [[Shakespeare]], [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]. Until the cut-off in 1913 the journal organized numerous writing competitions which helped to achieve more popularity.&lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth Kendall (2006): ''Literature, Journalism and the Avant-Garde: Intersection in Egypt'', New York, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''az-Zuhūr'' was able to add a significant contribution to the Egyptian literary life.

'''Barbara Jeppe''' (21 May 1921 [[Pilgrim's Rest, Mpumalanga|Pilgrim's Rest]] – 20 June 1999 [[Johannesburg]]) was a South African [[botanical illustrator|botanical artist]].
Born in the mining town of [[Pilgrim's Rest, Mpumalanga|Pilgrim's Rest]], she was the daughter of Victor Brereton, a land-surveyor, and Gladys Evans. At an early age her mother introduced her to the world of wild flowers.

She was married to Carl Louis Jeppe, a psychiatrist. The couple had four children, Leigh, Marie, Carl and David. Twenty years into her marriage, she illustrated her first book, ''Trees and Shrubs of the Witwatersrand'' (Witwatersrand University Press) with which she made her mark in the field of botanical art.

Over a period of three years she spent a year in the Cape, illustrating and writing the text for her book on Cape bulbs. This passion for bulbs resulted in the publication of the ''Spring and Winter Flowering Bulbs of the Western Cape'' (Oxford University Press). Her definitive work on ''[[Amaryllidaceae]]'' in collaboration with Piet Vorster, has yet to be published, the illustrations being finished by her daughter, Leigh Voigt.

Besides her botanical paintings, Barbara Jeppe had a great love for butterflies and painted many for friends and family. She also occasionally ventured into painting landscapes.

She was awarded two gold medals in 1990, one by the Botanical Society of South Africa, the [[Cythna Letty]] Gold medal for contributions to botanical illustrations in South Africa, and another by the South African Nurserymen’s Association. The Transvaal Horticultural Society bestowed on her a silver medal in 1991.

She died at the age of 78 in Johannesburg from complications after contracting pneumonia.&lt;ref name="abcjourn-549493"&gt;{{cite web|title=|trans-title=|periodical=abcjournal.org|publisher=|url=https://abcjournal.org/index.php/ABC/article/viewFile/549/493|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-10-19|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past century the Indonesian art of [[batik]]-making has become firmly established in [[Sri Lanka]]. The '''[https://www.lanka.com/about/interests/sri-lankan-batik/ Batik industry in Sri Lanka]''' is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and creativity. Its economic benefit is profit from dealing with foreign customers. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along [[Hikkaduwa]]'s Galle Road strip. [[Mahawewa]], on the other hand, is famous for its batik factories.

Batiks incorporate many [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s and colours, some traditional, others highly contemporary and individual. Many display a vigorousness of design related to their origin. The material created by the batik-makers is used to produce distinctive dresses, shirts, sarongs and beachwear well-suited for tropical climes. Many tourists at seaside resorts such as Hikkaduwa wear batik clothes throughout their holiday. Apart from [[Clothing|clothes]], [[tablecloth]]s, wall pictures, beach clothes, pure cotton and silk, men's and ladies' wear and bed covers are popular as a reminder of a visit to Sri Lanka.

Batiks originated many centuries ago with the villagers and tribesmen of what are now the countries of [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] and has been [[History of Sri Lanka|brought to Sri Lanka]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The promotion of the village arts is a way of keeping alive an important part of a vibrant and beautiful culture. Many of Sri Lanka's batik paintings are imported directly from [[Java]]nese village artists. They use 100-percent cotton cloth and all dyes used are colour-fast.

The batik art panels provide quilters, craft and home sewers, and interior designers with an opportunity to combine an ancient art form with a contemporary use. Since each batik piece is individually handmade, the colours and designs may vary. Originally, when batik-making was a cottage industry, one artist created the entire batik from start to finish.

The '''Berlin Gold Hat''' or '''Berlin Golden Hat''' ([[German language|German:]] ''Berliner Goldhut'') is a Late [[Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] made of thin gold leaf. It served as the external covering on a long conical brimmed headdress, probably of an organic material.  It is now in the [[Neues Museum]] on [[Museum Island]] in Berlin, in a room by itself with an elaborate explanatory display.

The Berlin Gold Hat is the best preserved specimen among the four known conical [[Golden hats]] known from Bronze Age [[Europe]] so far. Of the three others, two were found in southern [[Germany]], and one in the west of [[France]]. All were found in the 19th and 20th centuries.  It is generally assumed that the hats served as the insignia of [[deities]] or [[priests]] in the context of a sun cult that appears to have been widespread in Central Europe at the time.&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;''Gold und Kult der Bronzezeit''. (Ausstellungskatalog). Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nürnberg 2003. {{ISBN|3-926982-95-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The hats are also suggested to have served astronomical/calendrical functions.

The Berlin Gold Hat was acquired in 1996 by the [[Berlin]] [[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte]] as a single find without [[provenance]]. A comparative study of the ornaments and techniques in conjunction with dateable finds suggests that it was made in the Late Bronze Age, ''circa'' 1,000 to 800 BC.

== Description ==
The Berlin gold hat is a 490 g gold hat with a long  and slender conical shaft and a differentiated convex foot, decorated all over with [[Tracing (art)|traced]] motifs, applied with small stamps and wheels. Its composition is very similar to the previously known [[Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch]].

At the bottom of the cone, the sheet gold of the Berlin hat is reinforced by a 10&amp;nbsp;mm wide ring of sheet [[bronze]]. The external edge of the brim is strengthened by a twisted square-sectioned wire, around which the gold leaf is turned upwards.

The overall height is 745&amp;nbsp;mm. The hat was hammered from a gold [[alloy]] of 87.7% [[Gold|Au]], 9.8% [[Silver|Ag]], 0.4% [[Copper|Cu]] and 0.1% [[Tin|Sn]]. It was made of a single piece; its average thickness is 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm. 
The cone is ornamented with 21 zones of horizontal bands and rows of symbols along all of its length. Fourteen different stamps and three decorated wheels or cylindrical-stamps were used. The horizontal bands were decorated systematically with repeated similar patterns.

The individual ornamental bands were optically separated traced ribs and bulges, mostly achieved with the use of cylindrical stamps. The bands of ornaments contain mostly buckle and circle motifs, most with a circular central buckle surrounded by up to six concentric circles.

One of the bands is distinctive: It is decorated with a row of recumbent crescents, each atop an almond- or eye-shaped symbol. The point of the cone is embellished with an eight-spoke star on a background of decorative punches.

An overview of the type and number of stamps used in the ornamental zones is shown on the right.

The meeting of the shaft with the foot is taken up by a wide vertically ribbed band. The foot is decorated with similar motifs to the cone itself. Near the reinforcing bronze band, it turns into a brim, also decorated with disk-shaped symbols.

[[File:Berlin Gold hat calendar.jpg|thumb|Calendrical function of the Berlin Gold Hat]]

Modern scholarship has demonstrated that the ornamentation of the gold leaf cones of the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt type]], to which the Berlin example belongs, represent systematic sequences in terms of number and types of ornaments per band.  A detailed study of the Berlin example, which is the only fully preserved one, showed that the symbols probably represent a [[lunisolar]] calendar. The object would have permitted the determination of dates or periods in both [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s.&lt;ref name="L1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L2"&gt;Wilfried Menghin (Hrsg.): ''Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica.'' Unze, Potsdam 32.2000, S. 31-108. {{ISSN|0341-1184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions discovered so far would permit the counting of temporal units of up 57&amp;nbsp;months. A simple multiplication of such values would also permit the calculation of longer periods, such as [[metonic cycle]]s. 
Each symbol, or each ring of a symbol, represents a single day. Apart from ornament bands incorporating differing numbers of rings there are special symbols and zones in [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] areas, which would have had to be added to or subtracted from the periods in question.

The system of this mathematical function incorporated into the artistic ornamentation has not been fully deciphered so far, but a schematic understanding of the Berlin Golden Hat and the periods it delimits has been achieved.

In principle, starting with zone &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt;, a sum is achieved by adding a relevant contiguous number of neighbouring sections: &lt;math&gt;Z_i\, ...\, Z_{i+n}&lt;/math&gt;. To reach the equivalent lunar or solar value, from this initial sum must be subtracted the sum of symbols from the intercalary zone(s) within the area counted.

The illustration depicts the solar representation on the left and the lunar one on the right. The red or blue fields in Zones&amp;nbsp;5, 7, 16, and 17 are [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] zones.

The values in the individual fields are reached by multiplying the number of symbols per zone with the number of rings or circles incorporated in each predominant symbol. The special symbols in Zone&amp;nbsp;5 are assigned the value of 38, as indicated by their number.

;Example
:''Zone&amp;nbsp;12 is dominated by 20&amp;nbsp;repetitions of punched symbol No.&amp;nbsp;14, a circular disc symbol surrounded by 5&amp;nbsp;concentric circles.''
:''Thus, the symbol has the value of 20&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100.''
:''The smaller ring symbols placed between the larger repetitions of No.&amp;nbsp;14 are considered as mere ornaments and thus not counted.''

Through this system, the Hats can be used to calculate a lunisolar calendrical system, i.e. a direct reading in either lunar or solar dates, as well as the conversion between them.

The table can be used in the same way as the original Golden Hats. To determine the number of days in a specific time period (yellow fields), the values of the coloured fields above are added, reaching an intermediate sum. If any of the red intercalary zones are included, their sum has to be subtracted. This allows the calculation of 12, 24, 36, 48, 54, and 57&amp;nbsp;[[synodic month]]s in the lunar system and of 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, and 57&amp;nbsp;solar months (twelfths of a tropical year).

;Example
:''To determine a 54&amp;nbsp;month cycle in the lunar system, the numerical values of the green or blue Zones&amp;nbsp;3 to 21 are added, reaching a sum of 1,739&amp;nbsp;days. From this, the values of the red intercalary fields&amp;nbsp;5, 16, and 17 are subtracted, The result is 1739&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;142&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1597&amp;nbsp;days, exactly 54&amp;nbsp;synodic months of 29.5305&amp;nbsp;days each.''

The overall discrepancy of 2&amp;nbsp;days to the astronomically accurate value is probably the result of a slight imprecision in the Bronze Age observation of synodic and solar month.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Provenance and find history ==
[[File:Goldhut detail.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Berlin Gold Hat, Detail]]

The Berlin Gold Hat was put on sale in the international arts trade in 1995. In 1996, the Berlin Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte bought it as an important Bronze Age artefact. The seller claimed that the object came from an anonymous [[Switzerland|Swiss]] private collection which had been assembled in the 1950s and 1960s. It assumed that the Hat was found in [[Southern Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. No further details are known. The good preservation of the cone suggests that, like the Schifferstadt example, it must have been carefully filled with soil or ashes and then buried upright in relatively fine soil.

== Manufacture ==
The Berlin Gold Hat is made of a gold [[alloy]] of 87.7% [[Gold|Au]], 9.8% [[Silver|Ag]], 0.4% [[Copper|Cu]] and 0.1% [[Tin|Sn]]. It is hammered seamlessly from a single piece. The amount of gold used would form a cube of only 3&amp;nbsp;cm dimensions. The average thickness is 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm.

Because of the [[tribology|tribological]] characteristics of the material, it tends to harden with increasing deformation (see [[ductility]]), increasing its potential to crack. To avoid cracking, an extremely even deformation was necessary. Additionally, the material had to be softened by repeatedly heating it to a temperature of at least 750 °C.

Since gold alloy has a relatively low [[melting point]] of ''circa'' 960 °C, a very careful [[temperature control]] and an [[isothermal process|isothermal heating process]] were required, so as to avoid melting any of the surface. For this, the Bronze Age artisans used a charcoal fire or oven similar to those used for [[pottery]]. The temperature could only be controlled through the addition of [[oxygen]], using a [[bellows]].

Considering the tribologic conditions and the technical means available at the time, the production even of an undecorated Golden hat would represent an immense technical achievement.

In the course of its further manufacture, the Berlin Hat was embellished with rows of radial ornamental bands, [[Chasing|chased]] into the metal. To make this possible, it were probably filled with a [[putty]] or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] based on [[resin|tree resin]] and [[wax]] - in the Schifferstadt specimen, traces of this survived. The thin gold leaf was structured by chasing: stamp-like tools or moulds depicting the individual symbols were repeatedly pressed into (or rolled along) the exterior of the gold. At least 17 separate tools (17 stamps and 3 cylindrical stamps) were used.

&lt;!-- first para - Science and optics--&gt;
'''Blue''' is one of the three [[primary color|primary colours]] of pigments in painting and traditional [[colour theory]], as well as in the [[RGB color model|RGB colour model]]. It lies between [[Violet (color)|violet]] and [[green]] on the [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of [[visible light]]. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a [[dominant wavelength]] between approximately 450 and 495 [[nanometre]]s.  Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; [[Azure (color)|azure]] contains some green, while [[ultramarine]] contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as [[Rayleigh scattering#Cause of the blue color of the sky|Rayleigh scattering]].  An optical effect called [[Tyndall scattering]] explains [[blue eyes]]. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called [[atmospheric perspective]].

&lt;!-- second para - history --&gt;
Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone [[lapis lazuli]] was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in [[the Renaissance]], to make the pigment [[ultramarine]], the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used [[cobalt blue]] to colour fine [[blue and white porcelain]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], European artists used it in the windows of [[Cathedrals]].  Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye [[woad]] until it was replaced by the finer [[indigo]] from America.  In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and synthetic dyes.  Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits.  Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- third para - symbolism and associations--&gt;Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sometimes with sadness.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}} In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=22}} The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}}

==Shades and variations==
{{Main article|Shades of blue}}
[[File:Linear visible spectrum.svg|center|400px|Blue is between violet and green in the spectrum of visible light]]
Blue is the colour of light between violet and green on the [[visible spectrum]]. Hues of blue include indigo and [[ultramarine]], closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; [[Cyan]], which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[teal]], and [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]].

Blue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white.  Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, [[cobalt blue]], [[navy blue]], and [[Prussian blue]]; while lighter tints include [[sky blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], and [[Egyptian blue]]. (For a more complete list see the [[List of colors|List of colours]]).

Blue pigments were originally made from minerals such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[cobalt]] and [[azurite]], and blue dyes were made from plants; usually [[woad]] in Europe, and ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'', or true indigo, in Asia and Africa. Today most blue pigments and dyes are made by a chemical process.

==Etymology and linguistic differences==
The [[modern English]] word ''blue'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''bleu'' or ''blewe'', from the [[Old French]] ''bleu'', a word of [[Germanic language|Germanic]] origin, related to the [[Old High German]] word ''blao''.&lt;ref name="Webster 1970"&gt;''Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary'', (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In heraldry, the word [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] is used for blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|date=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=978-0-906670-44-6|pages=40, 343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue (голубой, goluboy) and dark blue (синий, siniy). See [[Color term|Colour term]].

Several languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], and [[Lakota Sioux]], use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is ''xanh''. In Japanese, the word for blue (青 ao) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning "go". (For more on this subject, see [[Distinguishing blue from green in language]])

Linguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/211213-sky-isnt-blue|title=Why Isn't the Sky Blue?|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Radiolab]] at WNYC Studios|access-date=2018-04-27|others=with [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]]|location=New York|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colour names often developed individually in natural languages, typically beginning with [[black]] and [[white]] (or dark and light), and then adding [[red]], and only much later – usually as the last main category of color accepted in a language – adding the colour blue, probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Human eyes perceive blue when observing light which has a [[dominant wavelength]] of roughly 450–495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.

Isaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description the [[visible spectrum]],  He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum.  He included [[indigo]], the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Hardy and Fred H. Perrin. ''The Principles of Optics.'' McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York. 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting and traditional [[colour theory]], blue is one of the three [[primary color|primary colours]] of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide [[gamut]] of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey. From the Renaissance onwards, painters used this system to create their colours. (See [[RYB]] colour system.)

The RYB model was used for [[colour printing]] by [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]] as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta, cyan, yellow and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.

In the 19th century the Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] found a new way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called [[additive colour]] or the [[RGB colour model]], is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white.

On the [[HSL and HSV|HSV colour wheel]], the [[Complementary color|complement]] of blue is [[yellow]]; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of [[red]] and [[green]] light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory ([[RYB color model|RYB]]) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be [[orange (colour)|orange]] (based on the [[Munsell color system|Munsell colour wheel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |title=Glossary Term: Color wheel |website=Sanford-artedventures.com |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907184837/http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigments and dyes===
Blue [[pigments]] were made from minerals, especially [[lapis lazuli]] and [[azurite]] ({{chem|Cu|3|(CO|3|)|2|(OH)|2|)}}.  These minerals were crushed, ground into powder, and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent, such as egg yolk ([[tempera painting]]); or with a slow-drying oil, such as [[linseed oil]], for [[oil painting]]. To make blue [[stained glass]], [[cobalt blue]] (cobalt(II) aluminate: {{chem|CoAl|2|O|4}})pigment was mixed with the glass. Other common blue pigments made from minerals are [[ultramarine]] ({{chem|Na&lt;sub&gt;8-10&lt;/sub&gt;||Al|6|Si|6|O|24|S&lt;sub&gt;2-4&lt;/sub&gt;}}), [[cerulean blue]] (primarily cobalt (II) stanate: {{chem|Co|2|SnO|4}}), and [[Prussian blue]] (milori blue: primarily {{chem|Fe|7|(CN)|18}}).

[[Natural dyes]] to colour cloth and tapestries were made from plants. [[Woad]] and [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] were used to produce [[indigo dye]] used to colour fabrics blue or [[indigo]]. Since the 18th century, natural blue dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic dyes.

{{anchor|Reflex Blue}}	
"Reflex blue" used to be the name of a common blue pigment in ink manufacturing. 	
In the 1960s, the name was adopted into the proprietary [[Pantone Matching System]] (PMS) to refer to this specific pigment. Pantone "Reflex Blue" has the particularity of being identified only by this name, and not by a number code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pantone.com/help/?t=Origin-of-%27reflex-blue%27-name  Origin of 'reflex blue' name (pantone.com)] [https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/Reflex-Blue-C Pantone Reflex Blue C (pantone.com) [https://www.mitostudios.com/what-is-the-pms-number-of-reflex-blue/ What is the PMS Number of “Reflex Blue”?

===Why the sky and sea appear blue===
Of the colours in the visible spectrum of light, blue has a very short wavelength, while red has the longest wavelength. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called [[Rayleigh scattering]], after [[Lord Rayleigh]], the British physicist who discovered it. It was confirmed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html|title=Why is the sky Blue?|website=ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102085211/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html|archivedate=2015-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near sunrise and sunset, most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, the colour red is more perceptible than any of the other colours.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.patarnott.com/atms749/pdf/blueSkyHumanResponse.pdf Human color vision and the unsaturated blue color of the daytime sky] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050855/http://www.patarnott.com/atms749/pdf/blueSkyHumanResponse.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}", Glenn S. Smith, ''American Journal of Physics'', Volume 73, Issue 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;590–597 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason: the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue, which comes to the eye of the viewer. The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky, reflected by particles in the water; and by [[algae]] and plant life in the water, which can make it look green; or by sediment, which can make it look brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/waterchemistry/f/why-is-the-ocean-blue.htm|title=Why Is the Ocean Blue?|author=Anne Marie Helmenstine|website=About.com Education|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118203351/http://chemistry.about.com/od/waterchemistry/f/why-is-the-ocean-blue.htm|archivedate=2012-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric perspective===
The farther away an object is, the more blue it often appears to the eye. For example, mountains in the distance often appear blue. This is the effect of [[atmospheric perspective]]; the farther an object is away from the viewer, the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour, which is usually blue. In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue, green and red, the blue will appear to be more distant, and the red closer to the viewer.  The cooler a colour is, the more distant it seems.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la coulour'' (2009), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

File:LightningVolt Deep Blue Sea.jpg|Under the sea, red and other light with longer wavelengths is absorbed, so white objects appear blue. The deeper you go, the darker the blue becomes. In the open sea, only about one per cent of light penetrates to a depth of 200 metres. (See [[underwater]] and [[euphotic depth]])
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===Astronomy===
[[Blue giant]]s are hot and luminous [[star]]s with surface temperatures exceeding 10,000&amp;nbsp;K. The largest [[blue supergiant star]]s are extremely massive and energetic, and are usually unstable. They are generally short-lived, either exploding in a [[supernova]] or periodically shedding their outer layers to become [[red giant]]s.

===Blue eyes===
[[File:Blue eye Stephen.png|thumb|Blue eyes actually contain no blue pigment. The colour is caused by an effect called [[Rayleigh scattering]], which also makes the sky appear blue.]]
Blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment.

==History==

===In the ancient world===
[[File:Ebih-Il Louvre AO17551 n11.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the blue, lapis lazuli inlays used for the irises in the ''[[Statue of Ebih-Il]]'', dating to the twenty-fifth century BC, discovered in the temple of [[Inanna|Ishtar]] at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]]]

Blue was a latecomer among colours used in art and decoration, as well as language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, M., &amp; Cruse, M. I. (2001). Blue: The history of a color p. 64. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in [[cave paintings]] from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments.&lt;ref&gt;See Michel Pastoureau, ''Blue: Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – [[woad]] in Europe, [[indigo]] in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either [[lapis lazuli]] or [[azurite]].

Lapis lazuli, a semi-precious stone, has been mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years, and was exported to all parts of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorey|first=Peter Roger|title=Ancient mesopotamian materials and industries: the archaeological evidence|year=1999|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-042-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Lapis+lazuli+++mines+in+the+Badakhshan#v=onepage&amp;q=Lapis%20lazuli%20%20%20mines%20in%20the%20Badakhshan&amp;f=false|pages=86–87|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003232804/https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Lapis+lazuli+++mines+in+the+Badakhshan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sW6_TvWKBIKr8AOTn623BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lapis%20lazuli%20%20%20mines%20in%20the%20Badakhshan&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran and Mesopotamia, it was used to make jewellery and vessels. In Egypt, it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of [[King Tutankhamun]] (1341–1323 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Bongioanni &amp; Maria Croce (ed.), ''The Treasures of Ancient Egypt: From the Egyptian Museum in Cairo'', Universe Publishing, a division of Ruzzoli Publications Inc., 2003. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Importing lapis lazuli by caravan across the desert from Afghanistan to Egypt was very expensive. Beginning in about 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as [[Egyptian blue]] by grinding [[silica]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[copper]], and [[alkalai]], and heating it to {{convert|800|or| 900|C}}. This is considered the first synthetic pigment.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase, W.T. 1971, "Egyptian blue as a pigment and ceramic material." In: R. Brill (ed.) ''Science and Archaeology''. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-02061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian blue was used to paint wood, papyrus and canvas, and was used to colour a glaze to make [[faience]] beads, inlays, and pots. It was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings. Blue was considered a beneficial colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife. Blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were wrapped.&lt;ref&gt;J. Baines, "Color Terminology and Color Classification in Ancient Egyptian Color Terminology and Polychromy", in ''The American Anthropologist'', volume LXXXVII, 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;282–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity. The Egyptian god [[Amun]] could make his skin blue so that he could fly, invisible, across the sky. Blue could also protect against evil; many people around the Mediterranean still wear a blue amulet, representing the eye of God, to protect them from misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Blue glass was manufactured in [[Mesopotamia]] and Egypt as early as 2500 BC, using the same copper ingredients as Egyptian blue pigment. They also added cobalt, which produced a deeper blue, the same blue produced in the Middle Ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of Saint-Denis and Chartres.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ishtar Gate]] of ancient [[Babylon]] (604–562 BC) was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as a background for pictures of lions, dragons and [[aurochs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F.R.|last=Matson|title=Compositional Studies of the Glazed Brick from the Ishtar Gate at Babylon|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts. The Research Laboratory|year=1985|isbn=978-0-87846-255-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks classified colours by whether they were light or dark, rather than by their hue. The Greek word for dark blue, ''kyaneos'', could also mean dark green, violet, black or brown. The ancient Greek word for a light blue, ''glaukos'', also could mean light green, grey, or yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastourou, ''Bleu: Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon. They used Egyptian blue in the wall paintings of [[Knossos]], in Crete, (2100 BC). It was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by [[Pliny the Elder]] (red, yellow, black, and white), but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on Greek temples and to colour the beards of Greek statues.&lt;ref name="Ball106"&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans also imported indigo dye, but blue was the colour of working class clothing; the nobles and rich wore white, black, red or violet. Blue was considered the colour of mourning, and the colour of barbarians. Julius Caesar reported that the Celts and Germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their hair blue when they grew old.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''The Gallic Wars'', V., 14, 2. Cited by Miche Pastourou, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Romans made extensive use of blue for decoration. According to [[Vitruvius]], they made dark blue pigment from indigo, and imported Egyptian blue pigment. The walls of Roman villas in [[Pompeii]] had frescoes of brilliant blue skies, and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants.&lt;ref name="Ball106"/&gt; The Romans had many different words for varieties of blue, including ''caeruleus'', ''caesius'', ''glaucus'', ''cyaneus'', ''lividus'', ''venetus'', ''aerius'', and ''ferreus'', but two words, both of foreign origin, became the most enduring; ''blavus'', from the Germanic word ''blau'', which eventually became ''bleu'' or blue; and ''azureus'', from the Arabic word ''lazaward'', which became azure.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu: Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic World===
Dark blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire. In Byzantine art Christ and the Virgin Mary usually wore dark blue or purple. Blue was used as a background colour representing the sky in the magnificent mosaics which decorated Byzantine churches.&lt;ref&gt;L. Brehier, ''Les mosaiques a fond d'azur'', in ''Etudes byzantines'', volume III, Paris, 1945. pp. 46ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic world, blue was of secondary importance to green, believed to be the favourite colour of the [[Prophet Mohammed]].  At certain times in [[Moorish Spain]] and other parts of the Islamic world, blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews, because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, Couleurs – Pigments et teintures dans les mains des peoples, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Dark blue and turquoise decorative tiles were widely used to decorate the facades and interiors of mosques and palaces from Spain to Central Asia.  Lapis lazuli pigment was also used to create the rich blues in [[Persian miniatures]].

===During the Middle Ages===
In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. The nobility wore red or purple, while only the poor wore blue clothing, coloured with poor-quality dyes made from the [[woad]] plant. Blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the [[Abbe Suger]] rebuilt the [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. He installed [[stained glass]] windows coloured with [[cobalt]], which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the "bleu de Saint-Denis". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]], and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing. In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black, grey, violet, dark green or dark blue. In the 12th century the Roma Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia; [[ultramarine]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Blue became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.

Ultramarine was made from lapis lazuli, from the mines of [[Badakshan]], in the mountains of Afghanistan, near the source of the [[Oxus]] River. The mines were visited by Marco Polo in about 1271; he reported, "here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues." Ground lapis was used in Byzantine manuscripts as early as the 6th century, but it was impure and varied greatly in colour. Ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process, creating a rich and deep blue. It was called ''bleu outremer'' in French and ''blu oltremare'' in Italian, since it came from the other side of the sea. It cost far more than any other colour, and it became the luxury colour for the Kings and Princes of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour''. p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Louis IX of France]], better known as Saint Louis (1214–1270), became the first king of France to regularly dress in blue. This was copied by other nobles.  Paintings of the mythical [[King Arthur]] began to show him dressed in blue.  The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden [[fleur-de-lis]] or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Blue – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once blue became the colour of the king, it also became the colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe. In the Middle Ages in France and to some extent in Italy, the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state. In Italy, the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild, the ''tintori di guado,'' and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty. The wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson, ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'' (1956), Dover Publications, New York, ({{ISBN|0-486-20327-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ultramarine, several other blues were widely used in the Middle Ages and later in the Renaissance. [[Azurite]], a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a substitute for ultramarine. The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour''. pp.&amp;nbsp;139–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Another blue often used in the Middle Ages was called tournesol or folium. It was made from the plant [[Crozophora tinctoria]], which grew in the south of France. It made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour. pp.&amp;nbsp;141–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common blue pigment was [[smalt]], which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder. It made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine, and was vivid in frescoes, but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings. It became especially popular in the 17th century, when ultramarine was difficult to obtain. It was employed at times by [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[El Greco]], [[Van Dyck]], [[Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the European Renaissance===
In the Renaissance, a revolution occurred in painting; artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen, with perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. Artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules.  In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary, and identify her. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights. [[Raphael]] was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned. The contract for the ''Madone des Harpies'' by [[Andrea del Sarto]] (1514) required that the robe of the Virgin Mary be coloured with ultramarine costing "at least five good florins an ounce."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; Good ultramarine was more expensive than gold; in 1508 the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats – the equivalent of forty-one grams of gold – for just thirty grams of ultramarine.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues, such as azurite smalt, or pigments made with indigo, but this sometimes caused problems. Pigments made from azurite were less expensive, but tended to turn dark and green with time. An example is the robe of the Virgin Mary in The ''[[Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints (Raphael)|Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints]]'' by [[Raphael]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in New York. The Virgin Mary's azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001822|title=Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio or Santi) – Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=metmuseum.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704115007/http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001822|archivedate=2012-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used.  Ultramarine pigment, for instance, was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in [[tempera]] painting, in frescoes.  To balance their colours, Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine.  The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titian]] created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through, which made a complex and luminous colour, like stained glass. He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine, which gave subtle variations to the blue.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', pp.&amp;nbsp;186–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue and white porcelain===
In about the 9th century, Chinese artisans abandoned the [[Han blue]] colour they had used for centuries, and began to use [[cobalt blue]], made with [[cobalt]] salts of [[alumina]], to manufacture fine [[blue and white porcelain]], The plates and vases were shaped, dried, the paint applied with a brush, covered with a clear glaze, then fired at a high temperature. Beginning in the 14th century, this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to Europe where it inspired a whole style of art, called [[Chinoiserie]].  European courts tried for many years to imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain, but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from China.

Other famous white and blue patterns appeared in Delft, Meissen, Staffordshire, and Saint Petersburg, Russia.

===War of the blues – indigo versus woad===
[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Vermeer]] used natural ultramarine in his paintings, as in his ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. The expense was probably borne by his wealthy patron [[Pieter van Ruijven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Girl with a Pearl Earring |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/girl_with_a_pearl_earring.html |publisher=essentialvermeer.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630060601/http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/girl_with_a_pearl_earring.html |archivedate=2015-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While blue was an expensive and prestigious colour in European painting, it became a common colour for clothing during the Renaissance. The rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to a blue dye industry in several cities, notably [[Amiens]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Erfurt]]. They made a dye called pastel from [[woad]], a plant common in Europe, which had been used to make blue dye by the Celts and German tribes.  Blue became a colour worn by domestics and artisans, not just nobles. In 1570, when Pope [[Pius V]] listed the colours that could be used for ecclesiastical dress and for altar decoration, he excluded blue, because he considered it too common.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur effets et symboliques'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of making blue with woad was long and noxious – it involved soaking the leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine, ideally urine from men who had been drinking a great deal of alcohol, which was said to improve the colour. The fabric was then soaked for a day in the resulting mixture, then put out in the sun, where as it dried it turned blue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The pastel industry was threatened in the 15th century by the arrival from India of the same dye ([[indigo]]), obtained from a shrub widely grown in Asia. The Asian indigo dye precursors is more readily obtained. In 1498, [[Vasco de Gama]] opened a trade route to import indigo from India to Europe.  In India, the indigo leaves were soaked in water, fermented, pressed into cakes, dried into bricks, then carried to the ports London, Marseille, Genoa, and Bruges. Later, in the 17th century, the British, Spanish, and Dutch established indigo plantations in Jamaica, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands and South America, and began to import American indigo to Europe.

The countries with large and prosperous pastel industries tried to block the use of indigo. The German government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577, describing it as a "pernicious, deceitful and corrosive substance, the Devil's dye."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13242/13242-8.txt ''Lippincott's Magazine of Popular Literature and Science'', Volume 17, No. 100, April 1876] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106154802/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13242/13242-8.txt |date=2012-11-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D G Schreber, ''Historische, physische und economische Beschreibung des Waidtes'', 1752, the appendix; Thorpe JF and Ingold CK, 1923, ''Synthetic colouring matters – vat colours'' (London: Longmans, Green), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], in an edict of 1609, forbade under pain of death the use of "the false and pernicious Indian drug".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucaud |first=Édouard |editor-last=Frost |editor-first=John |title=The book of illustrious mechanics of Europe and America |year=1846 |page=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaQbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629124556/https://books.google.com/books?id=TaQbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 |archivedate=2016-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was forbidden in England until 1611, when British traders established their own indigo industry in India and began to import it into Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts to block indigo were in vain; the quality of indigo blue was too high and the price too low for pastel made from woad to compete. In 1737 both the French and German governments finally allowed the use of indigo. This ruined the dye industries in Toulouse and the other cities that produced pastel, but created a thriving new indigo commerce to seaports such as Bordeaux, Nantes and Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;F. Lauterbach, ''Der Kampf des Waides mit dem Indigo'', Leipzig, p. 25. Cited by Michel Pastoureau, Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;108–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another war of the blues took place at the end of the 19th century, between indigo and synthetic indigo, discovered in 1868 by the German chemist Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer. The German chemical firm BASF put the new dye on the market in 1897, in direct competition with the British-run indigo industry in India, which produced most of the world's indigo. In 1897 Britain sold ten thousand tons of natural indigo on the world market, while BASF sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo. The British industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers, but it was unable to compete; the synthetic indigo was more pure, made a more lasting blue, and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests. In 1911, India sold only 660 tons of natural indigo, while BASF sold 22,000 tons of synthetic indigo.  In 2002, more than 38,000 tons of synthetic indigo was produced, often for the production of blue jeans.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Elmar Steingruber "Indigo and Indigo Colorants" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue uniform===
[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|New York City police officers on Times Square (2010).]]
In the 17th century, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], was one of the first rulers to give his army blue uniforms. The reasons were economic; the German states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye. When Brandenburg became the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] in 1701, the uniform colour was adopted by the Prussian army. Most German soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the [[First World War]], with the exception of the Bavarians, who wore light blue.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks in part to the availability of indigo dye, the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms. Prior to 1748, British naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs. In 1748, the British uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue, now known as [[navy blue]].&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Hill, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy'', Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Continental Navy]] of the United States was created in 1775, it largely copied the British uniform and colour.

In the late 18th century, the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution. In October 1774, even before the United States declared its independence, [[George Mason]] and one hundred Virginia neighbours of [[George Washington]] organised a voluntary militia unit (the Fairfax County Independent Company of Volunteers) and elected Washington the honorary commander.  For their uniforms they chose blue and [[Buff (colour)|buff]], the colours of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], the opposition party in England, whose policies were supported by George Washington and many other [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blueandbuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/buff-and-blue-whig-politics-in-late.html|title=Blue and Buff: Buff and Blue: Whig politics in the late 18th century|author=Blue and Buff|website=blueandbuff.blogspot.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416121410/http://blueandbuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/buff-and-blue-whig-politics-in-late.html|archivedate=2014-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Chernow]], ''[[Washington: A Life]]'', p. 174. {{ISBN|978-0-14-311996-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Continental Army]] was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]], the first [[Continental Congress]] declared that the official uniform colour would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and [[buff (colour)|buff]]. Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until 1902, and is still the colour of the dress uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html|title=Army Dress Uniform|website=army.mil|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119095538/http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html|archivedate=2014-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the [[Gardes Françaises]], the elite regiment which protected [[Louis XVI]], wore dark blue uniforms with red trim. In 1789, the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people, and they played a leading role in the [[storming of the Bastille]]. After the fall of Bastille, a new armed force, the [[Garde Nationale]], was formed under the command of the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who had served with George Washington in America. Lafayette gave the Garde Nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the Continental Army. Blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies, opposed to the white uniforms of the Royalists and the Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tulard, Jean-François Fayard, Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française'', 1789–1799, Éditions Robert Laffont, collection Bouquins, Paris, 1987. {{ISBN|2-7028-2076-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] abandoned many of the doctrines of the French Revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army, although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye, since the British controlled the seas and blocked the importation of indigo to France. Napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad, which had an inferior blue colour.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;137–40&lt;/ref&gt; The French army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until 1915, when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of [[World War I]].  It was replaced with uniforms of a light blue-grey colour called horizon blue.

Blue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the 18th century, but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority, the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants. It was considered serious and authoritative, without being menacing. In 1829, when [[Robert Peel]] created the first [[London Metropolitan Police]], he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark, almost black blue, to make the policemen look different from soldiers, who until then had patrolled the streets. The traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the London "bobbie" was not abandoned until the mid-1990s, when it was replaced by a light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as NATO blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm|title=History|author=Metropolitan Police|website=met.police.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081203173318/http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm|archivedate=2008-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Police Department]], modelled after the London Metropolitan Police, was created in 1844, and in 1853, they were officially given a navy blue uniform, the colour they wear today.&lt;ref name="okidegbe"&gt;{{Citation |last=Okidegbe |first=Ngozi |chapter=I Love a Man in Uniform: The Debate Surrounding Uniforming the New York Police Force in the 19th Century |editor-last=Wiggerich |editor-first=Sandro |editor2-last=Kensy |editor2-first=Steven |title=Staat Macht Uniform |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |publication-date=2011 |isbn=978-3-515-09933-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for the perfect blue===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, chemists in Europe tried to discover a way to create synthetic blue pigments, avoiding the expense of importing and grinding lapis lazuli, azurite and other minerals. The Egyptians had created a synthetic colour, Egyptian blue, three thousand years BC, but the formula had been lost. The Chinese had also created synthetic pigments, but the formula was not known in the west.

In 1709 a German druggist and pigment maker named [[Johann Jacob Diesbach]] accidentally discovered a new blue while experimenting with potassium and iron sulphides. The new colour was first called Berlin blue, but later became known as [[Prussian blue]]. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter [[Antoine Watteau]], and later his successor [[Nicolas Lancret]]. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – HIstoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;114–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of [[Nagasaki]]. It was called ''bero-ai'', or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, ''ai-gami'', made from the [[dayflower]]. Prussian blue was used by both [[Hokusai]], in his famous wave paintings, and [[Hiroshige]].&lt;ref&gt;oger Keyes, ''Japanese Woodblock Prints: A Catalogue of the Mary A. Ainsworth Collection'', R, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, 1984, p. 42, plate #140, p. 91 and catalogue entry #439, p. 185.  for more on the story of Prussian blue in Japanese prints, see also the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824 the [[Societé pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie]] in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial [[ultramarine]] which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, [[Christian Gmelin]] then a professor of chemistry in Tübingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul (1930).  ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: McGraw Hill p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878 a German chemist named a. Von Baeyer discovered a synthetic substitute for [[indigotine]], the active ingredient of indigo. This product gradually replaced natural indigo, and after the end of the First World War, it brought an end to the trade of indigo from the East and West Indies.

In 1901 a new synthetic blue dye, called [[Indanthrone blue]], was invented, which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun. This dye gradually replaced artificial indigo, whose production ceased in about 1970. Today almost all blue clothing is dyed with an indanthrone blue.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur,'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impressionist painters===
The invention of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters. [[J.M.W. Turner]] experimented with the new cobalt blue, and of the twenty colours most used by the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], twelve were new and synthetic colours, including cobalt blue, ultramarine and cerulean blue.&lt;ref name="Ball265"&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important influence on painting in the 19th century was the theory of complementary colours, developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839. He demonstrated that placing complementary colours, such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow, next to each other heightened the intensity of each colour "to the apogee of their tonality."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Eugene Chevreul, ''De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs'', Paris,  (1839).  Cited by Philip Ball, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1879 an American physicist, Ogden Rood, published a book charting the complementary colours of each colour in the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Rood, Modern Chromatics, (1879).&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his ''Impression – Sunrise – Fog'' (1872), where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun, (1872) and in ''Régate à Argenteuil'' (1872), where he painted an orange sun against blue water. The colours brighten each other. Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in ''Canotage sur la Seine'' (1879–1880). Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colours, without any blending.&lt;ref name="Ball265"/&gt;

Monet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of colour. In his ''La Gare Saint-Lazare'', the grey smoke, vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment, including cobalt blue, cerulean blue, synthetic ultramarine, emerald green, Guillet green, chrome yellow, vermilion and ecarlate red.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters, who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods, feelings and atmospheres. [[Cobalt blue]], a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide, was a favourite of [[Auguste Renoir]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was similar to [[smalt]], a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass, but it was much improved by the French chemist [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], who introduced it in 1802.  It was very stable but extremely expensive. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, "'Cobalt [blue] is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cobalt blue |url=http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/coblue.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620100134/http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/coblue.html |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh described to his brother Theo how he composed a sky: "The dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt, and others of a lighter blue, like the bluish white of the Milky Way&amp;nbsp;... the sea was very dark ultramarine, the shore a sort of violet and of light red as I see it, and on the dunes, a few bushes of prussian blue."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his brother Theo, (1888). Cited by Philip Ball, from ''Letters of Vincent van Gogh'', edited by M. Roskill, Flamingo, London, 2000. p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue suit===
Blue had first become the high fashion colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe in the 13th century, when it was worn by [[Louis IX of France]], better known as Saint Louis (1214-1270).  Wearing blue implied dignity and wealth, and blue clothing was restricted to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson (1956), ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', Dover Publications, New York ({{ISBN|0-486-20327-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; However, blue was replaced by black as the power colour in the 14th century, when European princes, and then merchants and bankers, wanted to show their seriousness, dignity and devoutness (see [[Black]]).

Blue gradually returned to court fashion in the 17th century, as part of a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit has its roots in England in the middle of the 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the [[London fire]] of 1666, King [[Charles II of England]] ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.&lt;ref name="SuitablyDressed"&gt;"Suitably Dressed," the ''Economist'', December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the American Revolution, the leader of the Whig Party in England, [[Charles James Fox]], wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat and breeches, the colours of the Whig Party and of the uniform of [[George Washington]], whose principles he supported. The men's suit followed the basic form of the military uniforms of the time, particularly the uniforms of the cavalry.&lt;ref name="SuitablyDressed"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, during the [[British Regency|Regency]] of the future King [[George IV]], the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George [[Beau Brummel]]. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form.  The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight trousers to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on the form of the body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, "If people turn to look at you in the street, you are not well dressed."&lt;ref&gt;*Kelly, Ian. ''Beau Brummell: The Ultimate Dandy''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes.  Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.&lt;ref name="SuitablyDressed"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In the 20th and 21st century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, many artists recognised the emotional power of blue, and made it the central element of paintings. During his [[Blue Period]] (1901–1904) [[Pablo Picasso]] used blue and green, with hardly any warm colours, to create a melancholy mood. In Russia, the [[symbolist]] painter [[Pavel Kuznetsov]] and the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] art group (1906–1908) used blue to create a fantastic and exotic atmosphere. In Germany, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and other Russian émigrés formed the art group called [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), and used blue to symbolise spirituality and eternity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Wassily Kandinsky, M. T. Sadler (Translator) ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Dover Publ. (Paperback). 80 pp.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-486-23411-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Matisse]] used intense blues to express the emotions he wanted viewers to feel. Matisse wrote, "A certain blue penetrates your soul."&lt;ref&gt;"Un certain bleu pénètre votre âme." Cited by C.A. Riley, ''Color Codes'', University Press of New England, Hanover, New Hampshire, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the art of the second half of the 20th century, painters of the [[abstract expressionist]] movement began to use blue and other colours in pure form, without any attempt to represent anything, to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter [[Mark Rothko]] observed that colour was "only an instrument;" his interest was "in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;''Mark Rothko 1903–1970''. Tate Gallery Publishing, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fashion blue, particularly dark blue, was seen as a colour which was serious but not grim. In the mid-20th century, blue passed black as the most common colour of men's business suits, the costume usually worn by political and business leaders. Public opinion polls in the United States and Europe showed that blue was the favourite colour of over fifty per cent of respondents. Green was far behind with twenty per cent, while white and red received about eight per cent each.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;149–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 a German immigrant in San Francisco, [[Levi Strauss]], invented a sturdy kind of work trousers, made of [[denim]] fabric and coloured with [[indigo]] dye, called [[jeans|blue jeans]]. In 1935, they were raised to the level of high fashion by [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue magazine]]. Beginning in the 1950s, they became an essential part of uniform of young people in the United States, Europe, and around the world.

Blue was also seen as a colour which was authoritative without being threatening. Following the [[Second World War]], blue was adopted as the colour of important international organisations, including the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]], [[UNESCO]], the European Union, and [[NATO]]. United Nations peacekeepers wear blue helmets to stress their peacekeeping role. Blue is used by the [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems]] to denote friendly forces, hence the term "blue on blue" for [[friendly fire]], and [[Blue Force Tracking]] for location of friendly units. The [[People's Liberation Army]] of China (formerly known as the "Red Army") uses the term "Blue Army" to refer to hostile forces during exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/army/organisation/blue-army.asp|title=Blue Army (OPFOR) Units|accessdate=2013-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814034817/http://www.sinodefence.com/army/organisation/blue-army.asp|archivedate=2013-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw the invention of new ways of creating blue, such as [[chemiluminescence]], making blue light through a chemical reaction.

In the 20th century, it also became possible to own your own colour of blue. The French artist [[Yves Klein]], with the help of a French paint dealer, created a specific blue called [[International Klein blue]], which he patented. It was made of ultramarine combined with a resin called Rhodopa, which gave it a particularly brilliant colour. The baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers developed its own blue, called [[Dodger blue]], and several American universities invented new blues for their colours.

With the dawn of the [[World Wide Web]], blue has become the standard colour for [[hyperlinks]] in [[Graphical user interface|graphic browsers]] (though in most browsers links turn purple if you visit their target), to make their presence within text obvious to readers.

===Politics===
{{main article|Political colour}}
* In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Blues and the Greens were the most prominent political factions in the capital. They took their names from the colours of the two most popular [[chariot racing]] teams at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Edward Gibbon 1960 pg. 554"&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' (abridged edition), Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York, (1960), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The word ''blue'' was used in England the 17th century as a disparaging reference to rigid moral codes and those who observed them, particularly in ''blue-stocking'', a reference to Oliver Cromwell's supporters in the parliament of 1653.
* In the middle of the 18th century, blue was the colour of [[Tory]] party, then the opposition party in England, Scotland and Ireland, which supported the British monarch and power of the landed aristocracy, while the ruling [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] had orange as their colour.  Flags of the two colours are seen over a polling station in the series of prints by [[William Hogarth]] called [[Humours of an election]],  made in 1754–55. Blue remains the colour of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party of the UK]] today.

'''Burnell Poole''' (30 August 1884 – 1933) was an American [[marine artist|naval artist]].

==Early life==

Burnell Poole was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He married in 1920 to his only wife, Constance; they had a son, Burnell Poole, Jr., in 1924.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

==Naval Artist==

During the First World War he took hundreds of photographs of the work of [[US Navy]] shipyards. Poole was commissioned by the Navy as a war artist to paint oil canvases of warships at sea.

Describing one of these paintings, now held by the [[Naval Historical Foundation]], the artist commented that "This painting depicts the U.S. Destroyer [[USS Allen (DD-66)|''Allen'']] escorting the troop transport [[SS Leviathan|''Leviathan'']]  through the danger zone on a typical dull day in the North Atlantic in rough weather. The visibility is fair", and "Under such conditions the ''Leviathan'' made about 23 or 24 knots necessitating 25 or 26 [knots] for the destroyer on account of her independent zigzag course."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="A Fast Convoy" by Burnell Poole|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/exhibits/fast-convoy.html|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">'''Chinese pigments''' ({{zh|t=中國國畫傳統顏料}}) are the traditional medium to execute [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese brush paintings]], besides [[inkstick|ink]]. Chinese pigments is similar to Western [[gouache]] paint in that it contains more glue than [[watercolours]], but more so than gouache. The high glue content makes the pigment bind better to Chinese paper and silk as well as enabling works of art to survive the wet-mounting process of Chinese [[hanging scroll]] mountings without smudging or bleeding.

==Types==
Traditionally, Chinese pigments come in form of chips, cakes or powder made from natural plant and minerals. Some of these require preparation by adding glue (明膠) before they can be used. Traditional pigments require some skill and knowledge to mix as some pigments do not blend well with others (e.g. herbal and stone colours generally do not combine well). Also, layering a different pigment on top of another can create different effects depending on the type and transparency of the upper layer pigment. 

Synthetic versions that already contain glue come in tubes and are more convenient.

==Traditional colours==
Out of the many pigments used for traditional colours, around 12 are basic colours that are widely used. Some of the pigments use natural plant ('herbal') or minerals ('stone') that are poisonous or toxic. Outside of these traditional pigments, other colours are made from synthetic chemicals. 

===Reds===
*[[Cinnabar]] powder (硃砂粉). Basic stone colour. Requires glue. 
*[[Vermilion]] cake (朱膘膏). Basic stone colour.
*Vermilion powder (銀朱粉). Essentially, a synthetic form of [[mercury sulfide]], more brilliant than traditional vermilion made from ground cinnabar. 
*[[Eosin]] red cake (曙紅膏). Basic herbal colour. It is now used in replacement of traditional carmine. 
*[[Carmine]] powder (洋紅粉). Very expensive, it is now replaced with substitutes. 
*[[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge]] (胭脂). Basic herbal colour. Usually comes in cream form. 
*[[Scarlet (color)|Scarlet]] cake (大紅膏). Synthetic colour. 
*[[Dark red]] cake (深紅膏). Synthetic colour.

===Blues===
*[[Azurite]] (石青). Basic stone colour. Comes in four shades, from dark to light: 頭青, 二青, 三青, 四青. Requires glue. 
*[[Indigo]] cake (花青膏). Basic herbal colour. 
*[[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|Phthalocyanine blue]]/[[cyanine]] (酞菁藍). Basic synthetic colour.
*[[Azure (color)|Azure]] cake (天[蘭/藍]膏). Basic synthetic colour. 

===Yellows===
All traditional yellow pigments are toxic. Because of this, modern synthetic substitutes are often used. 

*[[Gamboge]] (藤黃). Basic herbal colour. Comes in flakes or stick form. 
*[[Chrome yellow]] cake (鉻黃膏). Stone colour. 
*[[Realgar]] (雄黃). Stone colour. Requires glue. 
*[[Orpiment]] (雌黃). Stone colour. Requires glue. 
*[[Litharge]]/[[Lead monoxide]] (密陀僧). Synthetic colour. Requires glue.
*[[Gold]] powder (金粉). Requires glue.

===Greens===
*[[Malachite]] (石綠). Basic stone colour. Comes in four shades, from dark to light: 頭綠, 二綠, 三綠, 四綠. Requires glue.
*[[Jadeite]] powder (碧玉粉). Stone colour. Requires glue.

===Browns===
*[[Ochre]]/[[burnt sienna]] cake (赭石膏). Basic stone colour.
*Burnt [[umber]] (焦茶). Herbal colour. Requires glue.

===Whites===
In modern practice, painters tend to use white [[gouache]] paint as a substitute to traditional whites, typically for underpainting.

*[[Clam]] shell cake (蛤白膏). Made of ground white clam shells. 
*[[Calcite]] powder (白方解). Stone colour. Requires glue.
*[[Titanium white]] (鈦白). Modern synthetic colour. Appears in modern sets of tube colours.
*[[Zinc white]] (鋅白). Modern synthetic colour. Sometimes called Chinese white. Appears in old sets of tube colours.
*[[Lead white]] (鉛白). Synthetic colour. Traditionally used in the past. Comes in flakes or powder form. 
*[[Mother of pearl]] powder (雲母粉). Requires glue.
*[[Silver]] powder (銀粉). Requires glue.

===Blacks===
*[[Ink]] (墨). From ground inksticks made of pine, oil, lacquer or charcoal soot.
*[[Obsidian]] (岩黑). Requires glue.
*[[Black]] (黑). Synthetic pigment from tubes.

[[Image:Inferno Canto 6 lines 49-52.jpg|thumb|Dante meets Ciacco. Engraving by [[Gustave Doré]]]]   
'''''Ciacco''''' {{IPA-it|ˈtʃakko|}} is one of the characters in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]] that were not yet well defined by historians. This is how he presents himself to Dante when he is in [[Inferno (Dante)|Hell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
«Voi cittadini mi chiamaste Ciacco;
per la dannosa colpa de la gola,
come tu vedi, a la pioggia mi fiacco.»

«Ye citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony,
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.»

''(Inferno, VI, 52-54)''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This way introducing himself allows us to interpret it in various ways, but one of the oldest commentators of the Comedy suggests a derogatory nature of this name: "Ciacco is said to be a pig's name, hence he was called this way for his gluttony."

[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] makes of Ciacco eighth story of the ninth day of the ''[[Decameron]]'', describing him as "the most gluttonous fellow that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;558&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reference to Ciacco's name is somewhat ambiguous: he is referred to as the man "whom everyone called Ciacco."&lt;ref&gt;558&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to say if Boccaccio had sources for his writings aside from Dante, because this name has not been found in literature before Dante. According to Vittorio Sermonti, a scholar dedicated to the study of the Comedy, the hypothesis that this Ciacco is the poet Ciacco dell'Anguillara is not true{{fact|date=August 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">In [[mathematics]], '''continuous symmetry''' is an intuitive idea corresponding to the concept of viewing some [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] as [[Motion (physics)|motion]]s, as opposed to [[discrete symmetry]], e.g. [[reflection symmetry]], which is invariant under a kind of flip from one state to another. However, a discrete symmetry can always be reinterpreted as a subset of some higher-dimensional continuous symmetry, e.g. reflection of a 2 dimensional object in 3 dimensional space can be achieved by continuously rotating that object 180 degrees across a non-parallel plane.

==Formalization==
The notion of continuous symmetry has largely and successfully been formalised in the mathematical notions of [[topological group]], [[Lie group]] and [[group action]]. For most practical purposes continuous symmetry is modelled by a ''group action'' of a topological group that preserves some structure. Particularly, let &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function, and ''G'' is a group that acts on ''X'' then a subgroup &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry of ''f'' if &lt;math&gt;f(h\cdot x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;.''

===One-parameter subgroups===
The simplest motions follow a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of a Lie group, such as the [[Euclidean group]] of [[three-dimensional space]]. For example [[translation (geometry)|translation]] parallel to the ''x''-axis by ''u'' units, as ''u'' varies, is a one-parameter group of motions. Rotation around the ''z''-axis is also a one-parameter group.

==Noether's theorem==
Continuous symmetry has a basic role in [[Noether's theorem]] in [[theoretical physics]], in the derivation of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s from symmetry principles, specifically for continuous symmetries. The search for continuous symmetries only intensified with the further developments of [[quantum field theory]].

[[File:Cristo de don Fernando y doña Sancha (reverso).jpg|thumb|upright|Reverse.]]
The '''[[crucifix]] of Ferdinand and Sancha''' ({{lang-es|crucifijo de don Fernando y doña Sancha}}) is an [[ivory carving]] from ''circa'' 1063, today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]. It was part of an offering by King [[Ferdinand I of León]] and [[Sancha of León|Queen Sancha]] to furnish the basilica of [[San Isidoro de León]]. It is the earliest known crucifix from Spain depicting the [[body of Christ]]. Although earlier Spanish crucifices of gold, ivory and wood are known, they are all without images. The official inventory of the royal gift describes the crucifix as "a cross of ivory with the image of our crucified Redeemer".&lt;ref&gt;Gómez-Moreno (1947), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 52&amp;nbsp;cm high, 34.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick, with the width of the cross beams being 7&amp;nbsp;cm. The image of Christ is 305&amp;nbsp;mm tall.

The figure of Christ is shown with its heading reclining to the left, its large eyes wide open and encrusted with [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], and sporting a beard and moustache. (Jet eyes were common at the time in ivory sculptures of the region.) Each foot is shown nailed individually to the cross. The fingers of Christ's right hand are missing. His ''perizonium'' (loin cloth) covers him to the knees and is tied at his waist. The legs and torso are perfectly vertical. There is a small space behind the body so the piece could serve as a [[reliquary]], as was typical.

On the obverse of the cross are intertwined images of plants and animals, and of humans either ascending to paradise or descending to hell. Above the image of Christ is the inscription:
&lt;center&gt;IHSNAZA&lt;br&gt;RENUSREX&lt;br&gt;IUDEORU&lt;/center&gt;
which transaltes "[[INRI|Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews]]", the citation placed on the cross according to the [[Four Gospels]]. Above the inscription on the ivory is a representation of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Christ]] carrying a cross. At the base of the cross, below the crucified figure, is a figure of [[Adam]], and below that the inscription:
&lt;center&gt;FREDINANDUSREX&lt;br&gt;SANCIAREGINA&lt;/center&gt;
indicating the commissioners of the work, King Ferdinand and Queen Sancha. The reverse of the cross bears plant figures, in the centre the [[Agnus Dei]], and at the four extremities of the arms the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]].

[[File:john.gower.southwark.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Effigy and monument to [[John Gower]] (c.1330-1408) in [[Southwark Cathedral]], London]]
A '''church monument''' is an [[architecture|architectural]] or [[sculpture|sculptural]] [[memorial]] to a [[death|deceased]] person or persons, located within a [[Christian]] [[church (building)|church]]. It can take various forms ranging from a simple [[commemorative plaque]] or mural tablet affixed to a wall, to a large and elaborate structure, on the ground or as a mural monument, which may include an [[effigy]] of the deceased person and other figures of familial, [[heraldry|heraldic]] or symbolic nature. It is usually placed immediately above or close to the actual [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] or [[Grave (burial)|grave]], although very occasionally the [[tomb]] is constructed within it. Sometimes the monument is a [[cenotaph]], commemorating a person buried at another location. 

Once only the subject of antiquarian curiosity, church monuments are today recognised as works of [[funerary art]]. They are also valued by historians as giving a highly detailed record of antique [[costume]] and [[armour]], by [[genealogist]]s as a permanent and contemporary record of familial relationships and dates, and by students of [[heraldry]] as providing reliable depictions for heraldic [[blazon]]s. From the middle of the 15th century, many figurative monuments started to represent genuine [[portrait]]ure where before had existed only generalised representations.

==Development==
===Medieval period===
The earliest English church monuments were simple stone [[coffin]]-shaped grave coverings incised with a cross or similar design; the [[hogback (sculpture)|hogback]] form is one of the earliest types. The first attempts at commemorative portraiture emerged in the 13th century, executed in low relief, horizontal but as in life. Gradually these became full high-relief [[effigy|effigies]], usually [[recumbent effigy|recumbent]], as in death, and, by the 14th century, with hands together in prayer. In general, such '''monumental effigies''' were carved in stone, marble or wood, or cast in bronze or brass. Often the stone effigies were painted to resemble life, but on the vast majority of medieval monuments, the paint has long since disappeared. The cross-legged attitude of many armoured figures of the late 13th or early 14th centuries was long supposed to imply that the deceased had served in the [[Crusades]], had taken crusading vows, or more specifically had been a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]]; but these theories are now rejected by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Puckle, Bertram S.

By the early 13th century, the effigies were raised on tomb-style chests (known as '''tomb chests''', '''altar tombs''' or '''table tombs''') decorated with foliage, [[heraldry]] or [[architecture|architectural]] detailing. Soon such chests stood alone with varying degrees of decorations. By the end of the century, these often had architectural [[canopy (building)|canopies]].  Small figures of [[weepers]] (often friends or relatives identified by their [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]) were popular decorative features. In the 15th century, the figures were often portrayed as [[angel]]s or [[saint]]s, and the chest might include a [[cadaver tomb|cadaver]]. The most refined monuments were made of [[alabaster]]. Around the 13th century, smaller two-dimensional effigies incised in plates of brass and affixed to monumental slabs of stone became popular too. These [[monumental brass|memorial brasses]] were somewhat cheaper and particularly popular with the emerging middle class.

===Early modern period===
The removal of almost all the many wall-paintings in English churches in the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[English Reformation]] and the [[English Commonwealth]] left plenty of bare spaces. Over the following centuries, these were gradually filled by monuments of the wealthy. It is the lack of competition from religious paintings and a tolerance of figurative sculpture in memorials, which most Protestant countries did not share, that produced the exceptionally rich English holdings of large sculptural church monuments. 
 
In the 16th century, church monuments became increasingly influenced by [[Renaissance]] forms and detailing (pilasters, wreaths, strapwork, skulls, [[coffer]]ed arches, [[obelisk]]s, [[allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]], etc.), particularly in France, the Netherlands and, eventually, England. There were major innovations in effigial posture, the deceased often being shown reclining or kneeling in prayer and surrounded by the whole family, as in life. Cadavers were replaced by skeletons. The 'hanging' '''mural''' or '''wall monument''' also became popular, sometimes with half-length 'demi-figures'; and also the floor-bound heraldic [[ledger stone]]. The 17th century saw an increase in [[classicism]] and the use of [[marble]]. Effigies might be sitting or standing, grief-stricken, shrouded or, unusually, rising from the grave. [[Bust (sculpture)|Busts]] and relief portraits were popular. High [[Baroque]] monuments were some of the grandest ever constructed. Decoration turned to cherubs, urns, drapery, garlands of fruit and flowers. In the 18th century, church monuments became more restrained, placed before two-dimensional pyramids, but more Roman-like, with the deceased often depicted in Roman dress or as a [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]-like 'medallion portrait'. The [[Rococo]] style gave more movement to these figures.

===Victorian period===
The early 19th century brought [[Greek Revival]] monuments, some quite plain wall plaques, some with sentimental and romantically realistic figures (perhaps rising to heaven), or other devices such as [[willow|weeping willows]]. [[Gothic Revival]] followed, with the obvious return to alabaster, tomb chests and recumbent effigies. However, the [[Victorian period|Victorian age]] saw many differing styles, until large-scale monuments fell out of fashion at the end of the century. 20th-century large-scale monuments are not unknown, but quite rare.

==Examples of English church monuments==
The church monuments of England, in particular, have been preserved in far greater numbers and, generally, in better condition than those of other countries. They are second to none in artistic merit. Fine examples may be found in cathedrals and parish churches in every county.

==''An Arundel Tomb''==
[[File:ArundelTomb2.JPG|thumb|upright|The subject of ''An Arundel Tomb'']]One of the best-known poems by 20th-century English poet [[Philip Larkin]] was inspired by a 14th-century English effigial monument.

Note the stylized lion and dog figures at the feet of the lord and lady, respectively.

'''Fausto Zonaro''' (18 September 1854 – 19 July 1929) was an Italian painter, best known for his [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] style paintings of life and history of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Life==

===Young life and early art career===
[[Image:Ertugrulsuvarialayi zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|left|''Il reggimento imperiale di Ertugrul sul ponte di Galata'' (''The Imperial Regiment of the Ertugrul on the [[Galata Bridge]]'')]]
Fausto Zonaro was born in [[Masi, Province of Padua|Masi]], a municipality in the [[Province of Padua]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. He was the eldest child of the mason Maurizio and his wife Elisabetta Bertoncin. Maurizio intended that his son should also be a mason, yet at a young age, Fausto showed a great ability at [[drawing]].&lt;ref name =FBIO&gt;http://www.faustozonaro.it/biografia.html&lt;/ref&gt; With his parents’ consent, he enrolled first in the Technical Institute in [[Lendinara]], then in the [[Cignaroli Academy]] in [[Verona]] under [[Napoleone Nani]]. Fausto opened a small art school and studio in [[Venice]], but traveled often to [[Naples]] as well. He felt no clear direction in his life at that time.

He actively displayed works in exhibition and gained respect of critics. He painted mainly [[Genre painting|genre]] works in oil and watercolor. In 1883 at Milan, he exhibited: ''Le rivelatrici napoletane''; ''Da [[Castel Sant'Elmo|Sant'Elmo]]'', and ''Al [[Pincian Hill|Pincio]]''; in Rome, the canvases ''Passa la vacca''; ''La sofferente''; ''Le cucitrici napoletane'', and ''Il saponaro''. In 1884, at Turin: ''Tempesta''; ''Primo nato''; ''Primo tuono'', and the ''[[Mount Zoccolaro|Zoccolaro]] of Naples''; and in 1887 at Venice: ''In attesa''; ''Al Redentoretto'', and ''Lavoratrice di perle''. La casa Camerini of Padua once possessed a ''banditore''; and two canvases: ''I pigiatori'' and ''In medio stat virtus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.''], by [[Angelo de Gubernatis]]. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 562.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fausto Zonaro - Amusement at Göksu - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''On the [[Göksu]]'']]
The turning point in Zonaro’s career occurred however in 1891, when he fell in love with Elisabetta Pante, a pupil of his in Venice, And together they traveled to Istanbul, capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They were partly inspired by [[Edmondo de Amicis]]’ orientalist travel book ''Constantinopoli''.&lt;ref name =FBIO/&gt;

===Istanbul===

In 1892, Zonaro and Pante married, and lived in the Istanbul neighborhood of [[Beyoğlu|Pera]].

In Istanbul, over time he gained patronage in aristocratic circles. [[Munir Pasha]], the Minister of Protocol, who invited him to visit [[Yıldız Palace]] and meet the prestigious local artist [[Osman Hamdi Bey]]. He was employed in teaching painting to the Pasha's wife, and in this way Zonaro and Pante got to know the important artistic figures of Istanbul of that time. In 1896 he was nominated as the [[court painter]] ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''Ressam-ı Hazret-i Şehriyari'') thanks to the intervention of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] ambassador who had presented the ruling sultan [[Abdulhamid II]] with Zonaro’s work ''Il reggimento imperiale di Ertugrul sul ponte di Galata'' (in English: ''The Imperial Regiment of the Ertugrul on the Galata Bridge''), which Abdulhamid II had then purchased.

[[Image:Conquest of Constantinople, Zonaro.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Mehmed II]] and the [[Ottoman Army]] approaching [[Constantinople]], transporting a giant bombard'' by Zonaro.]]

&lt;!-- This painting is of the crew of the Ottoman warship ''[[Ottoman frigate Ertuğrul|Ertugrul]]'' which had just been sent off on a visit to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. NB: The years don't fit this guess; a cavalry regiment of the same name as the ship. --&gt;The Sultan later commissioned from Zonaro a series of paintings depicting events in the life of the 15th-century Ottoman sultan, [[Mehmed II]]. Holding the position of court painter, Zonaro viewed himself as the successor to the Venetian painter [[Gentile Bellini]], who had been commissioned by Mehmed II to paint his portrait over 300 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantinople - City of the World’s Desire 1453-1924'' by Philip Mansel&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fausto Zonaro - Kabak Taşıyan Genç Kız , Young Girl Carrying a Pumpkin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|Fausto Zonaro Young Girl Carrying a Pumpkin, 1889]]
Also during his stay in Istanbul, Zonaro witnessed the [[Day of Ashura]] processions carried out by the [[Shia]] Muslims on the tenth of Muharram, and it was the procession of [[Tatbir]] that inspired him to paint his renowned painting ''10th of Muharram'', it was reported that Zonaro said "After witnessing the horripilating procession (of Tatbir) I wish I were able to meet this man they mourn for". The "man" Zonaro speaks of indicates to the oppressed grandson of the Muslim prophet Mohammed, [[Hussein ibn Ali]].

===Return to Italy===
Zonaro remained in Istanbul until 1909, when he returned to Italy following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] that overthrew his patron Abdulhamid II and the shift to constitutional monarchy. There would be no Ottoman court painter after him.&lt;ref name =FBIO/&gt; He settled in [[Sanremo]] where he continued to paint small works depicting the [[Italian Riviera]] and the nearby [[French Riviera]] until his death.

In 1920 he separated from his wife and began living with his daughter. Nine years later, he died. He is buried in the Foce Cemetery in Sanremo. On his gravestone, underneath an Ottoman ''[[tughra]]'', it states that Zonaro was the court painter of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name =OSAR&gt;http://www.os-ar.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work and reputation==

Zonaro painted [[portrait]]s, [[landscape art|landscapes]] and [[history painting|historical paintings]]. It is claimed that “Zonaro was one of those who made a major contribution to the development of western style art in Turkey.”&lt;ref name =OSAR/&gt; He was a prolific artist who created hundreds of works, most of which are of the Ottoman Empire. An exhibition of his work in Florence in 1977 "received wide acclaim in the art world".&lt;ref name =OSAR/&gt;

Today, most of Zonaro’s works remain in Istanbul, and many of them are on display in the city’s leading museums. His pictures can be found in the state museums of [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] and the [[Istanbul Military Museum]]. Zonaro’s works can also be found in the private [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;http://muze.sabanciuniv.edu/collection/collection.php?lngCollectionID=12&amp;bytLanguageID=2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pera Museum]]. Also, a number of them belong to private collectors in Turkey.&lt;ref name =OSAR/&gt;

==Gallery==

Some of Zonaro's paintings are in the Pera Art Museum in Istanbul (including ''Daughter of the English Ambassador Riding in a Palanquin'') and the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">[[File:Cortile della Pigna - lance mountain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fontana della Pigna (1st century AD)]]
The '''Fontana della Pigna'''  or simply Pigna ("The Pine cone") is a former [[Fountain#Ancient Roman fountains|Roman fountain]] which now decorates a vast niche in the wall of the Vatican facing the Cortile della Pigna, located in [[Vatican City]], in Rome, Italy.   

==Description==
Composed of a large [[bronze]] [[Conifer cone|pine cone]] almost four meters high which once spouted water from the top, the Pigna originally stood near the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] next to the [[Temple of Isis and Serapis|Temple of Isis]].   It was moved to the courtyard of the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] during the Middle Ages and then moved again, in 1608,  to its present location.&lt;ref&gt;Official history on the Vatican website&lt;/ref&gt; 

The courtyard where it stands was originally part of the [[Cortile del Belvedere]], designed by [[Donato Bramante]] to connect the palace of [[Pope Innocent VIII]] with the [[Sistine Chapel]].  When Bramante died,  architect [[Pirro Ligorio]] finished the project and added the wall and niche to close the courtyard.  Construction of the [[Vatican Library]] divided the Cortile del Belvedere into two areas. The upper part of the courtyard, the Cortile della Pigna, takes its name from the fountain.

The bronze [[Peafowl|peacocks]] on either side of the fountain are copies of those decorating the tomb of the Emperor [[Hadrian]], now the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. The original peacocks are in the [[Vatican Museums#Sculpture museums|Braccio Nuovo Museum]].

==Rimini fountain==
There is another fountain known as Fontana della Pigna in [[Rimini]], Italy, also of Ancient Roman origin but heavily restored. The pine cone sculpture crowning this fountain was only installed in 1807, replacing a 16th-century statue of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] damaged by the [[Napoleon]]ic army.

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamar, “What Makes a Pollock Pollock: A Machine Vision Approach”, International Journal of Arts and Technology, vol. 8, 1-10, (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media''' is a non-profit research organization that researches gender representation in media and advocates for equal representation of women. Madeline Di Nonno joined as CEO of the Institute in 2009. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is currently headquartered at [[Mount St. Mary's University (Los Angeles)|Mount St. Mary’s University]], in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Geena Davis at the podium (9922450166).jpg|thumb|The founder Hollywood actress Geena Davis in a speech at the [[Millennium Development Goals]] Countdown event in the [[Ford Foundation Building]] in New York, addressing gender roles and issues in film (24 September 2013)]]
After watching children’s TV with her young daughter, [[Geena Davis]] noticed that the large majority of television shows lacked a large amount of female characters. This inspired her to think critically about what American media showed to young children; and to eventually investigate the role of gender in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/geena-davis-institute-on-gender-and-media-feminism-1201610886/|title=Geena Davis Makes Women the Center of Attention With Her Institute|last=Saval|first=Malina|date=2015-10-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She realized the importance of the female representation in children’s shows, as these representations can impact how young girls see themselves. &lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sarasotamagazine.com/articles/2017/2/13/geena-davis-gender-quality|title=Geena Davis Is On a Mission for Gender Equality in the Media|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Davis wanted to focus on television shows, films, and other media outlets that are intended for children under 11, as these are formative years for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting research on this type of entertainment, Davis found that three times more men than women appear in children’s television shows and films.The research also showed that characters in the workplace were 80.5% male and only 19.5% female.&lt;ref&gt; Marechal, AJ. “Davis Institute Tracks Gender Gaps in Media.” Salem State University , 23 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"/&gt; Davis studied "[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|122 G, PG, and PG-13 films]] theatrically-released between 2006 and 2009.” &lt;ref name="seejane.org1"&gt;https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/full-study-gender-disparity-in-family-films-v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, she found that “only 29.2% of all speaking characters are female,” and these women are more sexualized than the men.&lt;ref name="seejane.org1"/&gt; As “children are engaging with media up to 7-10 hours/day,” the representation of women in children’s television shows and films has a major impact on how young girls believe they should act and how they view themselves.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"/&gt; Davis subsequently founded the eponymous Institute in 2004.
At its core, the Geena Davis Institute believes that, too often, the media “sidelines, hypersexualizes, or simply omits” women, particularly in movies and television.&lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"/&gt;

Geena Davis was motivated to start her foundation because of her Academy Award Nominated role in [[Ridley Scott|Ridley Scott’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Thelma &amp; Louise|Thelma and Louise]], the 1991 film that she had said changed her life. When the film was released to overwhelming acclaim it made her realize just how few opportunities there were to see empowered female characters on screen, and it inspired her to establish her institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/06/how-geena-davis-became-a-champion-for-women-on-screen|title=How Geena Davis became a champion for women on screen|last=Spring|first=Alexandra|date=2017-03-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis said that throughout her career she consciously chose roles that would empower women and girls. She acknowledges that this was a luxury because she “hasn’t run out of money yet” and added that if she ever appeared as [[Sean Connery]]’s comatose wife, “about right, by Hollywood standards” - we should know she’s broke.

== Mission ==
Davis says the Institute targets the entertainment industry rather than the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seeks to increase diversity in casting and advocates for equal representation of women in media.  For example, Davis cited research by the Institute that 17% of people in crowd scenes are women.  Using her connections in the industry, Davis takes these statistics to media executives to educate them about the poor representation of women in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/geena-davis-on-fighting-for-more-roles-for-women.html|title=Geena Davis on Fighting for Female Representation in Hollywood and the Golden Age of Roles for Women|last=Hunt|first=Stacey Wilson|work=[[Vulture.com]]|date=2016-05-04|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's entertainment is a primary focus of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/mar/19/geena-davis--sexism-wasnt-present-in-what-w-show-kids|title=Geena Davis: 'I just assumed sexism wasn't present in what we show kids'|last=O'Conor|first=Lottie|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is the only research-based organization working within the media to exchange, educate, influence, and expound on the need for gender balance, and, it is a leading voice to create a wide variety of roles for females in the entertainment industry.  The Institute is against stereotyping of female characters, and it furthers calls for roles that empower women rather than denigrate them. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/geena-davis-study-press-release.|title=Geena Davis study press release|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Davis’ thoughts about the Gender Gap ==
Davis states, “The fact is women are seriously underrepresented in nearly all sectors of society across the globe, not just on screen, but, for the most part, we are simply not aware to this reality, and media images exert a powerful influence in perpetuating our unconscious bias” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the reasons that impelled Davis to start her foundation was personal experience with Hollywood’s sexist treatment of older women. Davis says, “Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40’s. If you look at [[IMDb|IMDB,]] up until that age I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40’s, I made one movie, [[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little.]]” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/158839-the-geena-davis-institute-is-helping-women-in-hollywood-but-not-all-of-them.|title=Geena Davis Is Fighting For Women In Hollywood|last=Atkinson|first=S.|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research impact ==
The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has garnered several notable accomplishments concerning their research. As an Institute, they have cultivated one of the largest repositories of research around the intersection of gender and media for the past 25 years.

The Institute has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media. In addition, the Institute collaborates with several other non-profits and for-profit corporations in order to highlight their feelings on the need to reform the way that women are represented in popular culture. Contributors to the Institute include scientists, non-profit coordinators, business leaders, as well as those involved in producing and acting in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Institute, along with the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation]], established a $5000 award for diversity in children's animation created by college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/geena-davis-institute-tv-acad-unveil-kid-s-award-1118025704/|title=Geena Davis Institute, TV Acad unveil kid’s award|last=Levine|first=Stuart|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2010-10-14|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current partnerships ==
The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has teamed-up with several multi-national corporations to achieve their goal of informing media consumers about the current state of women in popular culture. Recently, the Institute has partnered with Ford and several [[YouTube]] stars to create a video series entitled #ShesGotDrive. The partnership between [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and the Institute seeks to highlight several stories of women content creators overcoming significant challenges. Thus far, the campaign has featured [[Taryn Southern]], Yulin Kang, and [[Clara Chung|Clara C]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/geena-davis-partners-with-ford-to-fight-unconscious-gender-bias-in-media-its-a-hugely-important-cause-36389|title=Geena Davis Partners With Ford For #ShesGotDrive|first=Jordana|last=Lipsitz|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this campaign is to highlight the power of women in media and inspire other women to follow their dreams. In addition, the campaign seeks “to fight unconscious gender bias in media.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The Institute has also teamed up with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts of the United States of America]] (GSUSA) to create a program entitled Girls’ Fast Track Races. With this program, girls construct their own race cars. The program was created in order to foster learning of automobile engineering in young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/geena-davis-institute-and-ford-teamed-up-for-this-inspiring-video-series-promoting-gender-equality/|title=Geena Davis Institute and Ford Teamed Up for This Inspiring Video Series Promoting Gender Equality|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in 2016, the Institute received a 1.2 million dollar grant from [[Google]]. Using this grant, the Institute developed the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (or GD-IQ). The GD-IQ is an algorithm that can quickly scan a feature-length film to detect gender differences in representation. The Institute believes that the GD-IQ will significantly improve the Institute’s research of on-screen gender disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/movies/geena-davis-inclusion-quotient-research.html|title=How Long Is an Actress Onscreen?

In addition to its partnerships with several for-profit corporations, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has also partnered with a number of non-profit organizations in order to further the institute’s goal of generating equal representation for women in media. The institute has partnered with the [[United Nations]]; and founder Geena Davis is a chair on the California Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fccfoundation.org/press-release/academy-award-winning-actor-and-activist-geena-davis-to-speak-at-fund-for-women-and-girls-luncheon-april-9/|title=Academy Award-winning actor and activist Geena Davis to speak at Fund for Women and Girls luncheon April 9 - Fairfield County's Community Foundation|work=Fairfield County's Community Foundation|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant studies ==
The Institute has completed several large studies around the representation of gender in media. One larger study was conducted over gender roles in popular culture, including topics such as the disparity between speaking roles for men and women; and what type of roles men and women were shown as portraying on screen. The Institute conducted this research by analyzing several blockbuster films from [[2008 in film|2008]] and concluded that gender roles are stereotyped in popular culture. A second larger study was conducted over the impact that gender plays in both on screen media as well as behind the scenes of media production. The Geena Davis Institute investigated and discovered that in the film industry, only 8% of directors are women, coupled with 19% of producers and 13.6% of writers. Several other studies conducted by the institute concern additional issues regarding gender and media including gender disparity in media across several countries as well as the portrayal of gender in films specifically marketed to young girls and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/|title=Research Informs &amp; Empowers - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year, the institute studies female representation in entertainment and publishes their findings &lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"/&gt; Through this study, the institute hopes that bringing the facts about media representation to the public’s attention will bring positive change for female representation in the media. In 2015, the institute studied the top 100 grossing films of [[2014 in film|2014]] and [[2015 in film|2015]] and found that, overall, women spoke less than men and received less screen time in films. &lt;ref name="seejane.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/data/|title=Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient - See Jane|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study also found that “women had a particularly strong presence in the comedy and action genres,” and cites women like [[Tina Fey]] and [[Melissa McCarthy]] as a couple of the year’s leading ladies.&lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt; Yet even with female leads like Fey and McCarthy, out of the 100 films, only “11% featured a female lead.”&lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt;  Even though films featuring a female lead made up less than a quarter of the top 100 grossing films, “films led by women grossed 15.8% more on average than films led by men.” &lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt;

In 2016, the organization found that there were increasingly more female leads in movies than ever before. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/gender-equality-initiative-reframe/|title=Major Hollywood Execs Launch Campaign to End Gender Inequality|website=ScreenCrush|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;A separate study exemplifies the influence of female leads: after the release of films like [[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]] and [[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]], both of which feature female archers as leads, the number of young girls participating in archery greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/hitting-the-bullseye-reel-girl-archers-inspire-real-girl-archers-short.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, “68% of the film companies they’ve worked with have changed two or more of their projects” to include more female representation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelleking/2017/04/03/geena-davis-is-creating-opportunities-for-women-in-hollywood-by-tackling-gender-bias/4/#496be8474b71|title=Geena Davis Is Creating Opportunities For Women In Hollywood By Tackling Gender Bias|first=Michelle|last=King|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bentonville Film Festival ==
In addition to many of their research contributions, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media also created the Bentonville Film Festival. Davis founded the [[Bentonville Film Festival]] with Trevor Drinkwater. Films that are in the Bentonville film festival are guaranteed distribution, a move that Davis says will fix the disproportionate number of women creators in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/bentonville-film-festival-to-offer-more-diversity-in-2016-says-geena-davis-1201579283/|title=Bentonville Film Festival to Offer More Diversity in 2016, Says Geena Davis|last=Saval|first=Malina|date=2015-08-27|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yearly festival is held in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], Arkansas.Nearly 100 films are showcased at the growing festival.The festival also has concerts with various artists each year.

The '''George Town Festival''' is an annual cultural festival held within the city of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. The month-long art festival takes place every August throughout the city.

Inaugurated in 2010, the festival was initially mooted to celebrate the inscription of George Town as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/arts/international/george-town-festival-is-making-its-name-as-major-asian-arts-event.html|title=Old Colonial City in Malaysia Becomes a Stage|last=Chen|first=May Yee|date=31 July 2014|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since grown into a "''major Asian arts event''", attracting about 250,000 visitors in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=numbers /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Penang - Little Children on a Bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|The 2012 edition featured [[Ernest Zacharevic]]'s famous wall murals, which were drawn throughout [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], such as the '''Children on a Bicycle''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' at [[Armenian Street, George Town|Armenian Street]].&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;]]
In 2009, George Town World Heritage Incorporated, a state agency tasked with monitoring and promoting the city's heritage, had held a day-long festival to mark the inscription of the historical core of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in the previous year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penangmonthly.com/article.aspx?pageid=8080&amp;name=celebration_of_culture|title=Celebration of Culture|last=Rosalind Chua|first=|date=June 2010|website=Penang Monthly|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by the success of that event, a longer, month-long festival was mooted in 2010. Joe Sidek, a well known Malaysian artist, was roped in to manage the festival.&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;

In spite of budgetary constraints, the inaugural event was successfully held throughout the month of July in 2010.&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The art festival has been organised yearly since then, with events being held by utilising the city's heritage architecture as performance venues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 2014 edition drew in 218,355 visitors, a figure which rose to 250,000 in the following year.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt;

'''German Expressionism''' consisted of a number of related creative movements in Germany before the [[World War I|First World War]] that reached a peak in [[1920s Berlin|Berlin during the 1920s]]. These developments in Germany were part of a larger [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] movement in north and central European culture in fields such as [[architecture]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], as well as [[film|cinema]]. This article deals primarily with developments in German Expressionist cinema before and immediately after World War&amp;nbsp;I.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P047336, Berlin, Mary Wigman-Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Wigman]], pioneer of Expressionist dance (left)]]

===1910s–1930s===
[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Still from the 1920 film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'']]
Among the first Expressionist films, ''[[The Student of Prague (1913 film)|The Student of Prague]]''&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Roger Manvell |authorlink=Roger Manvell |title=Henrik Galeen - Films as writer:, Other films: |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ei-Gi/Galeen-Henrik.html |publisher=Film Reference |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1913), ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), ''[[From Morn to Midnight]]'' (1920), ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World]]''&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt; (1920), ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Destiny]]'' (1922), ''[[Nosferatu]]''&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt; (1922), ''[[Phantom (1922 film)|Phantom]]'' (1922), ''[[Schatten - Eine nächtliche Halluzination|Schatten]]'' (1923), and ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|The Last Laugh]]'' (1924) were highly symbolic and stylized.

The German Expressionist movement was initially confined to Germany due to the isolation the country experienced during World War I. In 1916, the government had banned foreign films. The demand from theaters to generate films led to an increase in domestic film production from 24 films in 1914 to 130 films in 1918. With inflation also on the rise, Germans were attending films more freely because they knew that their money's value was constantly diminishing.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Kristin 2010, p.87"&gt;Thompson, Kristin. Bordwell, David. ''Film History: An Introduction'', Third Edition. McGraw Hill. 2010, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the films' popularity within Germany, by 1922 the international audience had begun to appreciate German cinema, in part due to a decreasing anti-German sentiment following the end of World War I. By the time the 1916 ban on imports was lifted, Germany had become a part of the international film industry.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Kristin 2010, p.87"/&gt;

Various [[Europe|European cultures]] of the 1920s embraced an ethic of change and a willingness to look to the future by experimenting with bold, new ideas and artistic styles. The first Expressionist films made up for a lack of lavish budgets by using set designs with wildly non-realistic, geometrically absurd angles, along with designs painted on walls and floors to represent lights, shadows, and objects. The plots and stories of the Expressionist films often dealt with madness, [[insanity]], [[betrayal]] and other "[[intellectual]]" topics triggered by the experiences of World War I (as opposed to standard action-adventure and romantic films). Later films often categorized as part of the brief history of German Expressionism include ''[[Metropolis (1927 movie)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), both directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. This trend was a direct reaction against realism. Its practitioners used extreme distortions in expression to show an inner [[emotion]]al reality rather than what was on the surface.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Kristin 2010, p.91"&gt;Thompson, Kristin. Bordwell, David. ''Film History: An Introduction'', Third Edition. McGraw Hill. 2010, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme anti-realism of Expressionism was short-lived, fading away after only a few years. However, the themes of Expressionism were integrated into later films of the 1920s and 1930s, resulting in an artistic control over the placement of scenery, light, etc. to enhance the mood of a film. This dark, moody school of film making was brought to the United States when the [[Nazism|Nazis]] gained power and a number of German filmmakers emigrated to [[Hollywood]]. These German directors found U.S. movie studios willing to embrace them, and several German directors and cameramen flourished there, producing a repertoire of Hollywood films that had a profound effect on film as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Dickos, Andrew (2002). ''Street with No Name: A History of the Classic Film Noir''. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press. {{ISBN|0-8131-2243-0}}, pp. 9-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi film theorist [[Fritz Hippler]], though, was a supporter of expressionism. Two further films produced in Nazi Germany using the expressionist style were “''Das Stahltier''” (''The Animal of Steel'') in 1935 by Willy Zielke and “''[[Michelangelo]]. Das Leben eines Titanen''” (''Michelangelo. The Life of a Titan'') in 1940 by Curt Oertel.&lt;ref&gt;Michaela Rethmeier: Die Funktion und Bedeutung Fritz Hipplers für das Filmschaffen im „Dritten Reich“. Page 67 (dissertation, University of Münster, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two genres that were especially influenced by Expressionism are [[horror film]] and [[film noir]]. [[Carl Laemmle]] and [[Universal Studios]] had made a name for themselves by producing such famous [[horror film]]s of the silent era as [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. German filmmakers such as [[Karl Freund]] (the cinematographer for ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' in 1931) set the style and mood of the Universal [[monster movie]]s of the 1930s with their dark and artistically designed sets, providing a model for later generations of horror films. Directors such as [[Fritz Lang]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[Otto Preminger]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Carol Reed]] and [[Michael Curtiz]] introduced the Expressionist style to crime dramas of the 1940s, expanding Expressionism's influence on modern filmmaking.

==Influence and legacy==
The German silent cinema was arguably far ahead of Hollywood during the same period.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;"Paul Merton Looks at Alfred Hitchcock", BBC Television 2009, Broadcast- 28th Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The cinema outside Germany benefited both from the emigration of German film makers and from German expressionist developments in style and technique that were apparent on the screen. The new look and techniques impressed other contemporary film makers, artists and cinematographers, and they began to incorporate the new style into their work.

In 1924, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was sent by [[Gainsborough Pictures]] to work as an assistant director and art director at the UFA [[Babelsberg Studios]] in Berlin on the film ''[[The Blackguard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Paul Merton Looks at Alfred Hitchcock", BBC Television 2009, Broadcast- 28th Feb 2009 and Wikipedia [[Alfred Hitchcock]] page&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate effect of the working environment in Germany can be seen in his expressionistic set designs for that film.  Hitchcock later said, "I...acquired a strong German influence by working at the UFA studios [in] Berlin".&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;

German Expressionism would continue to influence Hitchcock throughout his career. In his third film, ''The Lodger'', Hitchcock introduced expressionist set designs, lighting techniques, and trick camera work  to the British public against the wishes of his studio.  His visual experimentation included the use of an image of a man walking across a glass floor shot from below, a concept representing someone pacing upstairs.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;  This influence continued through the highly successful movie ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1960, wherein [[Norman Bates]]' blurred image, seen through a shower curtain, is reminiscent of [[Nosferatu]] shown through his shadow. Hitchcock's film-making in turn influenced many other film makers, and so has been one of the vehicles that propelled the continued use of German expressionist techniques, albeit less frequently.

[[Werner Herzog]]'s 1979 film ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre|Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht]]'' was a tribute to [[F. W. Murnau]]'s 1922 film. The film uses expressionist techniques of highly symbolic acting and symbolic events to tell its story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Nosferatu: The Vampyre |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/nosferatu_the_vampyre/#synopsis |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |quote=Stark, symbolic cinematography and intensely stylized performances |accessdate=2009-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207151304/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/nosferatu_the_vampyre/#synopsis |archive-date=2009-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 film ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' used stark contrast, rigid movements, and fantastic elements.&lt;ref name="efilm"&gt;{{cite news | author=Don Kornits | url=http://efilmcritic.com/feature.php?feature=54 | title=Alex Proyas - Director, Dark City | publisher=eFilmCritic | date=1999-06-02 | accessdate=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visions"&gt;{{cite news | author=Rob Blackwelder | url=http://www.splicedonline.com/features/proyas.html | title=Vision of Strangers Dance in His Head|publisher=SPLICEDwire | date=1998-02-13 | accessdate=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistic elements taken from German Expressionism are common today in films that need not reference contemporary realism, such as [[science fiction films]] (for example, [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which was itself influenced by ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2015/04/13/blade-runner-vs-metropolis/ |author= |title=Blade Runner vs. Metropolis |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woody Allen]]'s 1991 film ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' is an homage to German Expressionist filmmakers Fritz Lang, [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] and F. W. Murnau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111423%7C0/Shadows-and-Fog.html|title=Shadows and Fog|last=Steffen|first=James|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies: Film Article|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambitious adaptations of the style are depicted throughout the contemporary filmography of director [[Tim Burton]]. His 1992 film ''[[Batman Returns]]'' is often cited as a modern attempt to capture the essence of German expressionism. The angular building designs and severe-looking city squares of [[Gotham City]] evoke the loom and menace present in Lang's ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. Burton's expressionistic influences are most apparent in the fairy-tale suburban landscape of ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''. The appearance of the titular Edward Scissorhands (not accidentally) reflects ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|Caligari]]''{{'}}s somnambulist servant. Burton casts unease in his candy-colored suburb, and the tension is visually unmasked through Edward and his Gothic castle, a last holdout from the past at the end of a suburban street. Burton subverts the Caligari nightmare with an inspired narrative, casting Edward, the outsider, as the hero, and the villagers as the villains.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Similarly, Dr. Caligari was the inspiration for the grotesque, bird-like appearance of the Penguin in Burton's 1992 film ''Batman Returns''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}   The familiar look of Caligari's main character can also be seen in the movie ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''. With the tight, black outfit, white make-up and darkened eyes, [[Brandon Lee]]'s character is a close relative to both Cesare, and to Burton's film ''Edward Scissorhands''.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Burton was also reportedly influenced by silent films and German Expressionism for his film adaptation of the musical ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', describing the musical as a "silent film with music".{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Cinema and architecture==
Many critics see a direct tie between cinema and architecture of the time, stating that the sets and scene artwork of Expressionist films often reveal buildings of sharp angles, great heights, and crowded environments, such as the frequently shown Tower of Babel in Fritz Lang's ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/art-house-an-introduction-to-german-expressionist-films-32845|title=An Introduction to German Expressionist Films - artnet News|date=2013-12-26|newspaper=artnet News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong elements of monumentalism and modernism appear throughout the canon of German Expressionism. An excellent example of this is ''Metropolis'', as evidenced by the enormous power plant and glimpses of the massive yet pristine "upper" city.

German Expressionist painters rejected the naturalistic depiction of objective reality, often portraying distorted figures, buildings, and landscapes in a disorienting manner that disregarded the conventions of perspective and proportion. This approach, combined with jagged, stylized shapes and harsh, unnatural colors, were used to convey subjective emotions.

A number of artists and craftsmen working in the Berlin theater brought the Expressionist visual style to the design of stage sets. This, in turn, had an eventual influence on films dealing with fantasy and horror.

The prime example is Robert Wiene's dream-like film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) which is universally recognized as an early classic of Expressionist cinema. Hermann Warm, the film's art director, worked with painters and stage designers Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig to create fantastic, nightmarish sets with twisted structures and landscapes with sharp-pointed forms and oblique, curving lines. Some of these designs were constructions, others were painted directly onto canvases.

German Expressionist films produced in the [[Weimar Republic]] immediately following the [[World War I|First World War]] not only encapsulate the sociopolitical contexts in which they were created, but also rework the intrinsically modern problems of self-reflexivity, spectacle and identity.

Following the esteemed critiques of [[Siegfried Kracauer]] and [[Lotte Eisner]], these films are now viewed as a kind of collective consciousness, so inherently tied are they to their social milieu. Briefly mentioned by [[J. P. Telotte]] in his analysis of German film, “German Expressionism: A Cinematic/ Cultural Problem”, expressionism focuses on the “power of spectacles”&lt;ref name="Telotte"&gt;Telotte, J.P. “German Expressionism: A Cinematic/ Cultural Problem” in Traditions in World Cinema. (ed. Badley, et al.), 2006, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and offers audiences “a kind of [[metonymy|metonymic]] image of their own situation”.&lt;ref name="Telotte" /&gt;

This film movement paralleled Expressionist painting and theater in rejecting realism. The creators in the Weimar Period sought to convey inner, subjective experience through external, objective means. Their films were characterized by highly stylized sets and acting; they used a new visual style which embodied high contrast and simple editing. The films were shot in studios where they could employ deliberately exaggerated and dramatic lighting and camera angles to emphasize some particular affect – fear, horror, pain. Aspects of Expressionist techniques were later adapted by such directors as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] and were incorporated into many American gangster and horror films.

Some of the major filmmakers of this time were F. W. Murnau, Erich Pommer, and Fritz Lang. The movement ended after the currency stabilized, making it cheaper to buy movies abroad. The UFA financially collapsed and German studios began to deal with Italian studios which led to their influence in style of horror and films noir. The American influence on the film industry would also lead some film makers to continue their career in the US. The UFA's last film was ''[[The Blue Angel|Der blaue Engel]]'' (1930), considered a masterpiece of German Expressionism.

==Interpretation==
Two works about the era are Lotte Eisner's ''The Haunted Screen'' and Sigfried Kracauer's ''From Caligari to Hitler''.&lt;ref&gt;Kracauer, Siegfried. “Ca bla bkah 
ligari.” From Caligari to Hitler. Princeton: Princeton U P, [1947] 2004. 61–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Kracauer examines German cinema from the Silent/Golden Era and eventually concludes that German films made prior to [[Hitler]]'s takeover and the rise of the [[Third Reich]] all hint at the inevitability of Nazi Germany. For Eisner, German Expressionist cinema is a visual manifestation of Romantic ideals. She closely examines staging, cinematography, acting, scenarios, and other cinematic elements in films by Pabst, Lubitsch, Lang (her obvious favorite), Riefenstahl, Harbou, and Murnau. More recent German Expressionist scholars examine historical elements of German Expressionism, such as inflation/economics, [[Universum Film AG|UFA]], Erich Pommer, Nordisk, and Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eisner |first1=Lotte |title=The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt |date=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520257901 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|1632 series|The Grantville Gazettes}}

'''''Grantville Gazette II''''' is the third collaborative anthology published in print set in the [[1632-verse]] [[shared universe]] in what is best regarded as a canonical sub-series of the popular [[alternate history]] that began with the February 2000 publication of the hardcover novel [[1632 (novel)|1632]] by author-historian [[Eric Flint]]. Baen Books and Flint decline the distinction, counting this book as the sixth published work. Overall it is also the third anthology in printed publication in the atypical series which consists of a mish-mash of main novels and anthologies produced under popular demand after publication of the initial novel which was written as a stand-alone work.

==="An Invisible War"===
:by Danita Ewing

"An Invisible War" is a short novel that was the first serialized piece of longer fiction that spanned this and the next Gazette in their e-published versions—though the whole (110 pages) was published in the hardcover release of ''Grantville Gazette II''. The tale set mostly in 1633 after Grantville has had time to settle-in and look beyond immediate survival issues. It deals with public health and integration and dissemination of medical knowledge efforts during the end of the Confederated Principalities of Europe and early United States of Europe period, for the various Mike Stearns-led administration's have been repeatedly reminded by {{nowrap|[[List of 1632 fictional characters#Nichols, James|Dr. James Nichols]]}} and [[List of 1632 fictional characters#Mailey, Melissa|Melissa Mailey]] how vulnerable populations are and were to diseases in the seventeenth century era—so the up-timers have been both strategically aware and taking steps from the outset within their capabilities and resources to mitigate any preventable health problems beginning in the novel [[1632 (novel)|1632]]. To add impetus and urgency, as time goes by in the experience of Grantville, some of the historical research conducted in the two libraries reveals that plague outbreaks occurred locally in OTL in diverse regions during 1632, 1634, and 1635 saw a large epidemic-size outbreak. Worse, the historical record might also indicate other outbreaks, which were poorly documented.

The story is one of Grantville's medical personnel meeting head-on with down-timer University practices, prejudices and a college curricula based in large part on the [[Classics]] and [[theology|Theological]] studies. The town establishes the Lahey Clinic hospital near the Grantville High School and establishes a local nurse training program in 1631–1632, and by the summer of 1633 has reached out to the faculty of the University of Jena, but the only spareable medical manpower to head up a college of medicine are... women!

[[Image:Expo Pink Floyd - gilmour effects rack.png|thumb|right|200px|Pink Floyd's effects]]
A '''guitar technician''' (or 'guitar tech') is a member of a music ensemble's [[road crew]] who maintains and sets up the musical equipment for one or more [[guitarist]]s. Depending on the type and size of band, the guitar tech may be responsible for stringing, tuning, and adjusting [[electric guitar]]s and [[acoustic guitar]]s, and maintaining and setting up [[guitar amplifier]]s and other related electronic equipment such as [[effect pedal]]s.

Once the guitar equipment has been set up onstage, the guitar tech does a soundcheck to ensure that the equipment is working well. If there are any problems, the guitar tech replaces or repairs the faulty components or equipment. Since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have basic guitar-playing skills, a musical "ear" for tuning, and a familiarity with the way guitars, amplifiers, and effect pedals are supposed to sound in the style of music of their band.  

Guitar techs learn their craft either "on the job", by working in a range of music, sound engineering, and instrument repair jobs; by completing a guitar repair program at a college or [[lutherie]] school; or from a combination of these two routes. The salaries and conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely, depending on whether a guitar tech is working for a minor or regional touring bar band or a major international touring act.

==Duties==
===Setting up and soundchecking===
[[Image:Billy-corgan-guitar-rig.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Photo of [[Billy Corgan]]'s guitar rig taken by his guitar tech during one of the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' live shows during their 200? tour.]]

The duties of a guitar technician depend on the type of band they are working for, and on a range of other factors such as the size and nature of the stage show and the length of the show. Guitar technicians who work for an acoustic band, such as a folk group or [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] ensemble may be responsible for setting up and stringing, and tuning a range of stringed, fretted instruments including acoustic guitars, [[dobro]]s, and mandolins. A guitar tech for a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, on the other hand, may focus mainly on electric guitars, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. A guitar tech may change the sequence of effects pedals or alter the settings on effects pedals during the show, to assist the guitarist in creating different tone colours or sounds. For example, a guitarist may ask the guitar tech to connect a [[chorus effect]] and [[reverb]] before a [[guitar solo]]. In an [[indie rock]] band, a guitar technician would likely configure the equipment to evoke through [[Musical tone|tone]] a modern yet historically evocative sound. In an acid rock band, a guitar tech might have to manipulate the controls on a [[ring modulator]] or a rotating [[Leslie speaker]] cabinet to create unusual sounds while the guitarist is performing.
[[Image:Trent Wagler Chris Howdyshell tune.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Acoustic guitars being tuned up backstage before a concert; note the tiny electronic tuner clipped to the headstock of the guitar on the left.]]

Once the guitars have been tuned with an [[electronic tuner]] and strummed to ensure that they are in tune, the guitar tech usually sets up the different guitars on guitar racks, ensures that the leather or nylon straps are properly connected, and that the patch cords are plugged in properly. During the show, the guitar tech hands instruments to the guitarist or guitarists according to the types of guitar that are required in the songs that they are playing. For example, a hard rock guitarist may use a "flying-V" guitar for a fast song, and then switch to an acoustic 12-string guitar for a soft ballad. The guitar tech retunes all of the instruments before they are used, because even if an instrument was perfectly in tune during the soundcheck, the heat from stage lights and the humidity from the stage conditions may render the instrument slightly out of tune. 

After each guitar is used, the guitar tech cleans the strings with a cloth and replaces the instrument on a rack. During the show, the tech stands ready to replace any guitars in case a string breaks or if there is an equipment malfunction. The guitar tech may hand fresh towels to the guitarist so that the guitarist can remove sweat from the hands and ensure that the guitarist has ready access to bottles of cool water or other wet [[beer|beverages]]&lt;!--Technically, this could be called an easter egg...but it is on the grey zone, because Beer is a beverage...also, it is fun...who said we can't have a little bit o' fun!  --&gt;. If a guitar technician is working for a guitarist who uses [[plectrum|pick]]s, the guitar tech may lay out a variety of picks on a guitar amplifier or tape the picks to the mic stands with double-sided tape, so that they are within easy reach. At the end of the show, the guitar tech disconnects all of the patch cords, cleans the instruments and puts them back into their cases.

===Maintenance and repair===
The guitar tech also might perform any of a variety of maintenance tasks, such as checking that the string height of the guitars is set properly, modifying ("dressing") the height and arc of the frets, adjusting [[Intonation (music)|the intonation of the instruments]], checking that tubes (valves) on [[tube amplifier]]s are working properly, and that cables are in good condition and free from crackles and hum caused by nicks and abrasions in the shielding or cable insulation. Techs also check the batteries on "outboard" devices — effects boxes, tuners, and pre-amps — and wireless transmitters, and change them as necessary. Depending on the size of a band's road crew, the guitar tech may either do this maintenance him- or herself, or, in a large touring act, delegate tasks to more-junior personnel.

The guitar tech does a basic soundcheck with the different guitars, amplifiers, and effects, to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly and that all of the connections between the equipment (which are made with [[patch cord]]s) are plugged in correctly. This may be as simple as plugging an electric guitar into an amplifier or plugging an acoustic guitar into a [[DI box]] and preamp/equalizer. On the other hand, a tech may have to set up ten or more electric guitars, a variety of amplifiers, and connect them to an intricate sequence of effects pedals.  

When all of the instruments and equipment are set up and [[soundcheck]]ed, if there are problems — crackles, hum, no signal from the guitar, no sound from an amplifier — the tech may have responsibility for [[troubleshooting]] to determine the cause or causes. Common problems include damaged patch cords, [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] in connection between instruments and amplifiers, weak batteries in effects boxes or on-board preamps, bad vacuum tubes in tube amplifiers or overdrive effects, broken electrical connectors or solder joints, speaker voice coils damaged from the previous concert, or equipment damaged during transport. Tuning problems may come from old or dirty strings, damaged or worn machine heads or frets, or mis-adjusted bridges.

A guitar tech is often a "jack of all trades," expected to make simple repairs: resolder a loose wiring connection inside a guitar, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, reglue a loose part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a [[truss rod]]. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is may be responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up an item, the tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.

On rare occasions, guitar technicians may be asked to fill in for the guitarist they are teching for.

==Conditions of work==
The conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely. Some guitar techs for small touring acts may set up guitars for all of the stringed-instrument performers—rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass, and so on; they may even take on a large variety of tasks beyond guitar tech work, such as helping to set up sound equipment or soundcheck the microphones. On the other hand, guitar techs for major touring bands may be part of a large road crew team that includes amplifier technicians, guitar technicians for each guitarist (rhythm guitarist and lead guitarist), and a variety of people who set up the stage equipment. In a major touring band, a guitar tech's duties might be more narrowly circumscribed. They might only have to set up the guitars for a single performer, and there might be other staff who set up and maintain the amplifiers, effects, and guitar stands, and electronics technicians who solder and repair connections and wiring.

The salary, benefits, and accommodations of guitar techs vary widely. The first jobs that a guitar tech does may be on a volunteer basis in a garage band or amateur group, to gain experience, or alternatively the guitar tech might work in return for a small cash payment that is more of a symbolic [[honorarium]] than a real salary. In regional-level bar bands or minor touring acts, the guitar techs may be paid on a contractual basis during the weeks or months that the group is on tour, and there may not be health or dental benefits. A guitar tech working for this type of band must find other work to fill in months when the band is not on tour. On the other hand, a major touring act may hire a guitar technician as a permanent employee and provide them with a range of benefits. 

Accommodations depend on conditions set out in the contract, and the level and status of the group. A guitar tech traveling with a regional-level band may stay in inexpensive motels and receive a modest per diem for restaurant meals. A guitar tech traveling with a major touring band, however, may stay at the same first-class hotels as the star performers and eat catered buffet or restaurant meals. Some bands with substantial road crews may have their own catering crew. Guitar techs for the most famous international guitarists such as [[Jimmy Page]] or [[Tony Iommi]] can become minor celebrities within the guitar fan community because of their proximity to famous musicians and insider knowledge of how a certain guitarist's unique tone is created.

==Training and career path==
Guitar technicians must have a broad knowledge of the musical equipment used in the types of bands they work with. At a minimum, this must consist of familiarity with setting up and tuning guitars and making simple adjustments and repairs. As well, guitar techs are often expected to set up, repair, and adjust electronic effects, tuners, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, and pedalboards. To do these tasks, guitar techs must know about a range of audio engineering and electronics concepts—such as [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], signal phase (for speakers and microphone wiring), and input voltage for pre-amps and effects. To do simple repairs on electronic gear, a guitar tech may have to know how to use a soldering iron and a [[multitester]], and how to do basic electronics troubleshooting.

As well, since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have a knowledge of the way guitars and amplifiers are supposed to sound in the style of music of the band. This means that the guitar tech must have an ear for music, and for musical tones and sounds. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band must be able to tell whether distortion from a heavily over-driven tube amp is desirable tube clipping or distortion from a blown speaker or damaged power amp. The distinctions a guitar tech must make can be subtle. For example, a guitar tech replacing a blown tube with a new one may have to ensure that the tube amplifier still has the same "color" or "warmth" when chords are played through it.

To check guitar tuning, a guitar tech must be able to play major, minor, and other chords in a variety of keys. Even if the guitar has been tuned with an electronic tuner, the tuning still must be checked by ear, because the [[Equal temperament|equal tempered tuning]] of a guitar can involve compromise. Guitar tuning can be affected by fret placement and wear, the angle of bridge angle, string age, and other factors. Thus, even if an electronic tuner indicates that a guitar is 100% "in tune," it may still need minor adjustments which are made by ear. 

The training of guitar technicians varies widely. Some guitar technicians have studied music, guitar repair, amplifier maintenance, or electronics repair in college or university. On the other hand, some techs learned these skills informally on the job, or by working their way up through the ranks in a range of musical jobs, from a [[roadie]] and [[sound engineer]] to a [[sideman]] in a bar band. Guitar techs trained on the job may learn their skills by playing in amateur or semi-professional bands as a guitarist or bassist, working for music stores as a guitar repairperson, for clubs or bars as a sound engineer, or by maintaining equipment for [[PA system]] rental companies.  

A typical career path for becoming a guitar technician via on the job training is to begin by volunteering in a bar band and then working for low wages in a regional touring act or a minor touring act. As they gain experience and add skills, they may seek out better-paying jobs with higher-status touring bands. Once a guitar technician has joined the road crew of a major touring act, they may seek out promotions within this organization, to jobs with greater responsibilities and higher pay. For example, a guitar tech who works as an assistant technician could try to get promoted to a guitar technician for the lead guitarist. A guitar tech who completes a guitar repair program at a college or [[lutherie]] school may be able to enter midway up the guitar tech career ladder.

In the early part of a guitar tech's career, there might be a great deal of mobility between different types of bands and technician roles. While working for minor or regional acts, a guitar tech may be able to work for a country rock bar band and then immediately switch to being the bass tech for a hard rock [[tribute band]], because the tasks are fairly uniform. Career mobility of guitar technicians tends to become more constrained, though, when guitar techs begin to get jobs with high-status professional touring acts from specific genres. When a regional bar band looks for a guitar tech for a summer nightclub tour, there may many guitar techs who could meet the skill requirements. However, if an internationally-known 1960s-style acid rock touring act with a celebrity lead guitarist goes on a major tour, there may be only a handful of guitar techs who have the unique combination of skills for this position.&lt;ref&gt;(E.g., professional lutherie training on how to repair vintage 1960s-era guitars and effects, familiarity with repairing and maintaining 1960s-era rotating Leslie speaker cabinets—and
familiarity with what is, for many, a more obscure music genre).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bass guitar technician==
[[Bass guitar]] technicians (or "bass techs") perform the same functions for a bass guitar player. The bass guitar is a variety of electric guitar pitched below a regular electric guitar, typically by one octave. Many basic elements of the two types of instruments are similar enough—magnetic pickups routed to an electronic amplifier—that a guitar technician is usually able to work as a bass guitar technician if they become familiar with the unique aspects of the electric bass. The electric bass differs from the electric guitar in several respects. To become a bass tech, a person must learn how to set up the string action (height) and adjust the height of the pickups so that the bassist is able to create the tones associated with different bass styles. Depending on the band, these styles might include such as [[slap and pop]], [[tapping]], or [[upright bass]]-style playing with the thumb. 

As with guitar techs, a bass tech also sets up the amplification equipment and effects pedals. Due to the lower pitch of the bass guitar, this instrument is amplified with specialized [[bass instrument amplifier]]s. While bass guitarists do not usually use as many effects pedals as most guitarists (e.g., reverb, chorus, flanger, etc.), most professional bassists may use a few "sound conditioner" effects such as a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]], [[limiter]], or [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]]. Some bassists also use octave pedals to generate extremely low pitches or bass overdrive pedals that produce a fuzzy, distorted sound. Although these effects function in the same way as regular electric guitar effects, a bass tech must be familiar with the settings and the resulting sounds and tones that are most often used by bass guitarists. A guitar tech who is in the first stages of learning to become a bass tech may know how to set up the bass effects from a technical point of view, but it may take a little longer for them to learn which compressor settings, for example, are associated with different funk or metal styles.

In some country, [[rockabilly]], or jazz bands, the bass tech might also be responsible for setting up, tuning, and maintaining an [[upright bass]] or [[electric upright bass]]. In some folk or acoustic bands, the bass technician may also be responsible for maintaining an [[acoustic bass guitar]], which is a larger, bass version of a standard [[acoustic guitar]]. More rarely, some bass techs might have to set up a [[bass synth]] (e.g., as used by the bassists in some alternative bands) or bass [[pedal keyboard]] such as a [[Moog Taurus]] pedal, as used by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] or [[Led Zeppelin]]. Both upright basses and acoustic bass guitars usually use piezoelectric pickups rather than magnetic pickups, and in some cases, the instruments may use condenser mics to pick up the higher range sounds. To amplify instruments with piezo transducers and condenser mics, specialized impedance-matching preamplifiers are often required. Also, since both piezoelectric transducers and microphones are more prone to unwanted feedback than magnetic pickups, the bass tech may have to set up a [[notch filter]] with a [[parametric equalizer]] to reduce the frequency that is feeding back.

[[File:Hans-Joachim Bohlmann.jpg|thumb|Hans-Joachim Bohlmann in 2000.]]
'''Hans-Joachim Bohlmann''' (20 September 1937  –  19 January 2009) was a German serial [[Vandalism of art|vandal]] who primarily targeted artworks at public exhibitions. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about 138 million euro) by such artists as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref name=sp2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42008774.html Ich bin mein eigener Sklave] Spiegel, 1 October 2005 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bohlmann was born in [[Breslau]] (modern Wrocław).

Since his youth, Bohlmann suffered from a serious [[personality disorder]]. At the age of 16, he voluntarily went to the psychiatric clinic of the [[University of Kiel]] and underwent [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock]] and [[insulin]] treatments. Around that time, he was a plumber apprentice, but could not focus on a single occupation and was doing various jobs. He had several therapy courses involving [[Sedative|tranquilizers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[antipsychotic]] drugs, [[behavior therapy]] and [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]], but with very limited success.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

In 1968, Bohlmann married and worked for six years at a warehouse. He then frequently took [[valium]] and [[haloperidol]] and regularly attended church masses. In 1974, he met the neurosurgeon Dieter Müller from the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf]] who suggested a [[lobotomy]] treatment. Although Müller predicted a 75–80% chance of success, the operation brought no improvement. It was later criticized as obsolete and merely reduced Bohlmann's intelligence. On 11 March 1977, his wife fell from a window while cleaning and died from injuries soon after. According to Bohlmann, the death of his wife turned him to vandalism. Previously, he often visited museums with his wife and saw the importance of art in society. He then started to buy [[sulfuric acid]] at pharmacies and spray it on paintings.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

His vandalism began on 16 March 1977 in a city park and followed on 29 March 1977 in [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]], where he damaged the painting ''Golden Fish'' by [[Paul Klee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artchive.com/artchive/K/klee/goldfish.jpg.html Klee: The Goldfish]. Artchive.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by other attacks in [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Essen]], [[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]], [[Bochum]], [[Kassel]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Hamelin]]. On 16 August 1977, he poured sulfuric acid on several artworks including portraits of Martin Luther and his wife Katharina von Bora by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the [[Lower Saxony State Museum]] of Hanover. On 24 August 1977, he damaged the painting ''Archduke Albrecht'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/sir-peter-paul-rubens-and-studio-siegen-1577-16-1-c-vcdsddiqxk Lot 89: Sir Peter Paul Rubens and Studio Siegen 1577 – 1640 Antwerp]. Invaluable.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; in Düsseldorf and on 7 October 1977 four paintings in [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in Kassel, estimated at more than 25 million euros, among them Rembrandt's [[:File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 062.jpg|''Jacob blessing Joseph's second son, 1656'']], a self-portrait by Rembrandt and [[Willem Drost]]'s ''Noli me tangere''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php?parent=2244 30 Jahre nach Säureattentat: Willem Drosts "Noli me tangere" erstrahlt in neuem Glanz (30 years after acid attack: Willem Drosts' "Noli me tangere" shines in new splendor)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064922/http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php?parent=2244 |date=19 July 2011 }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In his attacks, Bohlmann was primarily targeting the faces of the personages, trying to inflict maximum damage. Bohlmann's activity was not restricted to paintings and museums; he ignited an altar in Lübeck and sprayed hundreds of tombstones with swastikas at night in Hamburg. The resultant outrage in the press encouraged him. As he felt he was becoming a celebrity, he abandoned the antidepressant drugs he had been taking.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

Bohlmann was arrested in October 1977 and in 1979 convicted by the Hamburg Regional Court to five years in prison for 17 cases of damage to public property, 3 cases of damage to private property and one case of cruelty to animals. He served the term in full until 6 October 1982.&lt;ref name=sp1&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,147904,00.html "Dürer-Attentäter" auf der Flucht] Spiegel, 31 July 2001 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; After release from prison, Bohlmann resumed vandalism. He was then banned from buying acid and instead committed arson at a construction site near Hamburg inflicting damage estimated at 65,000 euros. For this crime, the Hamburg Regional Court sentenced him to three years ending on 5 May 1986. A part of his pension was seized for the damage done to Ruben's ''Archduke Albrecht'', and in the autumn of 1987 he went for treatment in the psychiatric department of the Hospital Hamburg-[[Eilbek]].&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

In March 1988, Bohlmann bought two litres of sulfuric acid and hid them in a park. On 20 April 1988, he took a leave from the hospital and the next day splashed acid on three paintings by Albrecht Dürer in Munich's [[Alte Pinakothek]], namely [[Lamentation of Christ (Dürer, Munich)|''Lamentation for Christ'']], [[Paumgartner altarpiece|''Paumgartner Altar'']] and [[:File:Albrecht Dürer 025.jpg|''Mater Dolarosa'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xKyeh1_V7IC&amp;pg=PA283|page=283|title=Albrecht Dürer: a guide to research|author=Jane Campbell Hutchison|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-8153-2114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflicting damage estimated at 35 million euros. Immediately after the attacks, he was arrested and held in the psychiatric hospital of [[Haar, Bavaria]]. In 1989 he was convicted by the Munich District Court to a two-year imprisonment, concurrent with treatment as long as necessary in a psychiatric hospital, and in March 1990 transferred to the clinic in Hamburg-Ochsenzoll. Bohlmann escaped from the facility in January 1998 and after being at large for two days he was found at a subway station, possibly on the way back to the hospital. On 30 July 2001 he escaped again but returned to hospital the next morning.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sp1/&gt;

In Ochsenzoll he attended art therapy and for nine years painted pictures, almost every day, with a total number of about 1,500. In January 2005, more than 16 years after his arrest in Munich, Bohlmann was released to public life. On 25 June 2006, in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, he splashed lighter fuel on the painting ''[[:File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster.jpg|Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster]]'' (1648) by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]] and set fire to it. Most damage was to the varnish layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nieuwsenagenda/vanderhelst?lang=en Van der Helst painting vandalised in Rijksmuseum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311023730/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nieuwsenagenda/vanderhelst?lang=en |date=11 March 2007 }} News item [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]], retrieved 30-aug-09&lt;/ref&gt; Bohlmann was sentenced to 3 years by the court in Amsterdam. After serving two-thirds of the sentence, on 24 June 2008 he was released from prison, returned to Hamburg and died there on 19 January 2009 of cancer.

'''Herman Charles Merivale''' [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] (27 January 1839 – 17 August 1906)  was an English dramatist and poet, son of [[Herman Merivale]].  He also used the [[pun]]ning [[pseudonym]] '''Felix Dale'''.

==Life==
A [[barrister]], writer, and [[civil servant]] who was Permanent Under-Secretary of the [[India Office]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detailp.cfm?NID=57073&amp;EID=22723&amp;DID=&amp;AID= University of Glasgow library catalogue site]&lt;/ref&gt; he was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Charles Bowen, Baron Bowen|Charles Bowen]] were his contemporaries. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1861. At his father's home he met many distinguished men, including Lord Robert Cecil (afterwards [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]), who became a lifelong friend. His friends in literary and dramatic circles included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Edmund Yates]], [[Charles Dickens]] and others.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Elizabeth Lee, ‘Merivale, Herman Charles (1839–1906)’, rev. William Baker, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Following his father's death in 1874 he gave up the law in favour of literature and the theatre. Merivale wrote many farces and burlesques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=George |last=Wilman |title=Sketches of living celebrities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA106 |year=1882 |publisher=Griffith and Farran |location=London |pages=106&amp;ndash;109 |chapter=Herman Charles Merivale}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Hollingshead]] he produced a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], ''The Lady of Lyons Married and Settled'', performed at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] (5 October 1878), and ''Called There and Back'' (15 October 1884). ''The Butler'' (1886) and ''The Don'' (1888) were both written for the actor [[J. L. Toole]]. In writing ''The Don'', and other works, Merivale was assisted by his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Pittman, whom he married in London on 13 May 1878.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

A few years before his death Merivale became a [[Roman Catholic]]. He died suddenly of heart failure on 14 January 1906 at 69 Woodstock Road, [[Acton, London|Acton]], [[Middlesex]],&lt;ref&gt;The Times Obituary 17 January 1906&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in his father's grave in [[Brompton Cemetery]]. He had no children and his widow was granted a civil-list pension of £50 in 1906.

'''Jack Epps Jr.''' (born 1949) is an American [[screenwriter]], [[author]] and [[educator]], known chiefly for such popular 1980s films as ''[[Top Gun]]'',&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Epps Jr.|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258390/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'', which he wrote with longtime partner [[Jim Cash]]. Epps Jr. graduated from the College of Arts and Letters at [[Michigan State University]], and has since gone on to teach at [[the University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="Cinema USC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Epps Jr.|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/directories/profile.cfm?id=6498&amp;first=&amp;last=&amp;title=&amp;did=67&amp;referer=%..|publisher=Cinema USC|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Epps Jr. came to California to become a director, but he did not have the money or know-how to do so. He decided to first write a script and to hope that this would lead to directing. Partnering with Anderson House, they sold a script to ''Hawaii Five-O''. He continued to work with House for a few years, before partnering with Jim Cash.&lt;ref name="Old School Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the 80s: Interview with Jack Epps Jr. screenwriter of Top Gun &amp; more - Kickin' it Old School|url=http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1970118087|publisher=Old School Blog|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Gun'' and later successes===
After completing seven unproduced screenplays together, Epps Jr. and Cash produced ''Top Gun''. This film went on to become the number-one worldwide box office hit in 1986. After this, they quickly wrote other screenplays that were produced, including ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of my Success]]''. Epps co-authored over 25 screenplays and eight motion pictures that he produced well into the following decade, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' and ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]''.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie"&gt;{{cite web|title=JACK EPPS JR.|url=http://angelsintheskythemovie.com/the-talent-team/8-bios/14-jack-epps-jr|publisher=Angels in the Sky Movie|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for some of the most successful actors in the industry including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Warren Beatty]] and others.

==Teaching==
Epps Jr. is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Writing for Screen and Television Division in the School of Cinematic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jack-epps-jr&lt;/ref&gt; Using techniques he had developed over his career and applied to classes, he authored a screenwriting manual, ''Screenwriting is Rewriting: The Art and Craft of Professional Revision'', in 2016.

==Awards and honors==
Epps Jr. was awarded on honorary doctorate of fine arts by Michigan State University at their 2009 commencement. He is also the recipient of the Michigan State University Spartans in Hollywood Award.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie" /&gt; He is part of the Writer's Guild of America where he has been a member for three decades and he is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

'''''Jasper Jones''''' is an  Australian [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Rachel Perkins]]. The film was released in 2017 and is based on the [[Jasper Jones|novel of the same name]] by [[Craig Silvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2015/09/28/article/Toni-Collette-joins-Jasper-Jones-cast/JPPHBXZIZY.html|title=Toni Collette joins Jasper Jones cast|publisher=If.com.au|date=28 September 2015|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Protagonist Charlie Bucktin is a 14-year-old boy living in the fictitious rural town of Corrigan in [[Western Australia]]. Charlie spends his days with his best friend Jeffrey Lu, a Vietnamese boy who shares Charlie's love of intellectual banter, and deals stoically with the constant race-hate inflicted on him and his family. Eliza Wishart, a local girl, and daughter of the President of the town hall becomes more and more endeared towards Charlie.

On Christmas evening Charlie is unexpectedly visited by Jasper Jones, an outcast in Corrigan due to his mixed White-Aboriginal heritage and rebellious lifestyle. Jasper begs for Charlie's help, and leads him to his private glade in the bush. Here Charlie is horrified to find the dead body of a young girl, Jasper's girlfriend Laura Wishart, battered and hanging from a tree. Jasper, aware that he is likely to be blamed for Laura's murder, convinces Charlie that they should hide the body, so they throw it into a nearby pond, weighted by a large rock.

Jeffrey is passionate about cricket, but his attempts to join the Corrigan team are thwarted by the racism of the coach and other players. Eventually fortune goes his way, and he finds himself batting in a game against a rival town, watched by Charlie, who has befriended Eliza, Laura Wishart's younger sister. As Jeffrey wins the game on the last ball, Charlie and Eliza hold hands and embrace.

A search for the missing girl is soon organized, focused on the idea that she may have run away. Jasper is interrogated roughly by the local police, but he soon escapes. Meanwhile tension builds in the town, as parents fear more disappearances, and townspeople search for someone to blame. The tension is funneled into strict curfews for the children as well as racial attacks on Jeffrey's family. It is revealed that Charlie's mother, increasingly disillusioned with life in Corrigan and her marriage, is having an affair with the Sarge involved with the investigation into Laura's disappearance. 

Jasper believes that Laura's murderer is Mad Jack Lionel, a reclusive old man who is rumored to have done terrible things in the past.  Jasper determines to confront Lionel on New Year's Eve, and together with Charlie, goes to his house. Lionel manages to defuse Jasper's aggression, and the truth comes out: Lionel is actually Jasper's grandfather who had ostracized his son's family knowing that he had married with an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] woman when Jasper was a baby. His daughter-in-law then took care of him, spurring a change of heart towards her. One night, she needed medical attention, and Lionel had attempted to race her to hospital. In his haste, however, he accidentally crashed his car, causing her death. The incident has left him guilty, broken, and ostracized by the townspeople. Ever since, Lionel has been trying to reach out to Jasper and apologize for his actions.

On the same night, Charlie comes to Eliza's window. They go to Jasper's glade. Here Eliza tells Charlie that she knows everything about Laura's death and hands him the suicide note detailing the gruesome reasons for her apparent suicide. The note said that after rampant sexual abuse by her abusive father, leaving Laura pregnant, and after a particularly violent fight on Christmas day, Laura came looking for Jasper. Eliza followed her to the glade. Finding Jasper away, in despair Laura hanged herself, and Eliza, paralyzed by fear, could not save her. Charlie then confesses that he and Jasper had thrown Laura's body into the pond.  The next day Charlie and Eliza take the note to Eliza's mother. She quietly reads the note then tears it repeatedly, eventually soaking the tiny scraps in her cup of tea without saying a word. The look on her face makes clear that she knew about the abuse and even now has no intention of addressing it. Eliza harshly insists that Charlie leave the house.  He passes her father in the yard and then makes his way to the police station to report what he knows. His attempt is interrupted by news that the Wishart house is on fire and everyone runs to the scene.

Charlie's mother leaves Corrigan. Charlie remains close to Eliza, who exacts revenge on her father by setting fire to their house, injuring him. The secret about Laura's death remains with the three of them.

==Reception==
''Jasper Jones'' received positive reviews from critics and audiences, earning a 74% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

C.J. Johnson of ABC Radio gave a positive review, calling the film "engrossing, surprising and moving, and obviously made with great care and love." Sarah Ward of Playground also gave a positive review, commenting "There's always room for a smart, thoughtful and engaging take on a well-worn premise, and ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]]'' director [[Rachel Perkins]] delivers just that" Alex Doenau of Trespass described the film as "well scripted, shot, and acted, there's very little not to recommend it."

Jim Schembri of 3AW gave a negative review, describing the story as "pitted with plotholes of implausibility that continually take you out of the picture, robbing the film almost entirely of tension." Jake Wilson of The Age gave a mixed review, writing "It's hard to say if there is a centre to a narrative that jumps from one subplot to another in the manner of a soap opera."

The '''[[lion]]''' is a common [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]. It traditionally symbolises [[courage]], [[nobility]], [[Royal family|royalty]], strength, stateliness and [[valour]], because historically it has been regarded as the "king of beasts".&lt;ref name="Garai73"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn = 0-671-21773-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lion refers also to a [[Judeo-Christian]] symbolism. The [[Lion of Judah]] stands in the [[Emblem of Jerusalem|coat of arms of Jerusalem]]. Similar looking lion can be found e.g. in the coat of arms of the Swedish royal [[House of Bjelbo]], from there in turn derived into the [[coat of arms of Finland]], formerly belonging to Sweden, and many others examples for similar historical reasons.

The animal designs in the [[heraldry]] of the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval period]] are a continuation of the [[animal style]] of the [[Viking Age]], ultimately derived from the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confronted animals|Symmetrically paired animals]] in particular find continuation from  [[Migration Period art]] via [[Insular art]] to [[Romanesque art]] and heraldry.

The animals of the "barbarian" ([[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian]]) predecessors of heraldic designs are likely to have been used as [[totemism|clan symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"They [animal style designs] have also been explained as totems venerated by the various clans of nomads as ancestors. Their transformation into clan symbols would have followed naturally and easily. The heraldic beasts of medieval chivalry, which include many deer and felines like those on the British royal coat of arms, may certainly be traces back to emblematic devices of later barbarian tribes from central Asia" Hugh Honour, John Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (2005), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT166  p. 166].&lt;/ref&gt;
Adopted in [[Germanic art|Germanic tradition]] around the [[Germanic Iron Age|5th century]],&lt;ref&gt;
Danuta Shanzer, Ralph W Mathisen, ''Romans, Barbarians, and the Transformation of the Roman World: Cultural Interaction and the Creation of Identity in Late Antiquity'',  (2013) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=1jNRbpoQOscC&amp;pg=PA322  p. 322].&lt;/ref&gt; they were re-interpreted in a  [[Germanic Christianity|Christian context]] in the western kingdoms of [[Francia|Gaul]] and [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Italy]] in the 6th and 7th centuries.  The characteristic of the lion as royal animal in particular is due the influence of [[the Physiologus]], an early Christian book about animal symbolism, originally written in Greek in the 2nd century and translated into Latin in about AD 400. 
It was a predecessor of the medieval [[bestiaries]].

The lion as a heraldic charge is present from the very earliest development of [[heraldry]] in the 12th century. One of the earliest known examples of armory as it subsequently came to be practiced can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated six golden lions rampant and wearing a blue helmet adorned with another lion. A  chronicle dated to c. 1175 states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier heraldic writers attributed the [[coat of arms of England|lions of England]] to [[William the Conqueror]], but the earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the lions of the [[List of coats of arms of the House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] (England and Normandy) coat of arms, 12th-century examples of lions used as heraldic charges include the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen (Hohenstaufen)]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] ([[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]) coats of arms, both 
deriving from  [[Henry the Lion]],  the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]], attributed to [[William the Lion]],&lt;ref&gt;Hopingius, ''De Insigniis'' (1642) claimed that the use of the red lion as an emblem goes back to the [[Picts]]; cited in {{cite book|title=A System of Heraldry|author=Alexander Nisbet|volume=1|page=265|url=https://archive.org/stream/systemofheraldry01nisbuoft#page/266/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the [[coat of arms of Denmark]], first used by [[Canute VI of Denmark|Canute VI]], the [[coat of arms of Flanders]] ([[Duchy of Jülich|Jülich]]), first used by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip I]], the [[coat of arms of León]], an example of [[canting arms]]&lt;ref&gt;The actual etymology of ''[[Kingdom of León|León]] is ''[[Roman legion|Legion (Λεγίων)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Alfonso VII]] (1126), and the [[coat of arms of Bohemia]], first granted to [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus II]].

Coats of arms of the 13th century include those of the [[House of Sverre]] ([[coat of arms of Norway]]), the [[Ludovingians]] (the [[coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]] used by [[Conrad of Thuringia]]), [[Henry V of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], the [[kingdom of Ruthenia]] ([[Coat of arms of Lviv|Volhynia]]), the [[House of Habsburg]] (the Habsburgs all but abandoned their original coat of arms after gaining the [[Duchy of Austria]] in the 1270s, but it remained in use in derived lineages such as the [[House of Kyburg]]), the [[Coat of arms of Bulgaria|kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] ([[Rubenids]]).

Unlike the [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]], which is comparatively rare in heraldry because it was reserved as an [[Reichsadler|imperial symbol]], the lion became a symbol of [[chivalry]] and was not restricted to royal coats of arms. The [[Zürich armorial]] (14th century) has a number of coats of arms with lions, most of them of [[ministeriales]] of the House of Habsburg.

The lion in the [[coat of arms of Bohemia]] is depicted with two tails (''à la queue fourchée''). 
According to [[Claude-François Ménestrier|Ménestrier]], this is due to a jest made by  [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick]], who granted  [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia]] a coat of arms with a lion ''coué'', that is, with its tail between its legs. Vladislaus' men refused to follow this emblem, calling it an ape, so that Frederick agreed to [[Augmentation of honour|improve]] the arms by giving the lion not just one but two erect tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A System of Heraldry|author=Alexander Nisbet|volume=1|page=290|url=https://archive.org/stream/systemofheraldry01nisbuoft#page/290/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes==
As many ''[[attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]]'' (positions) now exist in heraldry as the heraldist's imagination can conjure, as a result of the ever-increasing need for differentiation, but very few of these were apparently known to medieval heralds.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies172&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; One distinction commonly made (especially among French heralds), although it may be of limited importance, is the distinction of lions in the walking positions as ''[[leopard (heraldry)|leopards]]''.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies172 /&gt; The following table summarizes the principal attitudes of heraldic lions:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Attitude

! Description
|-
|''Rampant''
| &lt;center&gt;[[File:Lion Rampant.svg|100px]]&lt;/center&gt;
| A "lion rampant" is depicted in profile standing erect with forepaws raised.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the hind legs varies according to local custom: the lion may stand on both hind legs, braced wide apart, or on only one, with the other also raised to strike; the word ''rampant'' is often omitted, especially in early blazon, as this is the most usual position of a carnivorous quadruped;
''Note:'' the term ''segreant'' denotes the same position, but is only used in reference to winged four-legged beasts like [[griffin]]s and [[European dragon|dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other terms are used to describe the lion's position in further detail. Each coat of arms has a right and left (i.e. ''dexter'' and ''sinister'') side - ''with respect to the person carrying the shield'' - so the left side of the shield as drawn on the page (thus the right side to the shield bearer) is called the dexter side. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, facing dexter (left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's ''whole body'' is turned to face right, he is ''to sinister'' or ''contourné''. If his ''whole body'' faces the viewer, he is ''affronté''. If his ''head only'' faces the viewer he is ''guardant'' or ''gardant'', and if he looks back over his shoulder he is ''regardant''. These adjectives follow any other adjectives of position.

A lion (or other beast) ''coward'' carries the tail between its hind legs.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tail also may be knotted (''nowed''), forked (''queue fourchée''), doubled (''double-queued''; as in the arms of the kingdom of Bohemia), or cut off (''defamed'').

Both lions and leopards may have been among the earliest beasts to appear in heraldry. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'' notes that the earliest English treatise on heraldry, a late-13th or early-14th century [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] manuscript titled ''De Heraudrie'',&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock &amp; Robinson (1988), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the crow, eagle, griffin, heron, leopard, lion, martlet, popinjay, and swan.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock &amp; Robinson (1988), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Bado Aureo, the ''Oxford Guide'' further suggests that the leopard, said to be "borne of an adulterous union between a lioness and a [[pard (legendary creature)|pard]]," and like a [[mule]] incapable of reproducing, may be an appropriate charge for a person born of adultery or barred from reproducing (such as an [[abbot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock &amp; Robinson (1988), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, English heralds tend to identify ''lions'' as rampant (upright, in profile facing dexter), and ''leopards'' as passant guardant (walking, head turned to full face), but the heraldic distinction between lions and leopards is often ambiguous and in some cases may be controversial (as in the case of the [[royal arms of England]], discussed below). Part of the confusion arises from international differences in translation or in the defining characteristics of each, particularly in charges that show some characteristics of each.

English herald [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] asserted in 1909 that the ''leopard'', denoting a lion passant guardant, was a term of French origin that had "long since become obsolete in English armory. In French blazon, however, the old distinction is still observed." Fox-Davies continued, "[French heralds] term our lion passant a ''léopard-lionné'' and our lion rampant guardant is their ''lion-léopardé''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=Arthur Charles |year=1909 |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dutch heraldist [[Johannes Rietstap]], however, defined a ''Léopard lionné'' as a lion rampant guardant (i.e., upright like a lion with its head turned to full face like a leopard) and a ''Lion léopardé'' as a lion passant (i.e., walking like a leopard with its head facing dexter like a lion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rietstap |first=Johannes |year=1884 |title=Armorial Général |page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt; German-American heraldist [[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]] agrees with Rietstap's translations, in contrast to those of Fox-Davies as stated above.&lt;ref&gt;Volborth (1983), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

As if to clarify the situation, English heraldist Hugh Clark wrote in his ''Introduction to Heraldry'' (1829):
{{quote|The true heraldic lion, according to French authors, is always to be represented in profile, or, as the ancient heralds say, showing but one eye and one ear. His attitude, also, should always be rampant or ravaging. When passant and full-faced, they blazoned him a leopard, ''vide Lion Leopardé'': in England, however, the lions in the royal and other achievements have always been blazoned as lions, however depicted since the time of Henry III, in whose reign they were called "Leopards".

Lion Leopardé ... is a French term for what the English call a ''Lion passant gardant''. The word ''leopard'' is always made use of by the French heralds to express in their language, a lion full-faced, or ''gardant''. Thus, when a lion is placed on an escutcheon in that attitude which we call ''rampant gardant'', the French blazon it a ''Lion Leopardé''. When he is passant only, they call him ''leopard lioné''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Hugh |author2=J. R. Planché  |year=1866 |title=An Introduction to Heraldry |edition=18th |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

English heraldist Charles Boutell wrote in 1890 that the lions of England were generally termed ''leopards'' until the end of the 14th century, including in the roll of arms of [[Henry III of England]], and in a statute of [[Edward I of England]], dating to 1300, which made reference to "''signée de une teste de leopart''—marked with the King's lion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1978 |origyear=1890 |title=Boutell's Heraldry |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''English Heraldry'' (1867), Boutell explained:

{{quote|Only when he was in this rampant attitude did the early Heralds consider any Lion to be a Lion, and blazon him by his true name. A lion walking and looking about him, the early Heralds held to be acting the part of a leopard: consequently, when he was in any such attitude, they blazoned him as "a leopard". The animal bearing that name bore it simply as an heraldic title, which distinguished a Lion in a particular attitude. These heraldic "leopards" were drawn in every respect as other heraldic "lions", without spots or any leopardish distinction whatever. This explains the usage, retained until late in the 14th century, which assigned to the Lions of the Royal Shield of England the name of "leopards". They were so called, not by the enemies of England for derision and insult, as some persons, in their ignorance of early Heraldry, have been pleased both to imagine and to assert; but the English Kings and Princes, who well knew their "Lions" to be Lions, in blazon styled them "leopards", because they also knew that Lions in the attitude of their "Lions" were heraldic "leopards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1867 |title=English Heraldry |pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1976), German heraldist [[Ottfried Neubecker]] explained:

{{quote|When the blazon does not specifically mention a position, the lion may be assumed to be rampant. If he is in a different position, other terminology must be used, referring to the position of his head and limbs. An early heraldic convention found in medieval blazons uses the distinction between a lion and a leopard previously employed by the ancient Greeks. In antiquity, the lion, having a heavy mane, was generally shown in profile, while the leopard, having less hair, was shown looking towards the observer. A lion looking towards the observer therefore came to be given the name of the animal usually shown in that pose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning|last=Neubecker |first=Ottfried |year=1976 |location=Maidenhead, England |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=111–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Neubecker, what in [[Old French]] is termed a ''léopard'' is always ''guardant'' (head turned toward the observer), thus the modern English heraldic terms "lion passant guardant", "lion passant", and "lion rampant guardant" correlate to the Old French terms ''léopard'', ''lion léopardé'', and ''léopard lionné'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker (1976), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[condominium]] or "condo" is a form of [[housing tenure]] and other [[real property]] where a specified part of a piece of real estate (usually of an [[apartment]] house) is individually owned. Use of land access to common facilities in the piece such as hallways, heating system, elevators, and exterior areas are executed under legal rights associated with the individual ownership. These rights are controlled by the association of owners that jointly represent ownership of the whole piece.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] indexes information about condominiums and cooperative apartments, among other types of households, at its Survey of Market Absorption of Apartments.&lt;ref name="US Census"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=755 | title=Data for condominium and apartments | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2015, this compilation includes 95 metropolitan areas of the United States.&lt;ref name="US Census"/&gt; Some condominium buildings in the United States have been listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In some cities in the United States, such as Lakewood, Ohio, city governments have attempted to invoke [[eminent domain]] upon residents to take over their property and enable private developers to build condominiums.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2003"&gt;{{cite web | title=Eminent Domain: Being Abused? | website=CBS News | date=September 26, 2003 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eminent-domain-being-abused/ | accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done in an effort to generate more revenue by increasing property tax bases.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2003"/&gt;

A [[housing cooperative]], or co-op, is a legal entity, usually a [[corporation]], which owns [[real estate]], consisting of one or more residential buildings; it is one type of [[housing tenure]]. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that have many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as [[single family home]] ownership, condominiums and [[renting]].&lt;ref name="What is a Housing Cooperative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalcooperativelawcenter.com/what-is-a-housing-cooperative/the-characteristics-of-housing-cooperatives/|title=The Characteristics of Housing Cooperatives|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malong1.jpg|thumb|A malong bearing [[batik]] designs.]]

The '''malong''' is a traditional "tube skirt" made of handwoven or machine-made multi-colored cotton cloth, bearing a variety of geometric or [[okir]] designs.  The malong is directly akin to the [[sarong]] worn by peoples in other parts of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] ([[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]). The malong is traditionally used as a garment by numerous tribes in the [[Southern Philippines]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and was historically worn throughout the archipelago by lowland maritime groups.

Handwoven malongs are made by [[Maranao]], [[Maguindanao]], and [[T'boli]] weavers on a backstrap loom.  The pattern or style of the malong may indicate the weaver's tribal origin, such as the Maranao ''malong landap''.  Very rare malong designs and styles can indicate the village in which the malong was made, for example, the extremely intricate ''malong rawatan'' made only by a handful of Maranao weavers in [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Mindanao]].  Handwoven malongs, which are costly, are likely to be used only at social functions, to display the social and economic status of the wearer.  While modern malongs are made of cotton and [[Lurex (yarn)|Lurex]] threads, some contemporary handwoven malongs are made of inexpensive rayon thread, to reduce the manufacturing cost to the weaver and ultimate cost to the consumer.  There are many grades of cotton thread, and the cost of a malong can also be reduced by using the lesser grades of cotton thread, or by creating a loose or coarse weave.

Machine-made printed cotton malongs are made in Indonesia specifically for export to the Philippines, and are commonly referred to as "batik" because the item is imported; those inexpensive machine-made malongs are used for everyday purposes.  The designs of traditional handwoven designs are used in imported cotton from Thailand, allowing the purchaser to have a cotton machine-printed malong which, from a distance, convincingly mimics the look of a much more expensive handwoven malong.

The malong can function as a skirt for both men and women, a [[turban]], [[Niqab]], [[Hijab]], a dress, a blanket, a sunshade, a bedsheet, a "dressing room", a hammock, a prayer mat, and other purposes. A newborn is wrapped in a ''malong,'' and as he grows this piece of cloth becomes a part of his daily life.  When he dies, he is once again wrapped in a ''malong''.  Among traditional tribal peoples, the malong is used in everyday life.  Even in areas where people wear Western-style clothing during the day, the malong is commonly used as sleepwear. The malong is also used in very big festivals, they wear this to show respect.

'''''Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps''''' is an equestrian portrait of a youthful black male painted by the contemporary artist [[Kehinde Wiley]] in 2005. It is based on [[Jacques-Louis David]]’s 1801 equestrian portrait, ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]''.  This painting was chosen by a man who Kehinde had approached in the streets.  The basic composition of Wiley's painting is the same as the 200-year-old painting it was based on, and has many of the same elements.  The modern painting has a decorative background rather than the battlefield background.

==Background==
This painting is very typical of the style of Kehinde Wiley in that it is a monumental painting that incorporates brocade/decorative motif as an element of the background. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/arts/design/review-kehinde-wiley-a-new-republic-at-the-brooklyn-museum.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;Many of Kehinde Wiley’s paintings, like ''Napoleon Leading the Army'', begin when he approaches a youthful black man in the streets (often from inner cities in the U.S.) and asks them to model for him.  Kehinde then asks them to choose a painting from art history books for their portrait, and photographs them in the appropriate pose before beginning the actual painting, just as he probably did with the man who modeled for Napoleon Leading His Army.&lt;ref&gt;"Kehinde Wiley FAQ."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the painting==

The subject is a youthful black man in fashionable street wear mounted on a rearing horse and pointing upwards.  The man has [[tattoo]]s on his right arm and is dressed in a [[camouflage]] shirt and [[cargo pants]].  He has a voluminous golden cloak and a [[saber]] attached at his waist.  He also wears [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] boots, [[Starter Clothing Line|Starter]] [[wristband]]s, and a white and black [[bandana]].&lt;ref&gt;“Teaching Source.”&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has a decorative, [[Baroque]] motif that looks very much like wallpaper in the painting’s background but also interrupts the foreground a bit, as the motif is painted in front of some of the rocks.  This flattened background clashes with the “[[photo-realist]] rendering” of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Shareef, “The Power of Décor,” 6.&lt;/ref&gt;   The rocky surface that serves as the ground of the painting has names engraved in the bottom left corner of the painting.  The names are: Williams (perhaps the name of the subject), Bonaparte, Hannibal, and Charlemagne.  There are small [[sperm cell]]s “swimming” over the whole canvas.  The whole painting is set in an elaborate gold colored frame, just as many European portraits of rulers were framed.

==Similarities between the two paintings==

The basic composition of Wiley’s painting is similar to the well-known portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte by Jacques-Louis David, and the two paintings share many elements &lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnet.com/artists/kehinde-wiley/biography&lt;/ref&gt;. The black male subject of Wiley's painting assumes the same pose as Napoleon does, with the same confidence in his face and similar body language.  Napoleon wears the uniform of a general in the painting by David, and while the black male is wearing fashionable street clothing, the camouflage pants and shirt have associations with the military, especially combined with the sword around his waist.  In both, there is a deliberate contrast between the confidence and calmness of the subject’s expression and the rearing horse’s flaring nostrils and wide eyes.   Both of the paintings have the names of other military leaders who had taken their armies over the Alps as if they were carved into the mountain’s rocky side, with the subject’s names among them, asserting them as their equals.  Just as David signed and dated his painting on the horse’s breastplate, so does Wiley, using Roman numerals.&lt;ref&gt;“Teaching Source.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Kehinde’s subject did not sit for the portrait, neither did Napoleon sit for David, but rather sent instructions that he should be depicted “‘calm on a spirited horse.’”&lt;ref&gt;Munhall, “Myth of Napoleon,” 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuagisme''' (literally "cloudism") is a French [[art-critical]] term that was advanced in the 1950s by art critic [[Julien Alvard]] (1916-1974).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bauddhamata.blogspot.de/2010/09/nuagisme.html Nuagisme, Clouds / sritantra, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">{{Italic title}}
'''''Op. cit.''''' is an abbreviation of the [[Latin phrase]] ''{{lang|la|opus citatum}}'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th"&gt;{{Chicago 16th |pp=670 |at=14.31 |title=‘''Op. cit.''’ and ‘''loc. cit.''’ |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the work cited".&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt;

==Overview==
The abbreviation is used in an [[endnote]] or [[footnote]] to refer the reader to a previously cited work, standing in for repetition of the full title of the work.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; ''Op. cit.'' thus refers the reader to the [[bibliography]], where the full citation of the work can be found, or to a full citation given in a previous footnote. ''Op. cit.'' should never therefore be used on its own, which would be meaningless, but most often with the author's surname,&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; or another brief clue as to which work is referred to. For example, given a work called ''The World of Salamanders'' (1999) by Jane Q. Smith, the style would typically be "Smith ''op. cit.''", usually followed by a page number, to refer the reader to a previous full citation of this work (or with further clarification such as "Smith 1999, ''op. cit.''" or "Smith, ''World of Salamanders'', ''op. cit.''", if two sources by that author are cited).  Given names or initials are not needed unless the work cites two authors with the same surname, as the whole purpose of using ''op. cit.'' is economy of text.  For works without an individually named author, the title can be used, e.g. "''CIA World Fact Book'', ''op. cit.''"  As usual with foreign words and phrases, ''op. cit.'' is typically given in italics.  The variant ''[[Loc. cit.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin phrase ''loco citato'' meaning "in the place cited",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; has been used for the same purpose but also indicating the same page not simply the same work; it is now rarely used or recognized.

The ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 16th edition, claims that ''op. cit.'' and ''loc. cit.'' are "rightly falling into disuse", and "instead uses the short-title form",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; e.g. the form ''World of Salamanders'', to use the example above.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 2"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.28: Short form for titles", pp.&amp;nbsp;668&amp;ndash;669.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various different styles call for other alternatives, such as a reference to the author's surname and publication year, e.g. "Smith 1999".&lt;!--Is this MLA style? A citation for it needs to be added from a major style guide, common as it may be.--&gt;

''Op. cit'' is contrasted with ''[[ibid.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin adverb ''ibidem'', meaning "in the same place; in that very place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |author=Marchant and Charles, eds. |edition=260th |chapter=ibidem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 3"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.29: ‘''Ibid.''’", p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers the reader to the title of the work in the preceding footnote. The easily confused ''[[idem]]'' (sometimes abbreviated ''id.''), the Latin definitive pronoun meaning "the same"&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.30: ‘''Idem''’", pp.&amp;nbsp;669&amp;ndash;630.&lt;/ref&gt; is also used on occasion (especially in legal writing) within footnotes, and is a stand-in for the last-cited author, rather than title.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4" /&gt; The Latin adverb ''[[supra (grammar)|supra]]'', meaning "above" means simply "see above" and can therefore be somewhat imprecise.

==Examples==
Footnotes 9 to 15:
* (9) R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar'' (Academic: New York, 1997), p. 23.
* (10) G. Wiki, ''Language and Its Uses'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2000), p. 217.
* (11) G. Wiki, ''Towards a More Perfect Speech'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 354.
* (12) G. Wiki, ''I Say, You Say'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 35.
* (13) Millan, ''op. cit.'', p. 5.
* (14) Wiki 2000, ''op. cit.'', p. 66.
* (15) Wiki, ''I Say, You Say op. cit.'', p. 4.

Reference number 13 refers to the last cited work by the author R. Millan, and hence, it is the same as in number 9 (R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar''), although the page referred to is different. Reference number 14 refers to reference number 10, ''Language and Its Uses'' (because the work was published in 2000), page 66. Reference number 15 refers to reference number 12: there are two works by Wiki published in 2003 so you must use the title.

For the short-title form:
* (9) R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar'' (Academic: New York, 1997), p. 23.
* (10) G. Wiki, ''Language and Its Uses'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2000), p. 217.
* (11) G. Wiki, ''Towards a More Perfect Speech'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 354
* (12) G. Wiki, ''I Say, You Say'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 35
* (13) ''Art of Latin Grammar'', p. 5.
* (14) ''Language and Its Uses'', p. 66.
* (15) ''I Say, You Say'', p. 4.

This is exactly the same as the long form above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1213">Originally used by Jesuits as a learning aid for students, '''painted enigmas''' are visual riddles - generally speaking, a picture with an easily understood superficial subject that contains a hidden meaning, usually one word.  This differed from similar visual riddles such as the [[emblem]] or hieroglyph ([[Horapollo]]'s "''Hieroglyphica''" for instance)which were simpler in design and intended to represent moral precepts. The emblem and painted enigma were similar in that each usually contained some clue that the composition contained a hidden meaning, usually a "written legend which might be a verbal riddle or rebus to be solved by the same word,or a simple epigrammatic motto such as constituted the 'soul' of the emblem." First developed at the Jesuit college Pont a Mousson in 1588, it developed into an erudite courtly entertainment by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Montagu]], “The Painted Enigma and French Seventeenth-Century Art,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 31 (1968), 307-309, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest verifiable painted enigmas from this era were painted by [[Charles Le Brun]].

'''Project Gutenberg Canada''', also known as '''Project Gutenburg of Canada''', is a Canadian digital library founded July 1, 2007. Their website allows Canadian residents to create e-texts and download books that are otherwise not in the [[public domain]] in other countries. 

It is not formally affiliated with the original [[Project Gutenberg]], though both share the common objective of making public domain books available for free to the general public as [[e-book]]s. Project Gutenburg Canada primarily focuses on works by Canadian authors or about Canada, as well as works in [[Canadian French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://gutenberg.ca/links/ourmission.html|website=Project Gutenberg Canada|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed Proofreaders Canada]] began contributing ebooks to Project Gutenberg Canada when launched on December 1, 2007.

==Canadian public domain==
{{see also|Copyright law of Canada}}
In Canada, [[Copyright law of Canada|the copyright period for works is 50 years after the year the author has died]]. Therefore, if the book was published during the author's lifetime and the author died 51 years ago or more, the book is in the Canadian public domain. Project Gutenberg Canada has received permission to redistribute books still under copyright in some cases.

Some authors whose works have entered the public domain in Canada and are thus available on Project Gutenberg Canada are [[A. A. Milne]], [[Walter de la Mare]], [[Sheila Kaye-Smith]], [[Amy Carmichael]], [[Gertrude Lawrence]], [[Marshall Broomhall]], [[Lilias Trotter]], [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], [[Isobel Kuhn]], and [[George Orwell]].

The '''Public Dance Halls Act 1935''' ({{lang-ga|Acht Um Hallai Rinnce Puibli, 1935}}) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Oireachtas]] which regulates [[dance hall]]s in Ireland by introducing a licensing system and a tax on admission tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dance Theatre in Ireland: Revolutionary Moves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2EbCeH5DWQIC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=7 December 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-03547-9|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The proposals were based on the recommendations of the 1932 report of the Carrigan Commission into [[juvenile sex crimes]].&lt;ref name="history707"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/707|title=Review of 'Ireland’s Magdalen Laundries and the Nation’s Architecture of Containment'|last=Murphy|first=Paula|date=December 2008|work=Reviews in History|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Carrigan Report recommendations were enacted in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, which raised the [[age of consent]] and banned artificial [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="history707" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/index.html|title=Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On dance halls, the report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In the course of the Inquiry no form of abuse was blamed more persistently for pernicious consequences than the unlicensed dances held all over the country in unsuitable buildings and surroundings, for the profit of persons who are liable to no control or supervision by any authority. The scandals that are the outcome of such a situation are notorious. They have been denounced in [[Pastoral letter|pastoral]]s, exposed in the Press, and condemned by clergy, judges and justices, without avail. Before us the Commissioner, speaking for the [[Garda Síochána|Civic Guard]], said these dance gatherings in many districts were turned into "orgies of dissipation, which in the present state of legislation the police are powerless to prevent." In short, there is no effective legislation to put down this nuisance.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Public Dance Halls Bill was introduced in 1934 by the [[Government of the 8th Dáil|then government]] of [[Fianna Fáil]], and supported by the opposition [[Fine Gael]] and [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1934062800016?opendocument|title=In Committee on Finance. - Public Dance Halls Bill, 1934—Second Stage.|date=28 June 1934|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was supported by [[Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference|the Catholic hierarchy]]. Secular nationalist institutions like the [[Gaelic League]] the legislation were seen as beneficial for protecting Irish culture against foreign influence.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Gedutis|title=See You at the Hall: Boston's Golden Era of Irish Music And Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtO3jbQ1YZ0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=1 July 2005|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-640-4|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effect==
Licensing is administered at the [[District Court (Ireland)|district court]], subject to the discretion of the local judge. In the early years of its effect, they were less tolerant of more recently introduced musical styles, such as [[set dancing]] (seen as "foreign") and [[1930s in jazz|jazz]] dance clubs.&lt;ref name="Roche2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Roche|title=The Cambridge Companion to Brian Friel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jexvtdc88PMC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=19 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-82767-6|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Stokes|author2=Philip V.

This set the conditions for the predominance of the [[céilidh]], with its large and loud musical ensembles and wide open dance spaces.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallely1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fintan Vallely|title=The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xN1VS6sWsEC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=28 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-8802-8|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ceilidh]] arose at the expense of older traditional music, which declined in popularity for decades until the creation of the [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]], and later the [[Folk Revival]] brought new attention to traditional Irish music.&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"/&gt;

==Current status==
The Act remains in force, with amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/isbc/1935.html#a2_1935|title=Legislation directory: Public Dance Halls Act, 1935 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nightclub]]s may be subject to stricter conditions in some districts than in others, depending on the particular judge. The Irish Nightclub Industry Association has described the legislation as "archaic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelandrestauranttimes.ie/featuredhotelon10.html|title=INIA aim to improve standards|date=October–November 2010|work=Hotel and Restaurant Times Magazine|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 there was confusion about whether the Act applied to [[lapdancing]] clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/lapdancing-clubs-caught-on-the-hop-26249477.html|title=Lapdancing clubs caught on the hop|last=Dodd|first=Stephen|date=1 July 2001|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">The '''Terra Foundation for American Art''' is a privately operated nonprofit organization dedicated to the support of American art exhibitions, projects, academic research, and publications worldwide. Its goal is to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of the cultural and artistic heritage of the United States through the acquisition, study, and display of works of American art. 
The Foundation was established by [[Daniel J. Terra]] in 1978 along with the [[Terra Museum|Terra Museum of American Art]], which opened in 1980. Terra was a businessman and art collector who used his own collection of influential American art to realize the goals of the Foundation. The Foundation is headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

The Terra Foundation uses its endowment to award grants for exhibitions, fellowships, symposia, research, publications, and academic programs, with a special focus on international initiatives and local Chicago initiatives. It works closely with educators, scholars, curators, and museums. 

Despite the closure of the Museum in 2004, the Foundation continues to actively collect paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and other objects representing achievement in American art from the late eighteenth century to 1945. The collection currently comprises hundreds of works by artists such as [[John Singleton Copley]], [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Edward Hopper]]. The Foundation lends these works to institutions and exhibitions worldwide and maintains a comprehensive database of the collection. A selection of Terra Foundation paintings remains on long-term loan to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and the Art Institute also houses the Foundation’s collection of works on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j4VSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ar4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5633,5554224&amp;dq=terra-foundation&amp;hl=en|date= June 22, 2003 |work=Telegraph-Herald |title=Terra Museum of American Art to close }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New exhibit on Terra firma;Collections unite to capture 'the sweep of American culture' |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=109A7AE4DDC3F448&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Misha Davenport |date= April 14, 2005 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation has longstanding presence in France. In 1992, it opened the [[Musée d'Art Américain Giverny]], a museum managed in partnership with the French government and the [[Musée d’Orsay]] which focuses on international impressionism. In 2009, the Terra Foundation opened its Paris Center to support its programs in Europe. The Paris Center houses the only research library in Europe dedicated exclusively to American art and transatlantic artistic exchange.

'''''The Blue Kitchen''''' (Norwegian: '''''Det blå kjøkken'''''; dated 1913) is the title of a [[neo-impressionism|neo-impressionist]] [[painting]] by [[Norway|Norwegian]] artist [[Ludvig Karsten]], showing a kitchen table ready for breakfast, while the morning sun is shining through the window. 

''The Blue Kitchen'' is regarded among Karsten's most important paintings. It is located at the [[National Gallery of Norway|National Gallery]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref name=nmk2&gt;{{cite book |title=Norges Malerkunst |editor=Berg, Knut |volume=2 |first=Marit|last=Lange |first2=Nils |last2=Messel |year=1993 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |pages=25–27 |isbn=82-05-20587-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messel&gt;{{cite book |title=Ludvig Karsten |first=Nils |last=Messel |year=1995 |publisher=Messel forlag |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |pages=112–117 |isbn=82-7631-027-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1913 Karsten was newly married, and the couple moved from [[Copenhagen]] to the Norwegian island [[Hvasser]]. Sources differ whether ''Blue Kitchen'' is painted in Copenhagen or Hvasser. The painting was bought by art collector Christian Tetzen-Lund in 1913. In his notebook he called it ''Det blaa Vindue'', and he had paid a price of {{NOK|125}}. ''The blue Kitchen'' was first publicly exhibited at [[Høstutstillingen|The Autumn Exhibition]] in Kristiania in 1913, and also at an exhibition in Copenhagen later the same year. The National Gallery acquired the painting after offering a price of {{NOK|800}}.&lt;ref name=messel/&gt;

==Related works==
An earlier rejected study by Karsten, ''Oppstilling ved vindu'' is located on the back side of his painting ''Pløyemark'' from 1909. Karsten's painting ''From my blue Kitchen'' from 1913, where his wife Misse is modelled standing in their kitchen, was exhibited in Kristiania from March to April 1913, and is currently located at [[Statens Museum for Kunst]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;Messel 1995: p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1913 Autumn Exhibition in Kristiania Karsten also exhibited another [[still life|still]] painting, ''[[The red Kitchen]]'', which has later (in 1926) been acquired by the National Gallery in Oslo.&lt;ref name=messel/&gt; Karsten's painting ''Atelierinteriør'' ({{lang-en|Studio interior}}) from 1926 (lost in a fire during World War II) had ''The blue Kitchen'' hanging on the painted wall.&lt;ref&gt;Messel 1995: p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel Hughes at Skywalker.JPG|thumb|200px|Daniel Hughes, conductor]]
[[File:The Choral Project at Skywalker.jpg|thumb|400px|Conductor Daniel Hughes and The Choral Project recording at [[Skywalker Sound]].]]
Based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], '''The Choral Project''' is a mixed-voice [[choir]] founded in 1996 by artistic director and conductor Daniel D. Hughes [http://danielhughesmusic.com].  The group's vision is ''"to heal our world through music and words,"'' while their mission is ''"to connect to one another through choral theater, education and musical excellence."''

The Choral Project's repertoire is broad and diverse, ranging from [[Bach]], [[Debussy]], and [[Brahms]] to modern composers like [[Kirke Mechem]], Rene Clausen, [[Michael Ostrzyga]], Stephen Jackson and [[Eric Whitacre]].  They have performed in Washington D.C.'s [[National Cathedral]], San Francisco's [[Mission Dolores]] Basilica, Mission Santa Clara de Asís, Santa Cruz' [[Mission Santa Cruz|Holy Cross Church]], and multiple venues in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Mexico]].  During their 2001 tour, The Choral Project appeared live on Mexican National Radio. In 2004, the ensemble competed in the Mixed Choir division of the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales, coming away with a second-place finish. In 2007, while competing against six choirs from around the world at the California International Choral Festival &amp; Competition in San Luis Obispo, CA, the group placed in all three categories - 1st place in the Choir's Choice category, 2nd place in the Required Music category and 3rd in the Folk Music category.

Every season, The Choral Project uses one concert to focus on an important social issue. For example, in February 2017 the choir performed [[Street Requiem]] with mezzo soprano [[Frederica von Stade]] to highlight the issue of homelessness. The [[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] wrote, "The piece, said the 53-voice Choral Project’s artistic director Daniel Hughes, addresses issues of what it’s like to live on the streets and assumes the voice of the homeless in confronting the audience, 'Why do you ignore me when you leave the concert hall?'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/arts-and-entertainment/20170215/choral-project-presents-meditation-on-homelessness|title=Choral Project presents meditation on homelessness|date=15 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, The Choral Project has released eight albums: ''The Cycle of Life'', ''Of Christmastide'', ''Americana'', ''Water &amp; Light'' (the group’s #1 best seller on the Clarion label), ''Winter'', ''One is the All'', ''Tell the World'', and most recently ''Yuletide'', a festive collection of holiday favorites.

The Choral Project also performs on the San José Chamber Orchestra recording of the dramatic oratorio ''[[Choose Life, Uvacharta Bachayim]]'', by composer [[Mona Lyn Reese]] and librettist Delores Dufner, OSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sjco.org/collaborations/|title=Collaborations – San Jose Chamber Orchestra|website=sjco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Choral Project is also a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization involved in community outreach, including a choral mentorship program for local high school students, joint performances with visiting choirs and an annual Choral Composition Contest for high school students and undergraduates.

'''Trebizond Gospel''', '''ℓ''' ''243'' (in the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbering), is a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[illuminated manuscript]] with the text of Gospel [[Lectionary]], dating [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] to the 11th century with 15 parchment leaves (33 by 36.5 cm) from the 10th century or earlier.

== Description ==
[[File:Trebizond_gospel.jpg|thumb|left|Trebizond gospel]]
The text is written in two columns per page, 18 lines per page in [[Uncial script|uncial]] letters.&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;[[Kurt Aland|K. Aland]], M. Welte, B. Köster, K. Junack, ''Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neues Testaments'', (Berlin, New York: [[Walter de Gruyter]], 1994), p. 243. &lt;/ref&gt; It contains 15 pictures.&lt;ref name = Gregory&gt;[[Caspar René Gregory|C. R. Gregory]], "Textkritik des Neuen Testaments", Leipzig 1900, vol. 1, p. 408. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The book was richly decorated with gold and jewels by the Trapezuntine Emperor [[Andronicus II of Trebizond|Andronicus]]. In 1858, the ''Trebizond Gospel'' was presented by the Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] to the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]], who donated it to the [[Russian National Library]], where is held to the present day (Codex Gr. 21, 21a).&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt;

It was examined and described by [[Eduard de Muralt]].&lt;ref&gt;Eduard de Muralt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dc4WAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Catalogue des manuscrits grecs de la Bibliothèque Impériale publique''] (Petersburg 1864), pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript is not cited in the critical editions of the Greek New Testament (UBS3), because of its small textual value.&lt;ref&gt;''The Greek New Testament'', ed. K. Aland, A. Black, C. M. Martini, B. M. Metzger, and A. Wikgren, in cooperation with INTF, ''United Bible Societies'', 3rd edition, (Stuttgart 1983), pp. XXVIII, XXX.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''unfinished creative work''' is a painting, [[novel]], musical composition, or other [[creative work]], that has not been brought to a completed state. Its creator may have chosen not to finish it, or may have been prevented from doing so by circumstances outside of their control, such as [[death]]. Such pieces are often the subject of speculation as to what the finished piece would have been like had the original creator completed the work. Sometimes artworks are finished by others and [[List of works published posthumously|released posthumously]]. Unfinished works have had profound influences on their genres and have inspired others in their own projects. The term can also refer to ongoing work which could eventually be finished (i.e. the creator is still living) and is distinguishable from "incomplete work", which can be a work that was finished but is no longer in its complete form.

There are many reasons for work not being completed. Works are usually stopped when their creator dies, although some, aware of their failing health, make sure that they set up the project for completion. If the work involves other people, such as a cast of actors or the subject of a portrait, it may be halted because of their unavailability. Projects that are too grandiose might never have been finished, while others should be feasible but their creator's continual unhappiness with them leads to abandonment.

Unfinished works by popular authors and artists may still be made public, sometimes in the state they were in when work was halted.  Alternatively, another artist may finish the piece.  In some fields work may appear unfinished but are actually finished, such as [[Donatello]]'s "[[non finito]]" technique in [[sculpture]].

==Media==

===Literature===
[[File:Kafka1906.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Kafka]]'s unfinished writings were released after his death despite his wishes for them to be destroyed.]]
Many acclaimed [[author]]s have left work incomplete. Some such pieces have been published posthumously, either in their incomplete state or after being finished by somebody else.

It is the job of [[literary executor]]s to take charge of the work of a writer after their death.  They must often decide what to do with incomplete work, using their own judgement if not given explicit instructions.  In some cases this can lead to something happening to the work that was not originally intended, such as the release of [[Franz Kafka]]'s unfinished writings by [[Max Brod]] when Kafka had wished for them to be destroyed.  These works have become iconic in [[Western literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Contijoch, Francesc Miralles (2000) "Franz Kafka". ''Oceano Grupo Editorial, S.A. Barcelona.'' {{ISBN|84-494-1811-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The posthumous publication of some of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s unfinished novels was met with controversy. Several books were published, but it has been suggested that it is not within the jurisdiction of Hemingway's relatives or publishers to determine whether these works should be made available to the public.  For example, scholars often disapprovingly note that the version of ''The Garden of Eden'' published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] in 1986, though not a revision of Hemingway's original words, nonetheless omits two-thirds of the original manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/shortguide-garden_of_eden/ BookRags] makes this quantitative note; it also reveals some more information about the publication of ''The Garden of Eden'' and offers some discussion of thematic content.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Twain]] took 20 years to write three versions of ''[[The Mysterious Stranger]]'' but he did not finish any of them.]]
Novels can remain unfinished because the author continually rewrites the story. When enough material exists, someone else can compile and combine the work, creating a finished story from several different drafts.  [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Stranger]]'' was written in three different versions over a period of 20 years, none of which were completed.  Twain biographer and literary executor [[Albert Paine]] combined the stories and published his version six years after Twain's death.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20040918015059/http://www.geocities.com/hal9000report/hal96.html  A History of War]".  Accessed 6 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] continuously rewrote ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' throughout his lifetime; a definitive version was still uncompiled at the time of his death, with some sections very fragmented.  His son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], invited fantasy fiction writer [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] to reconstruct some parts of the book, and they eventually published a final version in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkienlibrary.com.  "[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/reviews/silmarillion.htm Collecting The Silmarillion]".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Christopher Tolkien published another posthumous collection of his father's unfinished work, appropriately entitled ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.  Between 1982 and 1996, he published twelve volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', a substantial portion of which is unfinished and incomplete drafts.  In 2007, Christopher Tolkien published another novel from his father entitled ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.  Like ''The Silmarillion'', Christopher assembled the novel from various incomplete drafts.

The size of a project can be such that a piece of literature is never finished.  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] never completed ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' to the extensive length that he originally intended. Chaucer had, however, already written much of the work at the time of his death, and the ''Canterbury Tales'' are considered to be a seminal work despite the unfinished status.&lt;ref&gt;6 December 2000.  "[http://ccsun7.sogang.ac.kr/~anthony/Chaucer/index.htm The Canterbury Tales Geoffrey Chaucer : an overall survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825163916/http://ccsun7.sogang.ac.kr/~anthony/Chaucer/index.htm |date=25 August 2006 }}".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; English poet [[Edmund Spenser]] originally intended ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to consist of 12 books; even at its unfinished state&amp;mdash;six books were published before Spenser's death&amp;mdash;it is the longest epic poem in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;''The Faerie Queene'' is about [https://books.google.com/books?vid=LCCN13011576&amp;id=dBqqd47DWK8C&amp;q=%22faerie+queene%22+number+of+verses&amp;dq=%22faerie+queene%22+number+of+verses&amp;pgis=1 35,000 verses] long. By comparison, ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'' is about 24,000 verses long, and  ''[[Beowulf]]'' is about 3,000 verses long. The Sanskrit language ''[[Mahabharata]]'', however, is many times longer than ''The Faerie Queene''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Honoré de Balzac]], the French novelist, completed nearly 100 pieces for his [[novel sequence]] ''[[La Comédie humaine]]'', but a planned 48 more were never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Citron edition, vol 1, 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notes and plot outlines left behind by an author may allow a successor to complete a novel or series of novels.  [[Frank Herbert]] left behind extensive notes related to his [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]], which led to son [[Brian Herbert]] and science fiction author [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s completing several [[prequel]]s to the popular series.&lt;ref&gt;Dune 7 Blog.  16 December 2005.  "[http://www.dunenovels.com/dune7blog/page21.html Conspiracy Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012125808/http://dunenovels.com/dune7blog/page21.html |date=12 October 2007 }}".  Accessed 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mervyn Peake]], author of the [[Gormenghast series|Gormenghast]] novels, meant to write a complete biography of the main character, Titus, but died after only completing three books in the series.

Some works are presented as separate sections, each written at different times.  This can lead to a piece appearing complete while the author actually intended for it to continue, or where other authors try to fake their own writing as part of the work.  The first four [[canto]]s of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]'s [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were written in 1818 and 1819, with a further 12 completed and published before his death in 1824.  Numerous "continuations" of the story had been published by various publishing houses even between issues of the story, along with several fake conclusions.  Byron had intended to continue the story, as evidenced by the find of the 17th canto after his death, but it is not clear how long the poem would continue or how it would conclude.  It is still regarded as one of his greatest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Hubeart, Thomas 1996.  "[http://members.aol.com/basfawlty/byron.htm Whatever Happened to Don Juan? Finding the Ending to Byron's Poem]".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Dickens]] was writing ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' in monthly installments when he died, completing just six of the twelve intended.  The story surrounded the murder of the titular Edwin Drood; because the story was never finished, the murderer was never revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, David.  David Perdue's Charles Dickens page.  "[http://charlesdickenspage.com/drood.html The Mystery of Edwin Drood]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was still made into a film and [[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (musical)|a musical]], with the latter having the unusual concept of the audience voting for who they think is the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Tams-Witmark Music Library.  "[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/drood.html Drood (The Mystery of Edwin Drood)]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous unfinished works of literature include: ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' by [[Christopher Marlowe]] (a completion was provided by [[George Chapman]]); the second part of ''[[Dead Souls]]'' by [[Gogol]]; ''[[Bouvard et Pécuchet]]'' by [[Gustave Flaubert]]; ''[[Weir of Hermiston]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]; ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Hašek]]; ''[[Suite française (Irène Némirovsky)|Suite française]]'' by [[Irène Némirovsky]], ''[[Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel|Answered Prayers]]'' by [[Truman Capote]], ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' by [[F.

====Science, theology and philosophy====
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] stopped work on his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' in 1273 after a mystical experience.]]
Religious works have also been left incomplete, leading to debates about the possible missing content. Some theologians consider the [[Gospel of Mark]], in its existing form, incomplete; the text after 16:8 is probably not original, thus creating speculation whether the author was arrested or died suddenly, or whether the end of the gospel could have broken away from the rest of the gospel as it was handed to the next person.&lt;ref name="Mark's Incomplete Gospel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Scriptures (New Testament) Alleged forgery in the Gospel of Mark|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/mark_16.htm|work=Religious Tolerance|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunni Islamic classic Qur'anic commentary, Mafatihu-l-Ghayb, better known as Tafseer Al-Kabeer ([[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)]]) by [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] was left unfinished and it was finished by either Qadi Shahab-ud-deen bin Khaleel al-Khauli, of [[Damascus]] (died 639 AH) or Shaikh Najm-ud-deen Ahmad bin Al-Qamooli (died 777 AH) as mentioned in Kashf-az-Zunoon. The [[Masnavi]], the most famous poem in [[Sunni]] Islamic [[Sufi poetry]] by [[Rumi]] was left unfinished and it was later finished by [[Mufti]] [[Ilahi Baksh Kandhlawi]] about five hundred years after the demise of [[Rumi]]. The [[Persian Bayán]], a [[religious text|scripture]] from [[Bábism]], was left unfinished when the [[Báb]] died.  There have been some claims that the text has been completed by other people, though the Báb stated that it would be finished by [him] whom God shall make manifest.&lt;ref&gt;Poirier, Brent; Terry, Peter;
Buck, Christopher; Momen, Moojan; Winters, Jonah.  "[http://bahai-library.com/resources/tablets-notes/bayan/notes.html The Bayán]".  Accessed 11 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pottenger, Elizabeth.  "[http://bahai-library.com/pottenger_disclosure_station Baha'u'llah's Disclosure of His Station]".  Accessed 11 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] abandoned his great work the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' in 1273, citing a mystical experience during Mass.  Its arguments for the existence of God continue to exert influence in philosophy and [[Christian theology]] more than 700 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Stephen.  "[http://www.faithnet.org.uk/Theology/aquinas.htm Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274 CE)]".  Accessed 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Greek philosophy, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'' was unfinished when Plato died at age 80.

The most influential document in [[computer science]] was [[John von Neumann]]'s ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'', a 101-page manuscript dating from 1946.  Littered with ellipses and spaces for the eventual addition of further material, von Neumann never completed it, as by that time its distribution had already influenced an explosion in postwar computer development.  Its elaboration of the [[stored program]] concept and formalization of the logical design of computer architecture&amp;mdash;ideas not all of which were original to von Neumann but which he first expressed in the mathematical language he favoured&amp;mdash;endure in the architectures of modern computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Goldstine|Goldstine, Herman H]].  1972.  ''The Computer: from Pascal to von Neumann''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.  {{ISBN|0-691-02367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still in computer science, the seminal work on algorithms, ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' by [[Donald Knuth]], has had only the first three of its seven planned volumes written.

The first genuine [[historiography|historiographical]] work, the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by [[Thucydides]], was undergoing a major revision by the author at the time of his death, so different sections of it reflect a starkly contrasting general outlook on Persian influence in the events depicted.

===Drawings, paintings and sculptures===

[[File:Dickens dream.jpg|thumb|right|''Dickens' Dream'', by [[Robert William Buss]], begun on the death of [[Charles Dickens]] in 1870, and incomplete at the time of the painter's death in 1875.]]

Artists leave behind incomplete work for a variety of reasons. A piece may not be completed if the subject becomes unavailable, such as in the changing of a landscape or the death of a person being painted.  [[Elizabeth Shoumatoff]]'s ''[[Unfinished portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Unfinished Portrait]]'' of 32nd [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was started around noon on 12 April 1945 but left unfinished when Roosevelt died later that day. In other instances, outside circumstances can prevent the execution of an otherwise "finished" artwork: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] developed sketches and models for the {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} "Gran Cavallo" horse statue but the bronze to cast the sculpture was diverted to make cannons.&lt;ref name="vezzosi"&gt;[[Alessandro Vezzosi|Vezzosi, Alessandro]], ''Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Man'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1997, {{p.|73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Five hundred years later, two full-size sculptures were completed based on Leonardo's work.&lt;ref name="leo-horse"&gt;''[http://www.leonardoshorse.org/never_was_is.asp The horse that never was...is!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903015833/http://www.leonardoshorse.org/never_was_is.asp |date=3 September 2006 }}'' Accessed 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Technically  his ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' is unfinished. In most pictures it shows a roof, but at Milan, where the painting lies, it shows some [[Latin]] that is half done. [[Robert William Buss]] left unfinished his most famous painting, ''Dickens' Dream'', just as [[Charles Dickens]] himself had left a novel half-complete at his death.

Depending on the medium involved, it can be difficult for another artist to complete an unfinished artwork without damaging it. Some artists completed the paintings of their mentors, such as [[Giulio Romano]] is believed to have done on [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gerten-Jackson, Carol.  "[http://cgfa.floridaimaging.com/raphael/raphael_bio.htm Raphael]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]] on [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]''.  27 July 2006.  "[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7218457 Venetian art: The line of beauty]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of completing another artist's masterpiece, particularly when many years have passed, unfinished works frequently inspire others to create their own version.  [[Michelangelo]] left several unfinished [[sculpture]]s and [[painting]]s, with sketches and partially completed paintings inspiring others.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Jim.  24 March 1999.  "[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=r&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=452 A Painter's Legacy]".  Accessed 6 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the work is to be done on commission but is not finished it is commonly passed on to another artist.  Leonardo da Vinci's work on the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the monastery of San Donato was halted when he left [[Florence]] for [[Milan]].  Still requiring an [[altarpiece]], the monks employed [[Filippino Lippi]] to create one.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Leonardo: ''[http://www.universalleonardo.org/lifeevent.php?event=242 Birth of Filippino Lippi]''. Retrieved 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Both paintings now hang in the [[Uffizi]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Loadstar's Lair.  "[http://www.lairweb.org.nz/leonardo/magi.html Adoration of the Magi]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paintings are usually sketched on the [[canvas]] before work begins, and sculptures are frequently planned using a [[maquette]].  These works-in-progress can be as sought after as (or even more sought after than) completed works by highly regarded artists because they help reveal the process of creating a work of art.  [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], a sculptor from the [[Baroque]] period, made his bozzetti (an Italian term for the prototype sculpture) from [[wax]] or baked [[terracotta]] to show those that had commissioned him how the final piece was intended to look.  Eleven of these bozzetti were displayed in an exhibition at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Victor M.  [[artnet]].  2004.  "[http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/reviews/cassidy/cassidy8-25-98.asp Chicago Report]".  Accessed 22 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[museum]]s specialise in collections of maquettes, such as the [[Museo dei Bozzetti]] in [[Pietrasanta]], [[Italy]].

During the [[Renaissance]], [[Donatello]] made sculptures that appeared unfinished by only sculpting part of the block, leaving the figure appearing to be stuck within the material.  He called this technique "[[non finito]]", and it has been used by several artists since then.&lt;ref&gt;The Open Door Web Site.  "[http://www.saburchill.com/history/events/014.html The Renaissance]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of [[mass media]], incomplete work can reach an audience due to sheer demand for material by the artist.  ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'', the 24th [[comics|comic]] in [[Hergé]]'s popular ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series, was unfinished at his death.  Though he had illustrated much of the book, several sketched panels remained in the final scenes.  The book was still published and the story can be followed despite the incomplete artwork.

===Architecture, construction and engineering===
{{See also|Unfinished building}}

Many [[construction]] or [[engineering]] projects have remained unfinished at various stages of development.  The work may be finished as a [[blueprint]] or [[whiteprint]] and never be realised, or be abandoned during construction.

There are numerous [[unfinished building]]s that remain partially constructed in countries around the world, some of which can be used in their incomplete state, while others remain as mere shells.  An example of the latter is the [[Ryugyong Hotel]] in [[North Korea]].  If finished, it would become the tallest hotel in the world and the seventh [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Emporis]].  "[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=130967 Ryugyong Hotel]".  Accessed 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but is uninhabitable and will not be completed due to the cost and the poor structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Emporis.  28 July 2000.  "[http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/nc/ne/?id=100302 Ryugyong Hotel on hold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021204752/http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/nc/ne/?id=100302 |date=21 October 2006 }}".  Accessed 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some projects are intentionally left with an unfinished appearance, particularly the [[folly|follies]] of the late 16th to 18th century.

There are many reasons for construction works being halted.  Amongst others, they include a changing financial climate, unforeseen structural weaknesses, and a dramatic shift in the politics of a country.  Work on the [[Palace of Soviets]], a project to construct the world's largest building in [[Moscow]], was halted when the city [[Operation Barbarossa|was attacked]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Beautiful Atrocities.  8 April 2005.

Accessed 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some buildings are in a cycle of near-perpetual construction, with work lasting for decades or even centuries.  [[Antoni Gaudí]]'s [[Sagrada Família]] in [[Barcelona]] has been under construction for around 120 years, having started in [[1882]].  Work was delayed by the [[Spanish Civil War]], during which part of the original models  were destroyed. After the restoration of these models, the works are still in progress and the prevision is that the building will be finished in 2026.  Today, even with portions of the [[basilica]] incomplete, it is still the most popular tourist destination in Barcelona with 1.5 million visitors every year.  Gaudí spent 40 years of his life overseeing the project and is buried in the crypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barcelona Information.  "[http://www.barcelona-information.com/sagrada-familia.html Barcelona Sagrada Familia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823045014/http://www.barcelona-information.com/sagrada-familia.html |date=23 August 2006 }}".  Accessed 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in Barcelona, construction on the [[Barcelona Cathedral]] started in 1298, but its dome and central tower only was finished in 1913, 615 years later. [[Germany]]'s [[Cologne Cathedral]] took even longer to complete, from 1248 to 1880, a total of 632 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]] World Heritage.

[[File:Kolner Dom kurz vor der Fertigstellung 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of [[Cologne Cathedral]] took over 600 years.]]
It is not only buildings that have failed during the construction phase.  In the 1920s, the [[White Star Line]] hired the shipbuilders [[Harland and Wolff]] to build the first {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[ocean liner]], with the planned name of ''[[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|Oceanic]]''.  However, a dispute between the companies and eventually the [[Great Depression]] halted the construction, and eventually the portion of the [[keel]] already constructed was broken up and used in building the smaller but similar ship, the ''[[MV Britannic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Othfors, Daniel.  "[http://www.greatoceanliners.net/intendedgiants.html Intended Giants of the Seas]".  Accessed 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s the [[Hoan Bridge]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] was out of use for five years after its construction when the connecting roads were not completed.  In the 1980s, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], [[Iraq]]i president [[Saddam Hussein]] commissioned the [[Project Babylon|Babylon project]].  The [[supergun]] design by [[Gerald Bull]] was never fully constructed after Bull's [[assassination]] in March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Mark.  Encyclopedia Astronautica.  "[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/babongun.htm Babylon Gun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119144359/http://astronautix.com/lvs/babongun.htm |date=19 November 2010 }}".

Many projects do not get to the construction phase and are halted during or after planning.  [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] commissioned several designs for [[Falkenstein Castle (Pfronten)|Castle Falkenstein]], with the fourth plan being vastly different from the first.  The first two designs were turned down, one because of costs and one because the design displeased Ludwig, and the third designer withdrew from the project.  The fourth and final plan was completed and some [[infrastructure]] was prepared for the site, but Ludwig died before construction work began.&lt;ref&gt;Yan, Mark.

Sir [[Christopher Wren]], most famous for his role in rebuilding several churches after the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, sketched a proposed replacement for a part of the palace, but financial constraints prevented construction.

Computer technology has allowed for [[3D computer graphics|3D representations]] of projects to be shown before they are built.  In some cases the construction is never started and the [[computer simulation|computer model]] is the nearest that anyone can ever get to seeing the finished piece.  For example, in 1999 Kent Larson's exhibition "''Unbuilt Ruins: Digital Interpretations of Eight Projects by Louis I. Kahn''" showed computer images of designs completed by noted [[architect]] [[Louis Kahn]] but never built.&lt;ref&gt;Eiteljorg II, Harrison.  1999.

Accessed 21 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer simulations can also be used to create [[prototype]]s of engineering projects and test them before they are actually made; this has allowed the design process to be more successful and efficient.

Even without being constructed, many architectural designs and ideas have had a lasting influence.  The [[Russia]]n [[constructivism (art)|constructivism movement]] started in 1913&lt;ref&gt;HuntFor.com.  "[http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/C20th/constructivism.htm Constructivism]".

===Music===

====Classical music====
{{see also|Unfinished symphony|Composer tributes (classical music)}}
In the days of [[classical music]] all compositions were sketched on manuscripts – the technology to record music did not exist.  Often these manuscripts are roughly sketched, with drafting work scribbled over the top of the music, and have been found in unordered piles.  Many [[unfinished symphony|unfinished symphonies]] have been pieced together from these original manuscripts by other composers, after the original author's death, with some remaining incomplete until many decades later.  One of the most famous examples of unfinished musical compositions is [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 8 in B minor]]'', or as it is more commonly known, ''The Unfinished Symphony''.&lt;ref&gt;Vial Jaffe, Jane.  Stockton Symphony Association.  "[http://www.stocktonsymphony.org/Program06-Schubert.htm Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D759] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822051700/http://www.stocktonsymphony.org/Program06-Schubert.htm |date=22 August 2006 }}".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another famous unfinished classical piece is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]'', famous in part because of the numerous myths and legends that surround its creation and in part because of Mozart's prestige. At the time of his death, Mozart had fully orchestrated only the first movement, leaving nine further movements in varying states of completion. [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr]], an acquaintance of Mozart, finished the nine incomplete movements and wrote four more. [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 10]] was incomplete, with only drafts, sketches, and two mostly orchestrated movements existing at the composer's death.  Several people have "completed" it with varying degrees of success, the most notable of these being [[Deryck Cooke]]'s "performing version of the draft."&lt;ref name = Cooke&gt;{{cite book|title = A Performing Version for the Draft of the Tenth Symphony|last= Cooke|first= Deryck  |publisher = Associated Music Publishers|year=1976|isbn = 0-571-51094-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bach-unfinishedfugue.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' breaks off abruptly during ''Contrapunctus XIV''.]]
Some compositions are finished "in the style of" the original composer, with someone who is highly familiar with the work adopting the same writing style and continuing the musical tone. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', which was broken off abruptly during ''Contrapunctus XIV'', probably shortly before the death of the composer, was first published in the mid 18th century. Many reconstructions have been written, but in 1991 [[Zoltán Göncz]] used the form of a [[Fugue#perm|permutation fugue]] to make a strong argument as to the structure of the Fugue to come.&lt;ref&gt;Göncz, Z.  1997.  Reconstruction of the Final Contrapunctus of ''[[The Art of Fugue]], in: ''International Journal of Musicology'' Vol. 5, pp. 25–93. {{ISBN|3-631-49809-8}}; Vol. 6, pp. 103–119. 1998 {{ISBN|3-631-33413-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See external links.) Sir [[Edward Elgar]] was composing a [[Symphony No. 3 (Elgar/Payne)|Symphony No. 3]] at the time of his death and left 130 pages of sketches.  These sketches were put into a reasonable order, orchestrated in the style of Elgar, and elaborated by [[Anthony Payne]].  Payne's reconstruction has been played numerous times to great acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/elgar/56393.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anthony Payne on Elgar's Symphony No 3 | date=13 February 1998 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some works, deemed complete by the composer, are nonetheless augmented for non-musical reasons. In May 2000 composer [[Colin Matthews]] premiered his "completion" of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', whereby he composed a piece for the ninth planet [[Pluto]], giving it the name "Pluto, The Renewer".  When Holst had written the original piece Pluto had not been discovered, and this addition therefore updated the suite and completed the eight [[movement (music)|movement]]s that represented the planets of the [[solar system]] (Earth was never included) some 80 years after it was originally performed.&lt;ref&gt;Andante.  December 2002.  "[http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=19430 Completing Holst's Cosmos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122065450/http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=19430 |date=22 November 2006 }}".  Accessed 26 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2006 Pluto was officially demoted to a [[dwarf planet]], meaning that Holst's original work now more accurately represents the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]].  24 August 2006.  "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5282440.stm Pluto loses status as a planet]".  Accessed 26 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some extremely famous 20th century [[opera]]s have been left incomplete at their composers' deaths. [[Giacomo Puccini]] left the finale of ''[[Turandot]]'' unfinished and the missing music had to be provided by [[Franco Alfano]] for the premiere in 1926. Recently, [[Luciano Berio]] composed an alternative ending. [[Alban Berg]] had only finished the first two acts of his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' at the time of his death in 1935. Due to objections from his widow it was not until 1979 that a full version was performed, with music for the final act devised by [[Friedrich Cerha]] using Berg's sketches.&lt;ref&gt;''Viking Opera Guide'', ed. Holden (Viking, 1994): articles on Puccini and Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other musical works which are unfinished but performable, are simply given in their incomplete state. Schubert's symphony is the most famous, but [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Bruckner)|Ninth Symphony]] is performed without a finale, and in [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]]'s ''[[Gesangsszene]]'', the final words of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s text, left unset at the composer's death, are simply spoken by the soloist.

Some other well-known examples of unfinished works completed by other hands include:
* [[Béla Bartók]]'s [[Viola Concerto (Bartók)|Viola Concerto]], completed by [[Tibor Serly]] and others
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)|Symphony No. 10]], completed by [[Barry Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]]
* [[Alexander Borodin]]'s opera ''[[Prince Igor]]'', completed by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]]
* [[Ernest Chausson]]'s [[String Quartet (Chausson)|String Quartet]], completed by [[Vincent d'Indy]]
* [[Claude Debussy]]'s opera ''[[Rodrigue et Chimène]]'', completed by [[Edison Denisov]]
* [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s opera ''[[Le duc d'Albe]]'', completed by [[Matteo Salvi]]
* [[Manuel de Falla]]'s opera ''[[Atlántida (opera)|Atlántida]]'', completed by [[Ernesto Halffter]]
* [[Fromental Halévy]]'s opera ''[[Noé (opera)|Noé]]'', completed by [[Georges Bizet]]
* [[Charles Ives]]' [[Universe Symphony (Ives)|Universe Symphony]], completed by various composers, including [[Larry Austin]]
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[Great Mass in C minor, K. 427|Great Mass in C minor]], completed in various versions, among which are those by [[Robert D. Levin]] and [[Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs]]
* [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'', completed in various versions by [[César Cui]], [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], [[Vissarion Shebalin]] and [[Emil Cooper]]
* Mussorgsky's opera ''[[Khovanshchina]]'', completed in versions by Rimsky-Korsakov; [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]] working together; and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]
* Mussorgsky's opera ''[[Zhenitba]]'', completed in various versions, including Rimsky-Korsakov, [[Aleksandr Gauk]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin]], [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]] and [[Vyacheslav Nagovitsyn]]
* [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s opera ''[[Maddalena (opera)|Maddalena]]'', completed by [[Edward Downes]]
* [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s opera ''[[La rondine]]'', completed by [[Lorenzo Ferrero]]
* [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s opera ''[[Lucrezia (opera)|Lucrezia]]'', completed by [[Elsa Respighi]]
* [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', third act written but never set to music
* [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 7]] and [[Symphony No. 10 (Schubert)|10]], completed by [[Brian Newbould]]
* [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s [[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]], of which the ''Prefatory Action'' was completed by [[Alexander Nemtin]]
* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 3 in E flat]], completed by [[Sergei Taneyev]]
** This work was originally intended to be a [[Symphony in E flat (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony in E flat]]; it would have been Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony had he not abandoned it (the work now known as his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6 in B minor, ''Pathétique'']] is a completely different work).  Tchaikovsky converted his sketches into a piano concerto, and in that form it was completed by Taneyev.  However, Semyon Bogatyrev took the original sketches and completed the symphony Tchaikovsky had first planned, publishing it as Tchaikovsky's "Symphony No. 7".
* [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s opera ''[[Die drei Pintos]]'', completed by [[Gustav Mahler]]

[[Peter Schickele]] parodied the concept in his "Unbegun Symphony," which contains only movements III and IV because, as Schickele put it, "I was born too late to write the first two movements."

====Modern recordings====
Since recording equipment has been an integral part of writing music it has been possible to use the original master tapes and [[demo (music)|demos]] to construct a song from the parts that had already been completed.  Many demos are released officially if the artist has been unable (or unwilling) to complete it, or made available as a [[bootleg recording]].  The continued popularity of [[the Beatles]] led to "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" being released in the mid-1990s after the band members pieced together incomplete recordings by the deceased [[John Lennon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Caroline.  [[Guardian Unlimited]], 21 November 1995.  "[https://www.theguardian.com/thebeatles/story/0,,606548,00.html Do they believe in yesterday?]".

[[File:Brian Wilson.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Wilson]] performing ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|Smile]]'' as a solo artist in 2005]]

[[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' is considered the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=63}}  Recorded in 1966 and 1967, ''Smile'' was to be the followup to the album  ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), but due to [[Brian Wilson]]'s deteriorating mental health and increased friction among the band members, the band abandoned the project after completing numerous recordings slated for the project.  In 2004, Wilson and writing partner [[Van Dyke Parks]] went into the studio, and newly recorded the material and released it as a completed solo album.

Other famous unfinished rock albums include [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Let It Be#Get Back albums|Get Back]]'', [[the Who]]'s [[rock opera]] ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'', and [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s ''[[First Rays of the New Rising Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=unt-unrel&gt;{{Citation |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |date=2015-04-13 |title=The Top Ten Unreleased Albums From the Mid-1960s Through the Early 1970s |publisher= |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/wordpress/the-top-ten-unreleased-albums-from-the-mid-1960s-through-the-early-1970s/ |accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All have been released, in whole or part, in various posthumous forms in the ensuing years,&lt;ref name=unt-unrel/&gt; ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' being another case of using demos in order to present a completed work.

Several artists have found that some of their studio work have been leaked onto the [[Internet]] before their album has been completed.  [[System of a Down]]'s 2002 follow-up to ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'', untitled at the time, was leaked onto the Internet as [[MP3]] files.  When the album was released under the title ''[[Steal This Album!]]'' the songs were significantly different from the work-in-progress, with different titles, lyrics and even melodies.  There were some reports that the changes were a direct result of negative feedback about the leaked material.&lt;ref&gt;Sputnikmusic.

Some artists will try to ensure that their work is completed (as much as possible) before their health prevents them from continuing.  [[Johnny Cash]], aware of his failing health, made sure that he recorded the vocals for 60 more songs, with the music being completed after his death.  These songs were compiled by producer [[Rick Rubin]] and released as ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' and ''[[American VI]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gundersen, Edna.  [[USA Today]], 1 May 2006.

Accessed 6 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not all artists get the chance to complete their work before their death, and the recordings that are made public may be somewhat different from what had originally been intended.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}  ''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]'' by [[Elliott Smith]] was released posthumously in 2004 with comments from the initial album producer saying that "[t]he record he would have delivered would [have] had more songs, would have had different mixes and [been] a little more in your face".&lt;ref&gt;Confabulators.

[[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] released several tracks decades after his sister Karen died in 1983, leaving a multitude of unfinished work. One track, released on the "Interpretations" album in the mid-nineties, included Karen's lead vocal for the song "[[Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again]]" which had previously been recorded and released by [[Barry Manilow]]. The lead had been lost for years on a mislabelled tape. Strings, piano, and backup singers were added to the sound of Karen's lead vocal, while Richard left the sound of her turning the lead sheet over in the finished product. Another track was Karen's cover "[[The Rainbow Connection]]", which had been written by [[Kenny Ascher]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] for [[Jim Henson]] to sing as [[Kermit The Frog]] in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979). Recording it only a year later, Richard claims that Karen just did not like the song and that was why it was omitted from their 1981 album, ''[[Made in America (Carpenters album)|Made In America]]''. A toy piano, choir, and strings were added against Karen's vocals. The song was released in 2001 on the album ''[[As Time Goes By (Carpenters album)|As Time Goes By]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Film===
[[File:Orson Welles 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Orson Welles]] left behind numerous unfinished films.]]
[[Film]]s may not be completed for several reasons, with some being shelved during different stages of the production. ''[[Arrive Alive]]'' was scrapped after a week of filming when the comedy was not living up to the screenplay. Shelving a film without it ever being released can be very expensive for the studios, with ''Arrive Alive'' costing $7 million.

With so many people involved in [[filmmaking]] it is very possible for a film to remain incomplete because of an injury or death. While a member of the crew (even a [[film producer|producer]] or [[film director|director]]) can often be replaced, it is much more difficult to change to a different [[actor]] if many of the scenes have already been filmed. For example, ''[[Dark Blood]]'' was cancelled halfway through filming due to the death of its star [[River Phoenix]]; however, the film premiered to a private guest audience on September 27, 2012 at the Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht, Netherlands. Some films have been completed despite such problems. A famous example is [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Game of Death]]''; Lee died during the filming and the rest of the filming was finished by [[Tai Chung Kim]], a Lee look-alike; and [[Yuen Biao]], a then-stunt actor who later became a TV/movie actor. His son, [[Brandon Lee]], also suffered from the same fate: he died after filming most of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', but the remaining scenes were played by [[stunt double]] [[Chad Stahelski]] with Lee's face digitally composited onto the double.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban Legends Reference Pages]]. 7 December 1997. "[http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/brandlee.htm Brandon Lee]". Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued delays can prevent a film from ever being completed. ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' was a [[1962 in film|1962 film]] with a difficult production history, which included the firing of leading lady [[Marilyn Monroe]]. She was later rehired but died before filming started; without the delay the film might have been completed.&lt;ref&gt;CoverUps.com. "[http://www.coverups.com/monroe/countdown.htm Marilyn Monroe's Death, Countdown To Tragedy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820043058/http://www.coverups.com/monroe/countdown.htm |date=20 August 2006 }}".

In [[Orson Welles]]' lifetime his unfinished films became legendary. For decades he worked on a version of ''[[Don Quixote (unfinished film)|Don Quixote]]'', and he claimed that the film could be finished despite the deaths of his two leading actors.&lt;ref&gt;"The Orson Welles Story", ''Arena'', BBC TV 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' remains one of the only films that was released as Welles intended, with most of his other films remaining incomplete or being changed by the studios. His death on 10 October 1985 came while he was working on ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Dreamers (unfinished film)|The Dreamers]]'', the former being completed.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrelli, Paolo. 22 May 2006.

[[Animation|Animated films]], though less vulnerable to problems such as the death of an actor, can still fail to be completed. ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'' was a twenty-six-year [[animation|animated film]] project by [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] which was taken away from him and completed by [[Fred Calvert]].&lt;ref&gt;Briney, Daniel. 21 August 2001.

Accessed 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[workprint]] of the original film became available as a bootleg, and there have been several attempts to restore the film, most notably Garrett Gilchrist's "Recobbled" cut. The 1978 animated adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was not viewed by the studio as enough of a commercial success to warrant the funding of a sequel, thus not completing the story from the original trilogy of books.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Connor.

===Software===
Computer [[software]], particularly [[computer and video games|games]], are sometimes cancelled quite far into their [[software engineering|development]]. Occasionally they are demonstrated to the press so that [[Technical preview|preview]]s can be written but are never completed or published. ''[[Amen: The Awakening]]'' had an extensive preview written in the magazine ''PC Paradox'' in 1999, including numerous [[screenshot]]s, which generated a lot of interest in the project. However, it was cancelled the following year.&lt;ref&gt;PlanetPhillip. 18 August 2004. "[http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/amen-the-awakening/ Amen: The Awakening] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016152052/http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/amen-the-awakening/ |date=16 October 2006 }}". Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to continued interest in a game, some are eventually made available in their unfinished state. ''[[Combat 2]]'', the sequel to the 1977 [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]]-bundled game ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'', was never completed, but many years later, at the 2001 [[Classic Gaming Expo]], 200 copies of the unfinished game were sold after a company created a box and manual.&lt;ref&gt;AtariAge. "[http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=1137 Combat Two]". Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software undergoes a [[software testing|testing phase]] that helps to eliminate problems before it is released; however, [[development stage|beta testing]] is a form of testing where the software is open to the public (usually limited to a set number of people or organisations) but is still essentially unfinished. This is often an important part of the development of a software package.

If a piece of software is becoming overly delayed the developer may just release the program despite the presence of a few [[software bug|bugs]]. The Internet has allowed [[patch (computing)|patch]]es to be deployed that fix these bugs, but before such technology was available the problems could not be fixed after the game was published. Even with this, a game with too many bugs when it is made public will receive very poor reviews that will undoubtedly affect sales. For example, 2002's ''[[Destroyer Command]]'' received some very positive reviews about many aspects of the game but was criticised for the number of glitches it contained that, given a lengthier software testing phase, should have been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Metacritic. "[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/destroyercommand Destroyer Command]". Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers choose to disable certain features in order to release the game on time, especially if a project has seen an amount of [[feature creep]]. One such title was [[Cinemaware]]'s ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'', which was released before all the features were completed when the company was faced with a strict deadline and the loss of two programmers.&lt;ref&gt;Hall Of Light.

==In law==
Unfinished work is often covered by the [[copyright]] laws of the country of origin.  The [[United States]] have taken the step of creating a law which specifically mentions ongoing work, whereby work which is in progress but will in the future be completed can be covered by copyright.  On 27 April 2005 the "Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act", a subpart of the [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act]], was signed into U.S. law.  This act allows for organisations or individuals to apply for copyright protection on unfinished commercial products, such as [[software]], films, and other visual or audible media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Center for Democracy and Technology]].  April 2005.  {{cite web|url= http://www.cdt.org/copyright/20050426s167analysis.pdf |title=Analysis of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 (S. 167) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(74.1&amp;nbsp;KB)}} .  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a [[photographer]] can preregister a photograph by giving a written description of what the final piece (or collection thereof) will look like before the work is finished.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Daryl.  14 November 2005.

In copyright law, an artistic creation that includes major, basic copyrighted aspects of an original, previously created first work is known as a '[[derivative work]]'.  This holds for all kinds of work, including those that have never officially been published.  The rights of the first work's originator must be granted to the secondary work for it to be rightfully called a 'derivative work'.  If no copyright permission is granted from the originator, it is instead called a 'copy'.  Upon completion of the new piece both parties hold a joint copyright status, with both having to agree to any publications.
