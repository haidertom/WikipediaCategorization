The '''2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting''' resulted in the deaths of two people and injuries to at least fifteen others at the Tel Aviv branch of the [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Israeli LGBT Association]], at the "Bar-Noar" ({{lang-he|ברנוער}}, "Youth Bar"), on Nahmani Street in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]], on 1 August 2009. A 26-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were killed.&lt;ref name="Hunt still on for TA gay center shooter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1248277947570&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Hunt still on for TA gay center shooter |date=2 August 2009 |publisher=''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; Three deaths were mentioned in earlier reports of the incident but one has since been discounted.&lt;ref name="Police hunt killer of Israel gays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8180173.stm|title=Police hunt killer of Israel gays|date=2 August 2009|publisher=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802100413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8180173.stm|archivedate=2 August 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three killed in Tel Aviv shooting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/middle-east/three-killed-in-tel-aviv-shooting-1849435.html|title=Three killed in Tel Aviv shooting|date=2 August 2009|publisher=independent.ie|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the injured were minors;&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; six were in serious condition. The city was subject to a "clampdown" after the attacks, and several hundred police launched a manhunt to locate the killer(s).&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills 2 at Tel Aviv club for gay youths"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5701V520090801|title=Gunman kills 2 at Tel Aviv club for gay youths|date=2009-08-02|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Hagai Felician was charged over the murder, but the Police retracted its allegations in March 2014, after revealing its key witness fabricated evidence.&lt;ref name="HF"/&gt;   

The shooting sparked widespread condemnation, with one lawmaker calling it the worst attack against the gay community in Israel's history. The location of the attack—at the heart of what is seen as Israel's most liberal city— resulted in protests by the gay community.&lt;ref name="Gay group killings prompt Israeli protests"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5701V520090802|title=Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the police had yet to apprehend the shooter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/prison-allows-homosexual-conjugal-visit-for-first-time/ Israeli prison allows homosexual conjugal visit for first time], 25 April 2017 Sue Surkes, Times of Israel&lt;/ref&gt;
==Shooting==
[[File:Tel Aviv gay center shooting memorial.jpg|thumb|Cactus and Succulent plants memorial garden, near the gay center of Tel Aviv, in memory of Liz Troubishi and Nir Katz,  murdered  in the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting. The plants were donated from the private garden of Eli Troubishi, Liz's father]]
On the evening of August 1 at around 23:00, an unknown person with firearms entered the [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Aguda]] building in [[Tel Aviv]], opened fire on the crowd attending a "Youth Get Together" event, and immediately escaped by foot. Two people were killed, and fifteen were wounded. Police launched a search campaign to find the shooter, and in addition immediately closed most entertainment locations for the gay community that operated during the same time of the shooting for fear of additional shooting.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;

The building was frequented by gay teenagers who engaged in social activities and listened to music.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt; The centre was small with one terrace, thus preventing anyone from escaping. Attendees instead hid under a bed and tables as shots were fired.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt; Israeli television said the crime scene was a "bloodbath".&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt; Five of the injured were treated at [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]], while five were treated at [[Wolfson Medical Center]] in [[Holon]].&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104624.html|title=Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooter was masked, dressed in black and used a pistol to carry out the attack.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills 2 at Tel Aviv club for gay youths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pistol"/&gt; It was not believed his motive was related to nationalist terrorism.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; The city's gay community stated the killer had a homophobic motive, while police criticized them for rushing to make declarations about incitement being the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/police-source-we-have-lead-in-gay-lesbian-center-killings-1.281263]&lt;/ref&gt; Police were also investigating leads that the attack may have been due to a personal feud.&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1105047.html 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting report], ''Haaretz''; accessed 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manhunt===
A manhunt was immediately launched in an attempt to locate the gunman.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; Roadblocks were set up in the city.&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-israel-shooting2-2009aug02,0,1458101.story|title=Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=chicagotribune.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074147/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-israel-shooting2-2009aug02,0,1458101.story|archive-date=2009-08-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police shut down all other gay clubs and buildings that had homosexual connections near the crime scene immediately after the shooting in case there were further attacks.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104506.html|title=Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt; Hundreds of police officers were conducting street and door-to-door searches in the city.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;

Police soon discarded the possibility that the shooting was a terror attack.&lt;ref name="pistol"&gt;{{Citation|last=Boudreaux|first=Richard|title=Israeli gays left feeling vulnerable|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publication-place=Los Angeles, California|date=3 August 2009|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/03/world/fg-israel-attack3| accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reenactment===
Police in Tel Aviv accompanied a teenaged survivor of the attack to the basement to conduct a reenactment on 3 August 2009.&lt;ref name="Police conduct reenactment of Tel Aviv gay attack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418522966&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Police conduct reenactment of Tel Aviv gay attack |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=5 August 2009 |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
The dead were named as 26-year-old Nir Katz from [[Givatayim]] and 17-year-old Liz Troubishi from [[Holon]]. One 16-year-old victim spoke of his fear that the shooting would cause an effect of enforced [[Coming out|outing]] as parents find out their children are gay for the first time.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;

==Hagai Felician case==
Following a police investigation lasting nearly four years, three suspects were arrested. Their arrests were announced on 5 June 2013. A [[gag order]] was placed on the details of the investigation. The three suspects, all residents of [[Pardes Katz]], a neighborhood in [[Bnei Brak]], ranged in ages from 20 to 40. It was later announced that a prominent activist in the Israeli LGBT community had also been detained for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Senyor. [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4388862,00.html Investigation into 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting], ynetnews.com; accessed 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jerusalem Post'' reported that the shooting was planned by two young men, one of whom believed his teenaged relative had been abused by an activist at the Bar-Noar center. After the shooting, the gunman and his accomplice fled into Tel Aviv. The pistol used by the killer was found by hikers in December 2012 and the suspects were arrested some months later.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hartman.

On 11 June, the gag order was officially lifted. According to police, a few months before the killings, one of the suspects, then 15 years old, came to Barnoar struggling with his sexual identity. There he met with a veteran Barnoar figure, the fourth person to be arrested in the case. Hagai Felician, the teenager's relative, became aware that the teen had been seen a few times at Barnoar, and asked him what he was doing there. The teenager confirmed he had been going there, but that he was raped by the senior figure at the club. Felician allegedly decided to take matters into his own hands, and together with another suspect, Tarlan Hankishayev, and the state's witness, plotted to harm the activist. On the day of the shooting, Felician allegedly came to Barnoar looking for the activist. Unable to find him, Felician “lost it” and shot those present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/tel-aviv-gay-youth-center-attackers-sought-revenge-over-rape-of-teen-police-reveal.premium-1.529071|title=Tel Aviv gay youth center attackers sought revenge over rape of teen, police reveal|work=Haaretz.com|first=Yaniv|last=Kubovich|date=11 June 2013|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 June 2013, charges were dropped against the other two suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Murder-charges-dropped-against-two-Bar-Noar-suspects-317473]&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 2013, Hagai Felician was indicted on two counts of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/hagai-felician-indicted-bar-noar_n_3570891.html|title=Hagai Felician Indicted On 2 Counts of Murder in Tel Aviv Gay Center Shooting Case|work=The Huffington Post|first=Stuart|last=Hunter|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the prosecution's case against Hagai Felician collapsed after new information was uncovered that suggested that the state witness around whose testimony the case had been built had lied. Subsequently, the witness, who was identified in media reports as "Z" due to his identity being under gag order, was arrested on charges of fabricating evidence. On 26 February, Felician was released, although he was remanded to house arrest until 2 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Suspect-in-LGBT-murder-case-Felician-released-to-house-arrest-343638 Bar Noar double murder suspect Hagai Felician released after collapse of state case]&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March 2014, all charges against Felician were dropped.&lt;ref name="HF"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/charges-dropped-against-gay-youth-club-murder-suspect Charges dropped against gay youth club murder suspect], timesofisrael.com; accessed 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yaakov Felician rape case===
On 24 June 2013, it was cleared for publication that Felician's brother, Yaakov, had been arrested on rape charges, and was suspected of raping a female attorney who had applied to serve as part of Hagai's defense team. Under police interrogation, Yaakov Felician claimed that the attorney had only filed a rape complaint after he did not hire her to serve on his brother's defense team. He was released to house arrest after a [[polygraph]] test determined he was being truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relative of Bar Noar suspect accused of rape |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/relative-of-bar-noar-suspect-accused-of-rape |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HtqCpOU3?url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/relative-of-bar-noar-suspect-accused-of-rape/ |archivedate= 6 July 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=1 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4398534,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Brother-of-chief-suspect-in-Bar-Noar-case-arrested-for-rape-317557 "Brother of chief suspect in Bar Noar case arrested for rape"], jpost.com; accessed 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political reaction===
The murderous event was broadly covered by the Israeli media, and was widely condemned by many public figures. President [[Shimon Peres]] reacted to the murder, stating that: "The horrifying murder that was carried out yesterday in Tel Aviv, against teenagers and young people, is a murder that civilized and enlightened people cannot accept. Murder and hatred are the two most serious crimes in society. The police must exert great efforts in order to catch the despicable murderer, and the entire nation must unite in condemning this abominable act." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3755617,00.html Peres: Enlightened nation cannot accept TA shooting], [[Yediot Ahronot]], 2 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104611.html|title=Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peres called the culprit a "lowly criminal" and urged the police to apprehend him quickly.&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt; 

[[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] also condemned the murder at the opening of his Cabinet meeting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3755571,00.html Netanyahu: Israel a country of tolerance], [[Yediot Ahronot]], 2 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed his "shock and dismay", condemning the "shocking murder" and reminding Israeli citizens that "we are a democratic and tolerant country and we must respect every person as he is".&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0802/israel.html|title=Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

[[Nitzan Horowitz]], the only openly gay member of the [[Knesset]] at the time, condemned it as "the worst attack ever against the gay community in Israel [...] a blind attack against innocent youths.&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

The [[Shas]] party said they were "shocked and bereaved, and denounce without reservation the murderous incident". Public Security Minister [[Yitzhak Aharonovich]], head of Israel's police force, called it "a serious and grave incident". Aharonovitch spoke of going to the crime scene, saying "it was a difficult sight".&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

Opposition leader [[Tzipi Livni]] called it a "grave incident", saying "even if all the details surrounding the event are not yet clear, the hatred exists and must be dealt with".&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt; She said it should "awaken society to rid itself of prejudice" and "shake up society, and all the circles inherent in it, including the political establishment and the education system, and on this day deliver an unequivocal message against intolerance, incitement and violence, and to act against any manifestation of these".&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

The Mayor of Tel Aviv, [[Ron Huldai]], said his city would still welcome members of the gay and lesbian community, saying they would fight for their rights to live.&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"/&gt; Tel Aviv's Head of Police, Shachar Ayalon, did not say the shooting was a hate crime.&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;

On 8 August, days after the event, Peres came to the crime scene at Bar-Noar to show support for the community and the deadly attack on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3757975,00.html "Netanyahu visits Tel Aviv gay center"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5j5LVuvg9?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3757975,00.html |date=2009-08-17 }}, ''[[Yediot Ahronot]]'', 8 August 2009; accessed 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5j5LVuvg9?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3757975,00.html Archived records]; 16 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2009, a cousin of Nir Katz&amp;nbsp;— together with the Vancouver Hillel Foundation&amp;nbsp;— organized a candlelight vigil in honour of the victims at the Vancouver Art Gallery in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. The evening's service drew about 100 people and served as a rally against hate crime. This vigil also served to mark ''Shloshim'', which in the Jewish tradition is a service to mark the end of the 30-day mourning period following the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Jewish Independent Online |url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/Sept09/archives09Sept04-02.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jq7jLpLh?url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/Sept09/archives09Sept04-02.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=14 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A video recording of this vigil can be found on youtube.com under the title "Vancouver Vigil&amp;nbsp;— In Memory of Nir Katz (1983-2009) Parts 1 through 5".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=YouTube&amp;nbsp;— Vancouver Vigil&amp;nbsp;— In Memory of Nir Katz (1983-2009), part 1/5 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI8QWgIiiKU |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jq7jgcdK?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI8QWgIiiKU |archivedate=16 September 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=14 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate vigil was held in [[Toronto]].

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was one of the first countries in the Balkans to adopt the  Freedom of Access to Information Act, at the State level in 2000, and then in 2001 in both of its entities, namely the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]]. However, according to some experts the law requires changes to address a series of shortcomings that have been identified over the years.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher=Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |issue=|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Analitika&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=December 2013 |title=Towards Proactive Transparency in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=http://www.analitika.ba/sites/default/files/publikacije/proaktivna_transparentnost_policy_memo_eng_4juni_web.pdf  |publisher=Analitika. Centre for Social Research |issue= Policy Memo |access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Due to the specific circumstances and the way in which it was created, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, annex IV of [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Agreement]] did not pay much attention to the right to information.&lt;ref name=Internews&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mehmed HALILOVIĆ and Amer DŽIHANA |date=2012 |title=Media Law in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=http://www.internews.ba/sites/default/files/attachments/Media%20law%20in%20BiH%20eng.pdf |publisher=Internews in Bosnia and Herzegovina |access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of freedom of information legislation was initiated with a decision of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] in 1999. The Decision asked the State and the Entities to adopt such a legislation. The consultation process for drafting the law involved the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)]]’s legal experts and extensive public discussions with citizens and civil society groups. The Act was adopted by the Bosnia and Herzegovina State Government in October 2000, and the Republika Srpska Government in May 2001.&lt;ref name=OSCE2001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/bih/53670 |title=Freedom of Access to information Law fully adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina  |last= |first= |date=26 June 2001 |website=Osce.org |publisher= Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
The laws establish a general right of the public to access the information held by public authorities/organs “to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest”. Therefore, the laws establish a general obligation of making all relevant information public, except for some cases falling under the exceptions defined by the law.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Access to public information applies to information held by all public organs (legislative, judiciary, executive and administrative) and regardless of their format (written documents, digital data, audio or video records, etc.) as well as to legal persons owner or controlled by public bodies, such as public enterprises, public schools, universities, state agencies, etc. On the contrary, it does not apply to private organisations, private companies and the commercial sector.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The laws entitle every person, regardless of his or her citizenship, nationality, ethnicity, or place of residence, the right to access to public information. Journalists and media outlet do not have more rights compared with other requesters.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The prescribed period of time for obtaining the requested information is 15 days from the submission of the request.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Under the FOI laws, public authorities are both obliged to provide access to documents and records and to publish the most important information without a request ([[proactive disclosure]]). Rules for proactive publication apply to information on institutions’ budget, regular activities and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

===Exceptions===
In line with international standards, access to information laws in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Republika Srpska establish that in some cases public information can be withheld on a legal basis. Specifically, three cases of exceptions are foreseen: first, when there is the possibility that disclosing information can cause a significant damage to legitimate functions of the government (national security, defence, monetary policy issues, prevention of crime, etc.); second, the exceptions can be applied to protect commercial interests; and, third, to protect personal interests and privacy of a third party.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The application of these exceptions is not automatic: in effect, in order to reject the application on the basis of the exceptions established in the law, authorities have to make the [[public interest test]], meaning considering whether and how the disclosure of information is harming other protected interests.The public interest test is inspired by the most advanced international standards on the right of access to public information. Compared with similar laws in the [[Western Balkans]], only the laws of [[Access to public information in Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Access to public information in Croatia|Croatia]] prescribe such a test.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Exceptions are applied only after a case-by-case analysis of every case and specific circumstances related to each request. Labeling a whole category of information as exemption is forbidden.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

In Bosnia and Herzegovina some NGOs contribute to enforce the law on access to public information as well as to monitor its application and collect relevant data through the submission of FOI requests and the start of appeal procedures. This is the case, for instance, of the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), [[Transparency International]] (Bosnia and Herzegovina), or the Sarajevo-based [[Center for Investigative Journalism (CIN)]].&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Il-difficile-accesso-alle-informazioni-in-Bosnia-Erzegovina-177818 |title=Il difficile accesso alle informazioni in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last=Mišeljić |first=Ljupko |date=16 February 2017|website=Balcanicaucaso.org|publisher= Media Centar Sarajevo/Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|access-date=16 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report prepared by the [[Association of journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the country’s Press Council, the vast majority of Bosnians (around 93%) believe that there are several limitations to the right of access to public information in practice.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13562/  |title=Media Freedom in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last= |first= |date=2016 |website=Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Programme South East Europe |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same, public opinion in Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely not fully aware of their rights with regard to access to public information.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

When it comes to the application of the law, problems range from inconsistent interpretation of the law by different public bodies, unwillingness to apply it, to non-harmonisation of FOI laws with other laws.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;

Specifically, one of the major deficiency of freedom of information laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the weakness of the provisions concerning the appeal procedures in case the request is rejected. The FOI law of the Republika Srpska does not stipulate an appeal procedure at all.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Another problem concerns the lack of compliance with other existing laws that exclude or significantly reduce the right to free access to information in practice both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Also, experts have identified among the shortcomings hindering the application of FOI laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina the lack of an effective system for monitoring their application. Only a small number of public bodies comply with the obligation to publish the information on the number of received questions related to freedom of information on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

In 2013-16 in order to test the implementation of FOI laws, the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN) submitted a series of requests for accessing documents to different public bodies in the country at all level. Half of BIRN’s requests for information were rejected, while the remaining 50 per cent were only partially granted.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

Also, according to [[Transparency International]] - Bosnia and Herzegovina only 40% of public enterprises in Republika Srpska and 27% in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides the requested information within the timeframe established by the law. In 37% of cases examined by Transparency International the fulfillment of the procedure lasts more than one month, even if the law stipulates that the information requested must be provided in maximum 15 days.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

==Early life==
Jones was born in 1974 in [[Dallas, Texas]], and grew up in the Dallas suburb of [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]] and the city of [[Austin, Texas]]. His father is a dentist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlie|last=Warzel|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/alex-jones-will-never-stop-being-alex-jones|title=Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|publisher=Buzzfeed Inc.|location=New York|date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother a [[Homemaking|homemaker]].&lt;ref name="MeetAJ"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchik|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|title=Meet Alex Jones, the Talk Radio Host Behind Charlie Sheen's Crazy Rants|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329052117/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|archivedate=March 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his video podcasts, he reports he is of Irish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpO5elD3Gs|title = Baltimore City Councilman Pushes Racial Division|date = April 29, 2015|accessdate = April 30, 2015|publisher = YouTube, Google|author = The Alex Jones Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; German, Welsh, mostly English, and partially Native American descent. He was a lineman on his high school's football team and graduated from [[Anderson High School (Texas)|Anderson High School]] in Austin in 1993.&lt;ref name="MeetAJ"/&gt; As a teenager, he read conservative [[journalist]] and conspiracy theorist [[Gary Allen]]'s [[anti-Semitic]] book ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'',&lt;ref name="JTABook"&gt;{{cite news |last1=(Staff writer) |title=Congressman Won't Comment on Endorsement of Anti-semitic Book |url=https://www.jta.org/1972/06/16/archive/congressman-wont-comment-on-endorsement-of-anti-semitic-book |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |work=Daily News Bulletin |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |issue=117 |date=June 16, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a profound influence on him and which he calls "the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order".&lt;ref name="RollingStonepage3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchek|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meet-alex-jones-175845/|title=Meet Alex Jones|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Jones briefly attended [[Austin Community College District|Austin Community College]] but dropped out.&lt;ref name= Stern&gt;Howard Stern Radio Show, February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jones began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format [[public-access television|public-access]] [[cable television]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infowars.com/about-alex-jones/|title=About Alex Jones|work=Infowars}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Jones switched format to radio, hosting a show named ''The Final Edition'' on [[KUTX|KJFK]] (98.9 FM).&lt;ref name="KJFK"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lee|last=Nichols|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:75039|title=Psst, It's a Conspiracy: KJFK Gives Alex Jones the Boot Media Clips|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|location=Austin, Texas|date=December 10, 1999|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Paul]] was running for Congress and was a guest on his show several times.&lt;ref name="NYMagpage2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/media/alex-jones-2011-4/index1.html|title=How Radio Host Alex Jones Has Cornered the Bipartisan Paranoia Market|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] happened in 1995 Jones began accusing the government of being responsible, saying, "I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control".&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt; In 1998, he released his first film, ''America Destroyed By Design''.

In 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]] church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government's [[Waco siege|siege]] of the original Branch Davidian complex near [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Connie|last=Mabin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/branch-davidians-hope-a-new-church-can-close-wounds-719121.html |title=Branch Davidians hope a new church can close wounds |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London |date=April 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often featured the project on his public-access television program and claimed that [[David Koresh]] and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] during the siege.&lt;ref name="KJFK" /&gt; In the same year, he was removed from a [[George W. Bush]] rally at [[Bayport Industrial District]], Texas. Jones interrupted [[Governor of Texas|governor]] Bush's speech, demanding that the [[Federal Reserve]] and [[Council on Foreign Relations]] be abolished. Journalist [[David Weigel]], reporting on the incident, said Jones "seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David|last=Wiegel|title=Alex Jones celebrates Trump's takeover of the GOP |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/18/alex-jones-celebrates-trumps-takeover-of-the-gop/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington, DC|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Jones tied with [[Shannon Burke Show|Shannon Burke]] for that year's "Best Austin Talk Radio Host" poll, as voted by ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of Austin 1999 Readers Poll|date=1999|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin/?BOACategory=Media&amp;Year=1999&amp;Poll=Readers&amp;Display=Long|accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. His views were making the show hard to sell to advertisers, according to the station's operations manager.&lt;ref name="KJFK"/&gt; Jones stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;It was purely political, and it came down from on high&amp;nbsp;...

In 2001, his show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack]], Jones began to speak of a conspiracy by the Bush administration as being behind the attack,&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt; which caused a number of the stations that had previously carried him to drop his program, according to Will Bunch.&lt;ref name="Bunch2011"/&gt;

On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the [[Bilderberg Group]] in [[Ottawa]], Jones was stopped and detained at the [[Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport|Ottawa airport]] by Canadian authorities who confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada lawfully. Jones said about the reason for his immigration hold, "I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payton |first=Laura |title=Bilderberg-bound filmmaker held at airport |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=June 8, 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919 |accessdate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011102348/http://canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2016, following the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], Jones and [[Roger Stone]] began plotting the removal of [[Ted Cruz]] from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate, with potential challengers [[Katrina Pierson]] and [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]] mooted as replacements in the upcoming [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|Texas election for Senate]] in 2018.&lt;ref name=plotprimary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/288719-roger-stone-alex-jones-plot-primary-challenge-to-cruz|title=Roger Stone, Alex Jones plot primary challenge to Cruz|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|last=Easley|first=Jonathan|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2017, alongside [[Paul Joseph Watson]], Jones began hosting a contest to create the best "CNN Meme", in which the winner would receive $20,000.

=== Sexual harassment and antisemitism claims ===
In February 2018, Jones was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment of males and females.

==Radio, websites and mail-order business {{anchor|Infowars}}==
''The Alex Jones Show'' is broadcast nationally by the [[Genesis Communications Network]] to more than 90 AM and FM radio stations in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gcnlive.com | title=GCNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[WWCR]], a [[shortwave radio]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwcr.com/pgm-links.html | title=WWCR Programming Schedule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday show also airs on [[KLBJ (AM)|KLBJ]].

According to journalist Will Bunch, a senior fellow at [[Media Matters for America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/author/will-bunch | title=Will Bunch | publisher=CommonDreams | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/will-bunch/ | title=Will Bunch | work=The Huffington Post | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show has a demographic heavier in younger viewers than other conservative pundits due to Jones's "highly conspiratorial tone and Web-oriented approach". Bunch has also stated that Jones "feed[s] on the deepest paranoia".&lt;ref name="Bunch2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunch|first=Will|title=The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEAb7Pv-a0C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=January 10, 2013|date=September 13, 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061991721|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Zaitchik of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in 2011 he had a larger on-line audience than [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] combined.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt;

=== Infowars and other sites ===
[[File:Infowars Logo with Natural Earth Map Background.svg|alt=|thumb|Infowars.com logo]]
{{Main|InfoWars}}
Jones is the publisher and director of the Infowars.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infowars.com/contact/|title=Contact " Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!|website=www.infowars.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Infowars'' website receives approximately 10 million monthly visits, making its reach more extensive than mainstream news websites such as ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantcast.com/infowars.com?qcLocale=en_US#trafficCard|title=Infowars.com Audience Insights – Quantcast|website=www.quantcast.com|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/28/13424848/alex-jones-infowars-prisonplanet|title=Alex Jones, Pizzagate booster and America's most famous conspiracy theorist, explained|work=Vox|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:News Wars Logo.svg|thumb|Newswars logo]]
In August 2017, Jones announced the launch of NewsWars.com, a site Jones said was intended to battle news that he considers to be fake news.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Beth|last=Baumann|url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/12/infowars-alex-jones-launches-new-website-aimed-at-exposing-fake-news|title=InfoWars' Alex Jones launches new website aimed at exposing 'fake news'|website=[[TheBlaze]]|publisher=[[Mercury Radio Arts]]|location=Irving, Texas|date=August 12, 2017|access-date=February 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones also operates the PrisonPlanet.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roig-Franzia|first=Manuel|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/alex-jones-conspiracy-donald-trump-us-election-infowars-prisonplanet-a7429461.html|title=How Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist extraordinaire, got Donald Trump’s ear|work=The Independent|date=November 21, 2016|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer products===
A 2017 piece for German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' by Veit Medick indicated that two-thirds of Jones' funds derive from sales of a successful range of his own products. These products are marketed through the ''Infowars'' website and through advertising spots on Jones' show.  They include dietary supplements, toothpaste, bulletproof vests and "brain pills," which hold "an appeal for anyone who believes [[Armageddon]] is near", according to Medick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Veit|last=Medick|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-visit-to-the-infowars-studios-of-alex-jones-a-1136654.html|title=Meet Donald Trump's Propagandist|magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=Spiegel-Verlag|location=Hamburg, Germany|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Californian medical company [[Labdoor, Inc]] reported on tests applied to six of Jones' dietary supplement products.  These included a product named Survival Shield, which was found by Labdoor to contain only [[iodine]], and a product named Oxy-Powder, which comprised a compound of magnesium oxide and citric acid; common ingredients in dietary supplements.  Labdoor indicated no evidence of prohibited or harmful substances, but cast doubt on Infowars' marketing claims for these products, and asserted that the quantity of the ingredients in certain products would be "too low to be appropriately effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://labdoor.com/article/labdoor-special-report-we-tested-the-infowars-supplements|title=Labdoor Special Report: We Tested the Infowars Supplements|date=August 10, 2017|publisher=Labdoor Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/we-sent-alex-jones-infowars-supplements-to-a-lab-heres|title=We Sent Alex Jones' Infowars Supplements To A Lab.

On a segment of ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', host [[John Oliver]] stated that Jones spends "nearly a quarter" of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website, many of which are purported solutions to medical and economic problems claimed to be caused by the conspiracy theories described on his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locker|first1=Melissa|title=John Oliver Goes to War with Alex Jones on 'Last Week Tonight'|url=http://time.com/4880191/john-oliver-alex-jones-last-week-tonight/|accessdate=August 2, 2017|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Today in Entertainment: Twitter has a field day over Anthony Scaramucci's exit; Celebrities mourn the loss of Sam Shepard|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-john-oliver-mocks-alex-jones-products-1501509845-htmlstory.html|accessdate=August 4, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Jones has been the center of many controversies.

===School shootings===
Jones has been criticized for propagating conspiracy theories about the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in 2012 and the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in 2018 being false flag operations engineered by gun control advocates.

On June 9, 2013, Jones appeared as a guest on the [[BBC]]'s television show ''[[Daily Politics|Sunday Politics]]'', during a discussion about conspiracy theories surrounding the [[Bilderberg Group]] meetings with presenter [[Andrew Neil]] and journalist [[David Aaronovitch]]. A critic of such theories, Aaronovitch implied that, since Jones had not been killed for exposing conspiracies, they either do not exist or that Jones is a part of them himself.

===Relationship with Donald Trump===

'''Analogical models''' are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the "target system" by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called '''dynamical analogies'''.

Two [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] have ''analog'' representations (see illustration) if they are [[black box]] [[isomorphism#Applications|isomorphic systems]].

== Explanation ==

[[Analogy|Analogizing]] is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system). A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called "analog" or "analogue" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[knowledge]] of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p.&amp;nbsp;1-3).

{{cquote|dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical, mechanical, acoustical, magnetic and electronic systems}} (Olson 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;2).

For example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use [[voltage]] to represent an arithmetic quantity; [[operational amplifier]]s might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of [[calibration]] these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a ''one-to-one correspondence in behaviour'' between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one.
&lt;!--This doesn't seem right. Is the "model" the "target system" or the "analogue/source system"? It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh!--&gt;

==Creating an analogical model==

Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the Phillips Hydraulic Computer [[MONIAC]] used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of [[simulation]].
&lt;!-- EXAMPLES! WE NEED EXAMPLES! --&gt;

==Mechanical analogies==
{{Main|Mechanical-electrical analogies}}
Any number of systems could be used for mapping electrical phenomena to mechanical phenomena, but two principle systems are commonly used: the [[impedance analogy]] and the [[mobility analogy]]. The impedance analogy maps force to voltage whereas the mobility analogy maps force to current.

The impedance analogy preserves the analogy between [[electrical impedance]] and [[mechanical impedance]] but does not preserve the network topology. The mobility analogy preserves the network topology but does not preserve the analogy between impedances. Both preserve the correct energy and power relationships by making [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|power conjugate pairs]] of variables analogous.

==Hydraulic analogy==
*In a [[hydraulic analogy]], a [[water integrator]] might perform the mathematical operation of [[integral|integration]].

==Physiological analogies==
*[[Francis Crick]] used the study of the [[visual system]] as a proxy for the study of [[awareness]].

==Formal analogies==
&lt;!--Needs to be filled--&gt;
*"The same [[equation]]s have the same [[solution]]s." -- [[Richard Feynman]]
**For example, the inverse-square laws of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis, almost without regard to the physical details about [[mass]]es and [[charge (physics)|charges]].
**In [[population ecology]], [[differential equation]]s arise that are the same as those found in [[mechanics]], albeit with different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg and Colyvan 2004; Colyvan and Ginzburg 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recursion]] requires a similarity within a situation; for example, [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] to count the [[The Sand Reckoner|number of grains of sand on a beach]] by using the concept of myriad myriads.

==Dynamical analogies==
Dynamical analogies establish analogies between systems in different energy domains by means of comparison of the system dynamic equations. There are many ways such analogies can be built, but one of the most useful methods is to form analogies between pairs of [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|power conjugate variables]]. That is, a pair of variables whose product is [[Power (physics)|power]]. Doing so preserves the correct energy flow between domains, a useful feature when modelling a system as an integrated whole. Examples of systems that require unified modelling are [[mechatronics]] and [[audio electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest such analogy is due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] who, in 1873, associated mechanical [[force]] with electrical [[voltage]]. This analogy became so widespread that sources of voltage are still today referred to as [[electromotive force]]. The power conjugate of voltage is [[electric current]] which, in the Maxwell analogy, maps to mechanical [[velocity]]. [[Electrical impedance]] is the ratio of voltage and current, so by analogy, [[mechanical impedance]] is the ratio of force and velocity. The concept of impedance can be extended to other domains, for instance in acoustics and fluid flow it is the ratio of pressure to rate of flow. In general, impedance is the ratio of an ''effort'' variable and the ''flow'' variable that results. For this reason, the Maxwell analogy is often referred to as the [[impedance analogy]], although the concept of impedance was not conceived until 1886 by [[Oliver Heaviside]], some time after Maxwell's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.4|Busch-Vishniac, p. 20|Smith, p. 1648|Martinsen &amp; Grimnes, p. 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifying power conjugate variables still does not result in a unique analogy, there are multiple ways the conjugates and analogies can be specified. A new analogy was proposed by Floyd A. Firestone in 1933 now known as the [[mobility analogy]]. In this analogy electrical impedance is made analogous to mechanical mobility (the inverse of mechanical impedance). Firestone's idea was to make analogous variables that are measured across an element, and make analogous variables that flow through an element. For instance, the ''across'' variable voltage is the analogy of velocity, and the ''through'' variable current is the analogy of force. Firestone's analogy has the advantage of preserving the topology of element connections when converting between domains. A modified form of the through and across analogy was proposed in 1955 by [[Horace M. Trent]] and is the modern understanding of ''through and across''.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.2|Smith, p. 1648|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamiltonian variables===
The Hamiltonian variables, also called the energy variables, are those variables which when time [[derivative|differentiated]] are equal to the power conjugate variables. The Hamiltonian variables are so called because they are the variables which usually appear in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Hamiltonian variables in the electrical domain are [[electric charge|charge]] (''q'') and [[flux linkage]] (λ) because,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \lambda}{dt} = v &lt;/math&gt; ([[Faraday's law of induction]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dq}{dt} = i&lt;/math&gt;

In the translational mechanical domain the Hamiltonian variables are distance [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] (''x'') and [[momentum]] (''p'') because,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dp}{dt} = F &lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dx}{dt} = u&lt;/math&gt;

There is a corresponding relationship for other analogies and sets of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamiltonian variables are also called the energy variables. The [[integrand]] of a power conjugate variable with respect to a Hamiltonian variable is a measure of energy. For instance,
:&lt;math&gt; \int F dx &lt;/math&gt; and, &lt;math&gt; \int u dp &lt;/math&gt;
are both expressions of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical uses===
Maxwell's analogy was initially used merely to help explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. The work of Firestone, Trent and others moved the field well beyond this, looking to represent systems of multiple energy domains as a single system. In particular, designers started converting the mechanical parts of an electromechanical system to the electrical domain so that the whole system could be analyzed as an electrical circuit. [[Vannevar Bush]] was a pioneer of this kind of modelling in his development of [[analogue computer]]s, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.&lt;ref&gt;Care, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s onward, manufacturers of [[mechanical filter]]s, notably [[Collins Radio]], widely used these analogies in order to take the well -developed theory of [[filter design]] in electrical engineering and apply it to mechanical systems. The quality of filters required for radio applications could not be achieved with electrical components. Much better quality resonators (higher [[Q factor]]) could be made with mechanical parts but there was no equivalent filter theory in mechanical engineering. It was also necessary to have the mechanical parts, the [[transducer]]s, and the electrical components of the circuit analyzed as a complete system in order to predict the overall response of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Taylor &amp; Huang, p. 378|Carr, pp. 170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry F. Olson]] helped popularise the use of dynamical analogies in the audio electronics field with his book ''dynamical analogies'' first published in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Libbey, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-power-conjugate analogies===

A common analogy of magnetic circuits maps [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf) to voltage and [[magnetic flux]] (φ) to electrical current. However, mmf and φ are not power conjugate variables. The product of these is not in units of power and the ratio, known as [[magnetic reluctance]], does not measure the rate of dissipation of energy so is not a true impedance. Where a compatible analogy is required, mmf can be used as the effort variable and ''dφ/dt'' (rate of change of magnetic flux) will then be the flow variable. This is known as the [[gyrator-capacitor model]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely used analogy in the thermal domain maps temperature difference as the effort variable and thermal power as the flow variable. Again, these are not power conjugate variables, and the ratio, known as [[thermal resistance]], is not really an analogy of either impedance or electrical resistance as far as energy flows are concerned. A compatible analogy could take temperature difference as the effort variable and [[entropy]] flow rate as the flow variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19|Regtien, p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalisation===

Many applications of dynamical models convert all energy domains in the system into an electrical circuit and then proceed to analyse the complete system in the electrical domain. There are, however, more generalised methods of representation. One such representation is through the use of [[bond graph]]s, introduced by Henry M. Paynter in 1960. It is usual to use the force-voltage analogy (impedance analogy) with bond graphs, but it is not a requirement to do so. Likewise Trent used a different representation (linear graphs) and his representation has become associated with the force-current analogy (mobility analogy), but again this is not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 8.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors discourage the use of domain specific terminology for the sake of generalisation. For instance, because much of the theory of dynamical analogies arose from electrical theory the power conjugate variables are sometimes called ''V-type'' and ''I-type'' according to whether they are analogs of voltage or current respectively in the electrical domain. Likewise, the Hamiltonian variables are sometimes called ''generalised momentum'' and ''generalised displacement'' according to whether they are analogs of momentum or displacement in the mechanical domain.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic circuit analogies==

===Hydraulic analogy===
A fluid or [[hydraulic analogy]] of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry intuitively in terms of plumbing, where water is analogous to the mobile sea of charge within metals, pressure difference is analogous to [[voltage]], and water's flow rate is analogous to [[electric current]].

===Analogue computers===
Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful. Electronic circuit instruments called [[analog computer]]s were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the [[Norden bombsight]] could also consist of gears and pulleys in calculation.

Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and [[Howard T. Odum]] (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere.

==Philosophical conundrum==
The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/models-science/#ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their lifetime.

'''Biogas''' refers to a mixture of different [[gas]]es produced by the breakdown of [[organic matter]] in the absence of oxygen. Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as [[agricultural waste]], [[manure]], [[municipal waste]], [[plant material]], [[sewage]], [[green waste]] or [[food waste]]. Biogas is a [[renewable energy]] source.

Biogas is produced by [[anaerobic digestion]] with [[methanogen]] or [[anaerobic organism]]s, which digest material inside a closed system, or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of biodegradable materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-fuels-and-energy-factsheet-anaerobic-digestion "NNFCC Renewable Fuels and Energy Factsheet: Anaerobic Digestion"], Retrieved on 2011-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; This closed  system is called an [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digester,]] [[biodigester]] or a [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simgas.com/advantages-of-biogas/how-does-biogas-work/item46|title=How does biogas work?|last=Webdesign|first=Insyde|website=www.simgas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogas is primarily [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{ CO2}}) and may have small amounts of [[hydrogen sulphide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}), moisture and [[siloxane]]s. The gases [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], and [[carbon monoxide]] ({{chem|CO}}) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. This energy release allows biogas to be used as a [[fuel]]; it can be used for any heating purpose, such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/biogas/ |title=Biogas &amp; Engines|publisher=, www.clarke-energy.com|accessdate=  21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogas can be compressed, the same way as [[natural gas]] is compressed to [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/biomethane-fueled-vehicles-the-carbon-neutral-option.html|title= Biomethane fueled vehicles the carbon neutral option|publisher= Claverton Energy Conference  Bath, UK|date= 24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It qualifies for renewable [[energy subsidies]] in some parts of the world. Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards, when it becomes bio-methane. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production-and-use cycle is continuous, and it generates no net carbon dioxide. As the organic material grows, it is converted and used. It then regrows in a continually repeating cycle. From a carbon perspective, as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio-resource as is released, when the material is ultimately converted to energy.

==Production==
{{Main article|Anaerobic digestion}}
The biogas is a renewable energy that can be used for heating, electricity, and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine, such as [[GE Jenbacher]] or [[Caterpillar Inc|Caterpillar]] gas engines.&lt;ref&gt;State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). [http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/re_biomass-manure.htm "Biomass Energy: Manure for Fuel."], 23 April 2009. Web. 3 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To provide these internal combustion engines with biogas having ample gas pressure to optimize combustion, within the European Union [[ATEX directive|ATEX]] centrifugal [[Fan (machine)|fan]] units built in accordance with the European directive [[ATEX directive|2014/34/EU]] (previously 94/9/EG) are obligatory. These centrifugal fan units, for example [[Combimac]], Meidinger AG or Witt &amp; Sohn AG are suitable for use in [[ATEX directive|Zone 1 and 2]] .

Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas. It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.

Biogas is produced either; 
* As [[landfill gas]] (LFG), which is produced by the breakdown of [[biodegradable waste]] inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes, or 
* As digested gas, produced inside an [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digester]].

Projects such as NANOCLEAN are nowadays developing new ways to produce biogas more efficiently, using iron oxide nanoparticles in the processes of organic waste treatment. This process can triple the production of biogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00425|title=Creating BIOGAS+: a new technology to improve the efficiency and profitability in the treatment of biowaste|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR. Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biogas plants ===
A ''biogas plant'' is the name often given to an [[anaerobic digester]] that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters (air-tight tanks with different configurations). These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize [[silage]] or [[biodegradable waste]]s including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the micro-organisms transform biomass waste into biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and [[digestate]].

=== Key processes ===
There are two key processes: [[mesophilic]] and [[thermophilic]] digestion which is dependent on temperature. In experimental work at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], a 1000-litre digester using [[psychrophiles]] harvested from "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" has produced 200–300&amp;nbsp;liters of methane per day, about 20%–30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="NewSc2785p14"&gt;{{cite news

=== Dangers ===
The [[air pollution]] produced by biogas is similar to that of [[natural gas]].  The content of toxic [[hydrogen sulfide]] presents additional risks and has been responsible for serious accidents &lt;ref&gt;Incomplete understanding of biogas chemical hazards – Serious gas poisoning accident while unloading food waste at biogas plant, Journal of Chemical Health &amp; Safety, DOI 10.1016/j.jchas.2018.05.004 &lt;/ref&gt; . Leaks of unburned methane are an additional risk, because methane is a potent [[greenhouse gas]].

Biogas can be [[explosive]] when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to 8–20 parts air. Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work. It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion. Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked; Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water, measured by a pressure gauge.

Frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system. If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately. If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://werkgroepterlinden.be/Biogas.html|title=BIOGAS PROBLEMS|   publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landfill gas ==
{{Main article|Landfill gas}}
Landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a biogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bioenergy.org.nz/biogas.asp |title=Biogas – Bioenergy Association of New Zealand (BANZ) |publisher=Bioenergy.org.nz |date=29  2006 |accessdate=21 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125053346/http://www.bioenergy.org.nz/biogas.asp |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/ LFG energy projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103070211/http://www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/ |date=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above. This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive. Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas. Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen. The lower [[explosive limit]] is 5% methane and the upper is 15% methane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/safety/ Safety Page, Beginners Guide to Biogas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217044037/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/safety/ |date=17 February 2015 }}, www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas. Retrieved 22.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The methane in biogas is 28&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; times more potent a [[greenhouse gas]] than carbon dioxide. Therefore, uncontained landfill gas, which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the [[effects of global warming]]. In addition, [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) in landfill gas contribute to the formation of [[Smog#Photochemical smog|photochemical smog]].

===Technical===

[[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro-organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of material being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester.

Another term related to biodigesters is effluent dirtiness, which tells how much organic material there is per unit of biogas source. Typical units for this measure are in mg BOD/litre. As an example, effluent dirtiness can range between 800–1200&amp;nbsp;mg BOD/litre in Panama.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

From 1&amp;nbsp;kg of decommissioned kitchen bio-waste, 0.45 m³ of biogas can be obtained. The price for collecting biological waste from households is approximately €70 per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=Biogas – a sustainable energy source: new measures and possibilities for SLovenia|journal=Journal of Energy Technology|date=2011|issue=5|pages=11–24|url=http://www.fe.um.si/images/jet/jet4-5-internet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of biogas varies depending upon the substrate composition, as well as the conditions within the anaerobic reactor (temperature, pH, and substrate concentration).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biogas/vignettes/predBg_function.pdf|title=Predicting methane and biogas production with the biogas package|last=Hafner|first=Sasha|date=2017|website=CRAN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Landfill gas]] typically has methane concentrations around 50%. Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55%–75% methane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaktech-environmental.com/Juniper.htm|title=Juniper|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to 80%–90% methane using [[in-situ]] gas purification techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| last2 = Herndon | first2 = F.

The fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature; correction of measured gas volume for water vapour content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| first2 = R.| first3 = T.| first4 = W. | title = Methods for kinetic analysis of methane fermentation in high solids biomass digesters| last1 = Richards | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 1| issue = 2 | pages =  65–73| year = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(91)90028-B| last2 =    Cummings| last3 =    White| last4 =    Jewell}}&lt;/ref&gt; which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas.

In some cases, biogas contains [[siloxanes]]. They are formed from the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents. During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes, [[silicon]] is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the [[combustion gas]]. Deposits are formed containing mostly [[silica]] ({{chem|SiO|2}}) or [[silicates]] ({{chem|Si|''x''|O|''y''}}) and can contain [[calcium]], [[sulfur]], [[zinc]], [[phosphorus]]. Such ''white mineral'' deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means.

Practical and cost-effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available.&lt;ref name="BiogasSiloxaneRemoval"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://biogas-digester.com/biogas-technology-lowers-costs.html|title=New Landfill Gas Treatment Technology Dramatically Lowers Energy Production Costs|last=Tower|first=P.|author2=Wetzel, J. |author3=Lombard, X. |date=March 2006|publisher=Applied Filter Technology|accessdate=30 April 2009}}(broken link)&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1000&amp;nbsp;kg (wet weight) of input to a typical biodigester, total solids may be 30% of the wet weight while [[volatile suspended solids]] may be 90% of the total solids. Protein would be 20% of the volatile solids, carbohydrates would be 70% of the volatile solids, and finally fats would be 10% of the volatile solids.

==Benefits of manure derived biogas==
High levels of [[methane]] are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions. During storage and when manure has been applied to the land, [[nitrous oxide]] is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process. Nitrous oxide ({{chem|N|2O}}) is 320 times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/indust/ghgas.htm Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117230623/http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/Indust/GHGas.htm |date=17 January 2016 }}'', Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations''&lt;/ref&gt; and methane 25 times more than carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html Overview of Greenhouse Gases, Methane Emissions].'' Climate Change, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 11 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By converting cow manure into methane biogas via [[anaerobic digestion]], the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce 100 billion kiloWatt hours of electricity, enough to power millions of homes across the United States. In fact, one cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate 3 kiloWatt hours of electricity; only 2.4 kiloWatt hours of electricity are needed to power a single 100-Watt light bulb for one day.&lt;ref&gt;State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). "Biomass Energy: Manure for Fuel." State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). State of Texas, 23 April 2009.

Biogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works,&lt;ref name="Administrator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfagy.com/biogas-chp.html|title=Biogas CHP – Alfagy – Profitable Greener Energy via CHP, Cogen and Biomass Boiler using Wood, Biogas, Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Vegetable Oil, Syngas and Straw|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430111432/http://alfagy.com/biogas-chp.html|archive-date=30 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Cogeneration|CHP]] [[gas engine]], where the [[waste heat]] from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester; cooking; space heating; [[water heating]]; and process heating. If compressed, it can replace [[compressed natural gas]] for use in vehicles, where it can fuel an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[fuel cell]]s and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in on-site CHP plants.&lt;ref name="Administrator" /&gt;

===Biogas upgrading===
Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60% methane and 29% {{chem|CO|2}} with trace elements of {{chem|H|2|S}}: inadequate for use in machinery. The corrosive nature of {{chem|H|2|S}} alone is enough to destroy the mechanisms.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abatzoglou|first1=Nicolas|last2=Boivin|first2=Steve|title=A review of biogas purification processes|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining|volume=3|issue=1|year=2009|pages=42–71|issn=1932-104X|doi=10.1002/bbb.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertasGiraldo2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huertas|first1=J.I.|last2=Giraldo|first2=N.|last3=Izquierdo|first3=S.|title=Removal of H2S and CO2 from Biogas by Amine Absorption|year=2011|doi=10.5772/20039|journal=Mass Transfer in Chemical Engineering Processes|isbn=978-953-307-619-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methane in biogas can be concentrated via a [[biogas upgrader]] to the same standards as fossil [[natural gas]], which itself has to go through a cleaning process, and becomes ''biomethane''. If the local gas network allows, the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks. Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept. [[Carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], and [[particulate]]s must be removed if present.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"/&gt;

There are four main methods of upgrading: water washing, pressure swing absorption, selexol absorption, and [[amine gas treating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgc.se/dokument/Evaluation.pdf|title=Nyheter – SGC|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing, and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf Petersson A., Wellinger A. (2009). Biogas upgrading technologies – developments and innovations. IEA Bioenergy Task 37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031426/http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf |date=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas. This arrangement could deliver 98% methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2% methane loss in the system. It takes roughly between 3% and 6% of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system.

===Biogas gas-grid injection===
Gas-grid injection is the injection of biogas into the [[methane grid]] ([[natural gas grid]]). Until the breakthrough of [[micro combined heat and power]] two-thirds of all the energy produced by [[Anaerobic digestion|biogas power plant]]s was lost (as heat). Using the grid to transport the gas to customers, the energy can be used for [[Distributed generation|on-site generation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea//news/article/2008/07/biogas-flows-through-germanys-grid-big-time-53075 |title=Biogas Flows Through Germany's Grid Big Time – Renewable Energy News Article |date=14 March 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=17 June 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314003328/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea//news/article/2008/07/biogas-flows-through-germanys-grid-big-time-53075 |archive-date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy. Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from 1% to 2%; in electricity transmission they range from 5% to 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyvortex.com/energydictionary/energy_loss__transmission_loss.html|title=energy loss, transmission loss|publisher=|access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before being injected in the gas grid, biogas passes a cleaning process, during which it is upgraded to natural gas quality. During the cleaning process trace components harmful to the gas grid and the final users are removed.&lt;ref name=":1&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgc.se/ckfinder/userfiles/files/SGC118.pdf|title=Adding gas from biomass to the gas grid|last=|first=|date=|website=Swedish Gas Center|publisher=Swedish Gas Center|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas in transport===
[[File:Biogas-train-amanda-in-linkoping-2006.JPG|thumb|250px|"Biogaståget Amanda" ("Amanda the Biogas Train") train near [[Linköping]] station, Sweden]]
If concentrated and compressed, it can be used in vehicle transportation. Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and Germany. A biogas-powered train, named Biogaståget Amanda (The Biogas Train Amanda), has been in service in Sweden since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskbiogas.se/sb/docs/english/Biogastrain_produktblad_2005.pdf Biogas train in Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143008/http://www.svenskbiogas.se/sb/docs/english/Biogastrain_produktblad_2005.pdf |date=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friendly fuel trains (30 October 2005) [[New Straits Times]], p. F17.&lt;/ref&gt; Biogas powers automobiles. In 1974, a British documentary film titled ''Sweet as a Nut'' detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom-adapted combustion engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/96790|title=Bates Car – Sweet As a Nut (1975)|work=BFI|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/bates_car_sweet_as_a_nut/|title=Bate's Car: Sweet as a Nut|author=National Film Board of Canada|work=NFB.ca|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an estimated 12,000 vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide, mostly in Europe.&lt;ref name="What is biogas" /&gt;

===Measuring in biogas environments===
Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas (or air) category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters, landfills, and animal feeding operations (covered livestock lagoons).

Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere. Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking, although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop. They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value.

==Legislation==

===European Union===
The European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the [[Landfill Directive]].

Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long-term revenue and energy security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=72 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110323/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=72 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=CHP &amp;#124; Combined Heat and Power &amp;#124; Cogeneration &amp;#124; Wood Biomass Gasified Co-generation &amp;#124; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Electricity Generation |publisher=Alfagy.com |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]]. The United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) emitted. If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds 50 tonnes per year, the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs. Treatment of the landfill gas is usually by combustion. Because of the remoteness of landfill sites, it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas.

==Global developments==

=== United States ===
With the many benefits of biogas, it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more. In 2003, the United States consumed 147 trillion BTU of energy from "landfill gas", about 0.6% of the total U.S. natural gas consumption.&lt;ref name="What is biogas"&gt;[http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/emerging_biogas_what_is.html What is biogas?], U.S. Department of Energy, 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the U.S. According to a 2008 study, collected by the ''Science and Children'' magazine, methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce 100 billion [[kilowatt hour]]s enough to power millions of homes across America. Furthermore, methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce 99 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about 4% of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cuellar, Amanda D and Michael E Webber|title=Cow power: the energy and emissions benefits of converting manure to biogas|year=2008 |journal=Environ.

In Vermont, for example, biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program. The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program. Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill, and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program. In [[Sheldon, Vermont]], Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program. It started when the brothers who own the farm, Bill and Brian Rowell, wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms, including manure odor, and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals. They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their 950 cows to produce renewable energy, a bedding to replace sawdust, and a plant-friendly fertilizer. The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program. On average, the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power 300 to 350 other homes. The generator capacity is about 300 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;Zezima, Katie. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/businessspecial2/24farmers.html Electricity From What Cows Leave Behind]."

In [[Hereford, Texas]], cow manure is being used to power an [[ethanol fuel|ethanol power]] plant. By switching to methane biogas, the ethanol power plant has saved 1000 barrels of oil a day. Over all, the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas.&lt;ref&gt;State Energy Conservation Office (Texas).

In [[Oakley, Kansas]], an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using [[Integrated Manure Utilization System]] "IMUS" to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure, municipal organics and ethanol plant waste. At full capacity the plant is expected to replace 90% of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol and methanol.&lt;ref&gt;Trash-to-energy trend boosts anaerobic digesters [http://finance-commerce.com/2013/10/trash-to-energy-trend-boosts-anaerobic-digesters/]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western Plains Energy finishing up North America’s largest biogas digester [http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2013/03/13/western-plains-energy-finishing-up-north-americas-largest-biogas-digester/]."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The level of development varies greatly in Europe. While countries such as Germany, Austria and Sweden are fairly advanced in their use of biogas, there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent, especially in Eastern Europe. Different legal frameworks, education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential.&lt;ref name="SEBE Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebe2013.eu |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141128141840/http://www.sebe2013.eu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 November 2014 |title=About SEBE |publisher= |accessdate=15 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioenergie.fnr.de/fileadmin/bioenergie-beratung/hessen/dateien/archiv_veranstaltungen/konfliktmanagement_maciejczyk_12_2010.pdf |title=404 – Seite nicht gefunden auf Server der Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e.V.: FNR |publisher= |accessdate=17 June 2016 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the European Biogas Association (EBA) was founded in Brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe. EBA's strategy defines three priorities: establish biogas as an important part of Europe’s energy mix, promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential, and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel. In July 2013, it had 60 members from 24 countries across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-biogas.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=4|title=European Biogas Association|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===
{{As of|September 2013}}, there are about 130 non-sewage biogas plants in the UK. Most are on-farm, and some larger facilities exist off-farm, which are taking food and consumer wastes.&lt;ref&gt;The Official Information Portal on AD [http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/ad-map.html 'Biogas Plant Map']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2010, biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time. Sewage from over 30,000 Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot [[sewage treatment]] works, where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas, which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately 200 homes.&lt;ref&gt;Sewage project sends first ever renewable gas to grid [http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/corp/hs.xsl/10982.htm Thames Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Green-Energy company [[Ecotricity]] announced their plans to build three grid-injecting digesters.

=== Italy  ===
{{As of|September 2018}}, in Italy there are more than 200 biogas plants with a production of about 1.2GW &lt;ref&gt;ANSA Ambiente &amp; Energia [https://www.ansa.it/canale_ambiente/notizie/energia/2017/02/24/biogas-italia-vale-24-mld-metri-cubi-anno-quarti-al-mondo_f6ebe8ad-b85d-40da-bb1f-a3bb35f073ec.html Installed biogas power in Italy]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;AuCo Solutions biogas software [https://aucosolutions.com/en/Biogas.html  Biogas software solution]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Snam IES Biogas ['http://www.iesbiogas.it/en/biogas-plants-italy/369 Biogas Plant in Italy']&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a CHP which produces electric power by burning the bio methane. The electrical power is then fed into the public power grid.&lt;ref name="IEA 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass for Power Generation and CHP|url=http://www.iea.org/techno/essentials3.pdf|publisher=IEA|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was 2,291 MW.&lt;ref name="Fachverband Biogas 2011" /&gt; The electricity supply was approximately 12.8 TWh, which is 12.6% of the total generated renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy Sources |url=https://wastersblog.com/1653/examples-of-renewable-resources/ |accessdate=6 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the co-fermentation of energy crops (called 'NawaRo', an abbreviation of ''nachwachsende Rohstoffe'', German for renewable resources) mixed with manure. The main crop used is corn. Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation.&lt;ref name="Wieland, P. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieland|first=P.|title=Production and Energetic Use of Biogas from Energy Crops and Wastes in Germany|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p01720g04122n251/fulltext.pdf|journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology|volume=109|pages=263–274|accessdate=5 November 2011|doi=10.1385/abab:109:1-3:263|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK, where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common.&lt;ref name="Eurobserv'er 2010"/&gt;

Biogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last 20 years. The main reason is the legally created frameworks. Government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the Electricity Feed-in Act (''StrEG''). This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid, thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy.&lt;ref name="IfnE et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Erneuerbare Energien in Deutschland.

This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years. The amount of around 8{{nbsp}}¢/kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income.&lt;ref name="Wieland, P. 2003" /&gt;

The German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in 2004 by implementing the so-called NawaRo-Bonus. This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources, that is, energy crops.&lt;ref name="Wieland, P. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieland|first=P.|title=Biomass Digestion in Agriculture: A Successful Pathway for the Energy Production and Waste Treatment in Germany|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.2006 20128/pdf|publisher=Engineering in Life Science |accessdate=5 November 2011|doi=10.1002/elsc.2006_20128|doi-broken-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the ‘Integrated Climate and Energy Programme’.

This continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production.&lt;ref name="Kanning et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanning|first=H.|title=Erneuerbare Energien – Räumliche Dimensionen, neue Akteurslandschaften und planerische (Mit)Gestaltungspotenziale am Beispiel des Biogaspfades|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/907371418487t402/fulltext.pdf|publisher=Raumforschung und Raumordnung|accessdate=5 November 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first challenge to be noticed is the high area-consuming of the biogas electric power supply. In 2011 energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa 800,000 ha in Germany.&lt;ref name="FNR 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultivation of renewable Resources in Germany|url=http://www.nachwachsenderohstoffe.de/fileadmin/fnr/images/aktuelles/grafiken /FNR510_Grafik_Anbau_2011_engl__300_rgb.jpg|publisher=FNR|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto. Moreover, new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic, political and civil background. Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering. Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused.&lt;ref name="Kanning et al. 2009" /&gt;

=== Indian subcontinent ===

Biogas in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/waste-management-and-biogas/|title=GPS Renewables – Waste management through biogas – GPS Renewables|work=GPS Renewables|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075723/http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/waste-management-and-biogas/|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these "gobar" gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time, especially in rural India. In the last 2–3 decades, research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model.

The Deenabandhu Model is a new biogas-production model popular in India. (''Deenabandhu'' means "friend of the helpless.") The unit usually has a capacity of 2 to 3 cubic metres. It is constructed using bricks or by a [[ferrocement]] mixture. In India, the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model; however, India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed.

Biogas which is mainly methane/natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle, poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating ''[[Methylococcus capsulatus]]'' bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04-huslid.pdf |title=BioProtein Production |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/ |title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargill.com/2016/new-venture-selects-cargill-tennessee-to-produce-feedkind |title=New venture selects Cargill’s Tennessee site to produce Calysta FeedKind® Protein |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be  put to use in cheaper production of [[algae oil]] or [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] from [[algaculture]] particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/01/20150121-algenol.html#more |title=Algenol and Reliance launch algae fuels demonstration project in India |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/ExxonMobil-Announces-Breakthrough-In-Renewable-Energy.html |title=ExxonMobil Announces Breakthrough In Renewable Energy |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union government of India is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/indrapratha-gas-mahindra-mahindra-join-hands-to-stop-stubble-burning/62986917|title=Indrapratha Gas, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra join hands to stop stubble burning|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/modi-govt-plans-gobar-dhan-scheme-to-convert-cattle-dung-into-energy/63028408|title=Modi govt plans Gobar-Dhan scheme to convert cattle dung into energy|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these plants, the non edible biomass or waste of edible biomass is converted in to high value products without any water pollution or [[green house gas]] (GHG) emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/672719/calysta-feedkind.pdf |title=Assessment of environmental impact of FeedKind protein |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices. Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments. This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct. Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/monitoring-methodology/|title=GPS Renewables – Monitoring Methodology – GPS Renewables|work=GPS Renewables|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel.

In India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of [[manure]] in small-scale digestion facilities is called [[Biogas#Gobar gas|gobar gas]]; it is estimated that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in India, 50,000 in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan, particularly North Punjab, due to the thriving population of livestock. The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection. The manure is directed to the pit, usually straight from the cattle shed. The pit is filled with a required quantity of [[wastewater]]. The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves. The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke. Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages, it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs. One type of these system is the Sintex Digester. Some designs use [[vermiculture]] to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/skgsangha|title=Biogas plants provide cooking and fertiliser|work=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|accessdate=15 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927224851/http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/skgsangha|archive-date=27 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nepal, the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home.

===China===
The Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since 1958. Around 1970, China had installed 6,000,000 digesters in an effort to make [[agriculture]] more efficient. During the last years the technology has met high growth rates. This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/china-biogas.html Biogas in China.  Retrieved 27 October 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In developing nations===
Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry, the fermented manure. This technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing 50&amp;nbsp;kg manure per day, an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows. This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant. Toilets can be connected. Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process. With an optimum at 36 C° the technology especially applies for those living in a (sub) tropical climate. This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable.&lt;ref name="Roubík"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roubík|first=Hynek|last2=Mazancová|first2=Jana|last3=Banout|first3=Jan|last4=Verner|first4=Vladimír|date=2016-01-20|title=Addressing problems at small-scale biogas plants: a case study from central Vietnam|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615013426|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=112, Part 4|pages=2784–2792|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the user, biogas provides clean cooking energy, reduces indoor air pollution, and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection, especially for women and children. The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name="Roubík"/&gt;

== Society and culture ==

In the 1985 Australian film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' the post-apocalyptic settlement Barter town is powered by a central biogas system based upon a piggery. As well as providing electricity, methane is used to power Barter's vehicles.

"Cow Town", written in the early 1940s, discuss the travails of a city vastly built on cow manure and the hardships brought upon by the resulting methane biogas. Carter McCormick, an engineer from a town outside the city, is sent in to figure out a way to utilize this gas to help power, rather than suffocate, the city.

The Biogas production is providing nowadays new opportunities for skilled employment, drawing on the development of new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00426|title=Generating new employment opportunities [Social Impact]|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR.

'''Meditation''' and its effect on '''brain activity''' and the [[central nervous system]] became a focus of collaborative research in [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]] and [[neurobiology]] during the latter half of the 20th century. [[Research on meditation]] sought to define and characterize various practices. Meditation’s effect on the brain can be broken up into two categories: state changes and trait changes, respectively alterations in brain activities during the act of meditating and changes that are the outcome of long-term practice.

[[Mindfulness]] meditation is frequently studied, a [[Buddhist meditation]] approach found in [[Zen]] and [[Vipassana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Buddhism |last=Mizuno |first=Kogen |year=1972 |publisher=Kosei Publishing Company |location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vipassana : A Universal Buddhist Meditation Technique |last=Ahir |first=D.C. |year=1999 |publisher=Sri Satguru Publications |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] describes mindfulness meditation as a complete, unbiased attention to the current moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wherever You Go, There You Are : Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life 
 |last=Kabat-Zinn |first=Jon |year=1998 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in brain state==

=== Electroencephalography===
[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) has been used in many studies as a primary method for evaluating the meditating brain.  Electroencephalography uses electrical leads placed all over the scalp to measure the collective electrical activity of the [[cerebral cortex]].  Specifically, EEG measures the electric fields of large groups of neurons.  EEG has the benefit of excellent temporal resolution and is able to measure aggregate activity of portions or the entire cortex down to the millisecond scale.  Unlike other imaging based methods, EEG does not have good spatial resolution and is more appropriately used to evaluate the running spontaneous activity of the cortex.  This spontaneous activity is classified into four main classifications based on the frequency of the activity, ranging from low frequency delta waves (&lt; 4&amp;nbsp;Hz) commonly found during sleep to beta waves (13–30&amp;nbsp;Hz) associated with an awake and alert brain.  In between these two extremes are theta waves (4–8&amp;nbsp;Hz) and alpha waves (8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz).

Many studies on mindfulness meditation, assessed in a review by Cahn and Polich in 2006, have linked lower frequency alpha waves, as well as theta waves, to meditation.&lt;ref name="Cahn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cahn BR, Polich J |title = Meditation states and traits : EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies|pmid=16536641 |journal = Psychological Bulletin |volume = 132 |pages = 180–211 |year = 2006 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |issue=2 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much older studies report more specific findings, such as decreased alpha blocking and increased frontal lobe specific theta activity.&lt;ref name="Kasamatsu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kasamatsu KH, Hirai T |title = An electroencephalographic study on the zen meditation (Zazen) |journal = Folia Psychiatrica et Neurologica Japonica |volume = 20 |pages = 315–336 |year = 1966 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.1966.tb02646.x |pmid=6013341 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha blocking is a phenomenon where the active brain, normally presenting beta wave activity, cannot as easily switch to alpha wave activity often involved in memory recall.  These findings would suggest that in a meditative state a person is more relaxed but maintains a sharp awareness.  Two large, recent comprehensive review works, however, point to poor control and statistical analyses in these early studies and comment that it can only be said with confidence that increased alpha and theta wave activity exists.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Chiesa A, Serretti, A |title = A systematic review of neurobiological and clinical features of mindfulness meditations |journal = Psychological Medicine |volume = 40 |issue = 8 |pages = 1239–1252 |year = 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1017/S0033291709991747 |pmid=19941676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroimaging===
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is another highly utilized methodology for studying state changes in meditating brains.  fMRI detects subtle increases in blood flow to areas of the brain with higher metabolic activity.  Thus these areas of increased metabolic activity indicate which regions of the brain are currently being used to process whatever stimuli presented.  Counter to EEG, the advantage of fMRI is its spatial resolution, with the ability to produce detailed spatial maps of brain activity.  It suffers, however, in temporal resolution and cannot measure progressive activity, like the EEG, with much detail.

====Topographical findings====
As a relatively new technology, fMRI has only recently been used to assess brain state changes during meditation.  Recent studies have shown heightened activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]], and [[prefrontal cortex]], specifically in the dorsal medial prefrontal area during Vipassana meditation.&lt;ref name="Holzel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holzel BK, Ott U, Hempel H, Hackl A, Wolf K, Stark R, Vaitl D |title = Differential engagement of anterior cingulate and adjacent medial frontal cortex in adept meditators and non-meditators |journal = Neuroscience Letters |volume = 421 |pages = 16–21 |year = 2007 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2007.04.074 |pmid=17548160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the [[cingulate cortex]] and [[frontal cortex]] areas were shown to have increased activity during Zen meditation.&lt;ref name="Pagnoni"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagnoni G, Cekic M, Guo Y |title = ‘ Thinking about not- thinking’: neural correlates of conceptual processing during Zen meditation |journal = PLoS ONE |volume = 3 |pages = e3083 |year = 2008 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003083}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both studies comment on the possibility that these findings could indicate some state of heightened voluntary control over attention during mindfulness meditation.  Review works by Cahn and Chiesa state that these results indicate consistency in meditation’s effect on these regions of the brain, citing a multitude of other studies spanning other meditative disciplines, but mention the need for further investigation with better controls.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa" /&gt;

====Study on meditation and emotion====
The review by Cahn also notes findings describing a heightened emotional state of meditators.  A more complex study, conducted in 2008 by Lutz et al., focused on emotional response during meditation.&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lutz A, Brefczynski-Lewis J, Johnstone T, Davidson RJ |title = Regulation of the Neural Circuitry of Emotion by Compassion Meditation: Effects of Meditative Expertise |journal = PLoS ONE |volume = 3 |issue=3 |pages = e1897 |year = 2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001897 |pmid=18365029 |pmc=2267490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This investigation involved the creation of a “compassion meditation” state by novice and experienced meditators and testing the meditators response to emotionally charged sounds.  fMRI results indicated heightened activity in the cingulate cortex but also in the [[amygdala]], temporo-parietal junction, and right posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] in response to the emotional sounds.  The authors of this study believe this indicates greater sensitivity to emotional expression and positive emotion due to the neural circuitry activated.&lt;ref name="Lutz" /&gt;

==Changes in brain due to the prolonged practice==

===Electroencephalography===
Similar to research into state changes in brain function, older studies make more specific claims about trait changes in meditators versus non-meditators. Changes to the alpha wave were indicated to be a trait, as well as state, phenomena. Studies have reported an increase in the specific frequencies expressed in the alpha range, increased alpha band power, and an overall slowing (reduction in frequency) in EEG activity in experienced meditators versus less experienced meditators while meditating.&lt;ref name="Kasamatsu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stigsby"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stigsby B, Rodenberg JC, Moth HB |title = Electroencephalographic findings during mantra meditation (transcendental meditation). A controlled, quantitative study of experienced meditators |journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume = 51 |pages = 434–442 |year = 1981 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(81)90107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alpha blocking phenomena, observed as a state change in brain function, was investigated as a possible trait change as well.  One study that examined a variety of meditation techniques tried to show that alpha blocking was affected by the long term practice of meditation by testing response to auditory stimuli.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker DE, Shapiro D |title = Physiological responses to clicks during Zen, yoga, and TM meditation |journal = Psychophysiology |volume = 18 |pages = 694–699 |year = 1981 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Review works, however, comment on inconsistent findings as well as a lack of repeated results in this, and other studies.  They further remark that, similar to observations in brain state changes, only general assertions can be made about brain trait changes: some change in the electroencephalographic profile exists but with some inconsistency.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Andersen J |title = Meditation meets behavioural medicine: The story of experimental research on meditation |journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume = 7 |pages = 17–73 |year = 2000&lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that these trait changes were observed during meditation, and although it does indicate that a practitioner’s electroencephalographic profile is modified by the practice of meditation, these EEG studies have not yet shown changes in non-meditating brains, even of experienced meditators.

[[File:Hippocampus.gif|thumb|left|Red region of the brain shows the [[hippocampus]] which had been shown to have heightened activity during meditation by experienced meditators.]]

===Neuroimaging===
Brain trait changes have also been observed in neuroimaging studies, most often employing fMRI. In a [[meta-analysis]] of 21 neuroimaging studies, eight brain regions were found to be consistently altered, including areas key to meta-awareness (frontopolar cortex/[[Brodmann area 10]]), exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness ([[sensory cortex]] and [[insular cortex]]), memory consolidation and reconsolidation ([[hippocampus]]), self and emotion regulation ([[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]), and intra- and interhemispheric communication (superior longitudinal fasciculus; [[corpus callosum]])&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of morphometric neuroimaging in meditation practitioners|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date=June 2014|volume=43|pages=48–73|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.016 |pmid=24705269}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were distinguished by density increases in [[grey matter]] regions and [[white matter]] pathways in the brains of individuals who meditate in comparison to individuals who do not. Of all areas with reported findings, a greater number of structural changes were found in the left hemisphere.
   
There is also evidence to suggest meditation plays a protective role against the natural reduction in [[grey matter]] volume associated with aging. One study found evidence that Zen meditators experienced a slower age related decline rate for cerebral gray matter volume in the [[putamen]] which plays a role in learning, cognitive flexibility and attentional processing &lt;ref name="Pagnoni2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagnoni G, Cekic M |title = Age effects on gray matter volume and attentional performance in Zen meditation |journal = Neurobiology of Aging |volume = 28 |pages = 1623–1627 |year = 2007 |doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.06.008 |pmid = 17655980 |issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could suggest a better attentiveness in aging meditators versus non-meditators.

Long-term meditation practitioners have also shown to have a higher tolerance for pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=J. A.|author2=Rainville, P.|title=Pain Sensitivity and Analgesic Effects of Mindful States in Zen Meditators: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=5 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e31818f52ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been correlated to altered function and structure in somatosensory cortices and an increased ability to decouple regions in the brain associated with the cognitive appraisal of pain ([[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Joshua A.|author2=Courtemanche, Jérôme |author3=Rainville, Pierre |title=A non-elaborative mental stance and decoupling of executive and pain-related cortices predicts low pain sensitivity in Zen meditators|journal=Pain|date=January 2011|volume=152|issue=1|pages=150–156|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.006|pmid=21055874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain state changes found in meditators are almost exclusively found in higher-order executive and association cortices.&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"/&gt; This supports the notion that meditation increases self-regulation and attentiveness. Recent studies have also investigated how these changes may alter the functionality and connectivity of the [[default mode network]], which is a hypothesized network of brain regions that are active when an individual is engaged in internal tasks such as daydreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jang|first=Joon Hwan|author2=Jung, Wi Hoon |author3=Kang, Do-Hyung |author4=Byun, Min Soo |author5=Kwon, Soo Jin |author6=Choi, Chi-Hoon |author7= Kwon, Jun Soo |title=Increased default mode network connectivity associated with meditation|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=487|issue=3|pages=358–362|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2010.10.056 |pmid=21034792 |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity of findings===
In the meta-analysis performed by Fox et al., several sources of bias were indicated which bring into question the validity of meditation studies which use neuroimaging. Fox et al. suggests a publication bias may be leading to the over-reporting of significant results.&lt;ref name="Kieran C.R 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of morphometric neuroimaging in meditation practitioners|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=43|pages=48–73|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.016 |pmid=24705269 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, however, Fox et al. found "consistent differences in prefrontal cortex and body awareness regions" in "areas key to meta-awareness..., exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness..., memory consolidation and reconsolidation..., self and emotion regulation..., and intra- and interhemispheric communication..." and that changes were significant with "moderate" global median effect size and "consistent and medium-sized brain structure differences."&lt;ref name="Kieran C.R 2014" /&gt;

More research will be needed before any firm conclusions can be made.

==Popular literature==

===Positive portrayal===
Besides scientific literature, some authors have written of the promising [[research on meditation]] in books targeted for general audiences.  One such book, Buddha’s Brain by Rick Hanson, PhD shares the current scientific research and investigations into meditation.&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddha’s Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom |last=Hanson |first=Rick |year=2009 |publisher=New Harbinger Publication, INC |location=Oakland, CA|isbn=978-1572246959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanson, a neuroscientist and researcher, explains to readers the scientific studies in plain language and discuss the impact of the results.  Hanson’s main argument is that positive emotions, like love can be strengthened through meditation in a neuroplastic manner, citing dozens of scientific studies to support this claim.&lt;ref name=Hanson /&gt;  Hanson’s viewpoint is representative of a larger popular movement to study and embrace Eastern phenomena including meditation in the Western world.

Critics, like Owen Flanagan, PhD, believe that Hanson, and those like him, are overextending the results of current scientific studies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  In his book ''Bodhisattva’s Brain: Buddhism Naturalized'', Flanagan presents a more conservative viewpoint of current scientific research and cautions readers against the seemingly exciting results of recent studies.&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;{{cite book |title= Bodhisattva’s Brain: Buddhism Naturalized |last=Flanagan |first=Owen |year=2011 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0262016049}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flanagan does not believe current science supports the idea that positive emotion can be strengthened in the same way that stroke victims can recover use of limbs with use.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;  Flanagan does acknowledge that meditation may be beneficial in some way, but the mechanism of how meditation affects the brain is still clouded.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;  Similarly, Awasthi argues that Meditation is non-specific to the research studies showing clinical efficacy in some cases, though mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;ref name="Awasthi"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Awasthi B |title = Issues and perspectives in meditation research: in search for a definition|pmid=23335908  |journal = Frontiers in Psychology
 |volume = 3 |pages = 613 |year = 2013 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00613 |pmc=3541715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanagan and Hanson use many of the same scientific studies to attempt to support their differing viewpoint, but both authors identify the need and importance of future studies investigating meditation.

The '''Common Weakness Enumeration''' (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It is sustained by a community project with the goals of understanding flaws in software and creating automated tools that can be used to identify, fix, and prevent those flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cwe.mitre.org/about/index.html |title=CWE - About CWE|publisher=at mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is sponsored by the [[National Cybersecurity FFRDC]], which is owned by [[Mitre Corporation|The MITRE Corporation]], with support from [[US-CERT]] and the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories National Vulnerabilities Database CWE Slice] at nist.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.0 of the CWE standard was released in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/news/index.html#nov162017_CWE_Version_3.0_Now_Available|title=CWE News|publisher=at mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CWE has over 600 categories, including classes for buffer overflows, path/directory tree traversal errors, race conditions, [[cross-site scripting]], hard-coded passwords, and insecure random numbers.&lt;ref name=samate&gt;[https://samate.nist.gov/BF/Enlightenment/CWE.html The Bugs Framework (BF) / Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)] at nist.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* CWE category 121 is for stack-based buffer overflows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflows]&lt;/ref&gt;

== CWE compatibility ==
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Compatibility program allows a service or a product to be reviewed and registered as officially "CWE-Compatible" and "CWE-Effective". The program assists organizations in selecting the right software tools and learning about possible weaknesses and their possible impact.

In order to obtain CWE Compatible status a product or a service must meet 4 out of 6 requirements, shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''CWE Searchable'''
| users may search security elements using CWE identifiers
|-
| '''CWE Output'''
| security elements presented to users includes, or allows users to obtain, associated CWE identifiers
|-
| '''Mapping Accuracy'''
| security elements accurately link to the appropriate CWE identifiers
|-
| '''CWE Documentation'''
| capability's documentation describes CWE, CWE compatibility, and how CWE-related functionality in the capability is used
|-
| '''CWE Coverage'''
| for CWE-Compatibility and CWE-Effectiveness, the capability's documentation explicitly lists the CWE-IDs that the capability claims coverage and effectiveness against locating in software
|-
| '''CWE Test Results'''
| for CWE-Effectiveness, test results from the capability showing the results of assessing software for the CWEs are posted on the CWE Web site
|}

There are 48 organizations as of January 2018 that develop and maintain products and services that achieved CWE Compatible status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/compatible.html |title=CWE - CWE-Compatible Products and Services|publisher=at mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research, critiques, and new developments ==
Some researchers think that ambiguities in CWE can be avoided or reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Black, Irena V. Bojanova, Yaacov Yesha, Yan Wu. 2015. [https://www.nist.gov/publications/towards-147periodic-table148-bugs Towards a “Periodic Table” of Bugs]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common assault''' was an [[offence (law)|offence]] under the [[common law]] of England, and has been held now to be a [[statutory]] offence in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. It is committed by a person who causes another person to apprehend the immediate use of unlawful violence by the [[defendant]]. It was thought to include [[battery (crime)|battery]] but it does not. In England and Wales, the penalty and mode of trial for this offence is now provided section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], and it has been held that the offence should be alleged as contrary to the statute because of this. It was also held that common assault and battery are two distinct offences, so that a charge that the accused "assaulted and battered" another person would be bad for [[Duplicity (law)|duplicity]] (the rule against charging more than one offence in a single count).

==Statute==
Section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] provides:

{{Blockquote|Common assault and battery shall be summary offences and a person guilty of either of them shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/39|title=Criminal Justice Act 1988|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 13th September 2018, the [[Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018]] received Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 — UK Parliament |url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/assaultsonemergencyworkersoffences.html |website=services.parliament.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This added a subsection which states any common assault and/or battery on an emergency services worker is also now indictable and therefore subject to a maximum of 12 months if tried on indictment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018-Common assault and battery |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/23/section/1/enacted |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients of the offence==
Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 does not contain a definition of the expression "common assault" that appears there. What the offence actually consists of must be determined by reference to [[case law]].

A person commits an assault if they perform an act (which does not for this purpose include a mere omission to act) by which they intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate unlawful violence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Venna [1976] QB 421 at 429, 61 Cr App R 310 at 314, CA, Smith v Chief Superintendent of Woking Police Station, 76 Cr App R 234, DC, R v Ireland, R v Burstow [1998] AC 147, HL&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Actus reus''===
Both in the [[common law]] and under [[statute]], the ''[[actus reus]]'' of a common assault is committed when one person causes another to apprehend or fear that [[force]] is about to be used to cause some degree of personal contact and possible injury. There must be some quality of reasonableness to the apprehension on the part of the victim. If the physical contact is everyday social behaviour such as a handshake or friendly pat on the back, this is acceptable even though the victim may have a [[phobia]] although, if the defendant is aware of the psychological difficulty, this may be converted into an assault if the intention is to exploit the condition and embarrass the victim. More generally, if the defendant threatens injury tomorrow, the victim has the opportunity to take avoiding action. Thus, what is threatened must be capable of being carried out immediately. This would exclude a conditional threat. For example, if the defendant says that he would beat the living daylights out of you but for the presence of a police officer watching them both, the victim is supposed to understand that there is no immediate danger (''cf.'' ''[[Tuberville v Savage]]'''s "If it were not assize time I would not take such language from you"). But inequality in size can be disregarded so if a very small person threatens a very large person and it is obvious that the risk of any real injury from this attack is remote, the large person may nevertheless feel some degree of apprehension. Normally, both the one making the threat and the victim must be physically present because, otherwise, there would be no immediate danger. However, if a [[mobile phone]] is used to transmit the threat (whether orally or by [[SMS]]) and, from the words used, the victim reasonably understands that an attack is imminent, this may constitute an assault.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In ''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1968] 1 QB 439&lt;/ref&gt; a police officer ordered the defendant to park his car and he reluctantly complied. In doing so, he accidentally drove the car on to the policeman’s foot and, when asked to remove the car, said "Fuck you, you can wait" and turned off the ignition. Because of the steel toe cap in his boot, the policeman's foot was not in actual danger, but the Divisional Court held that this could constitute an assault. Albeit accidentally, the driver had caused his car to rest on the officer's foot. This ''[[actus reus]]'' was a continuing act and the ''[[mens rea]]'' was formed during the relevant time (see [[concurrence]]). Whether realistically or not, the officer apprehended the possibility of injury so the offence was complete.

In ''[[R v. Ireland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that causing a person to apprehend violence can be committed by way of action or words. ''Words'' can also mean that otherwise threatening actions are rendered not capable of being an assault, as in the case of ''[[Tuberville v. Savage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1669) 1 Mod 3, T.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the plaintiff told the defendant (while putting his hand on his sword) that he would ''not'' stab him, because the circuit judge was visiting town for the local assizes. On that basis, the defendant was deemed to have known that he was not about to be injured, and it was held that no assault had been committed by the plaintiff (which would otherwise have justified the defendant's allegedly pre-emptive strike).

The "immediacy" requirement has been the subject of some debate.  The leading case, again, is ''R v. Ireland''. Therein, the House of Lords held that the making of silent telephone calls could amount to an assault if it caused the victim to believe that physical violence might be used against him in the immediate future. One example of "immediacy" adopted by the House in that case was that a man who said, "I will be at your door in a minute or two," might (in the circumstances where those words amounted to a threat) be guilty of an assault.

See also ''[[R v. Constanza]]''.

===''Mens rea''===
The ''[[mens rea]]'' is that this fear must have been caused either [[intention (criminal law)|intentionally]] or [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]]. A battery is committed when the threatened force actually results in contact to the other and that contact was caused either intentionally or recklessly.

===Defences===

Self-defence is available when reasonable force is used to prevent harm to self or another.
Prevention of a greater crime or with the purpose of aiding a lawful arrest is also known as The Public Defence. The Private Defence or defence of property may be also be used as an argument. 
These arguments are not strictly defences but justifications for a certain level of force.

==Alternative verdict==
The original effect of sections 39 and 40 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] was that common assault was not available as an [[alternative verdict]] under section 6(3) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;R v Mearns [1991] 1 QB 82, 91 Cr App R 312, [1990] 3 WLR 569, [1990] 3 All ER 989, [1990] Crim LR 708, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

Common assault is now available as an alternative verdict under section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, by virtue of section 6(3A) of that Act (which was inserted by section 11 of the [[Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]]).

==Whether it is a statutory offence==
In ''DPP v. Taylor'' and ''DPP v. Little''&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Little'' [1992] 1 QB 645, 95 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 28&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that common assault is a statutory offence, contrary to section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. This decision was criticised&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1993 supplements and 1994 and 1996 editions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Hogan, ''Criminal Law'', 9th Ed, p.402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Smith [1991] Crim LR 900&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Haystead v DPP''&lt;ref&gt;''Haystead v DPP'' 164 JP 396, DC,[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/181.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the Divisional court expressed the ''[[obiter]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 2004. Paragraph 19-178 at page 1746.&lt;/ref&gt; opinion that common assault remains a common law offence.

==Mode of trial and sentence==
In [[England and Wales]], it is a [[summary offence]]. However, where section 40 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] applies, it can be an additional charge on an [[indictment]]. It is usually tried summarily.{{Quantify|date=February 2009}}

However it is tried, it is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|level 5]] on the [[standard scale]], or both.

See [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/common_assult/ Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual] for case law on sentencing. Relevant cases are:
*''R v [[Nottingham Crown Court]] ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions''&lt;ref&gt;''R v [[Nottingham Crown Court]] ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1996] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 283&lt;/ref&gt;
*''R v Dunn''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Dunn [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racially or religiously aggravated offence==

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c.37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated common assault]].

==Status of offence==
This is the least serious assault. It is not at all uncommon for more serious assault charges to be reduced to common assault in "plea-bargaining" by prosecutors to avoid the additional expense of a Crown Court trial should the defendant elect for same.  In real terms, the degree of fear or the level of injury required for a conviction can be unproven. No injury is required to prove battery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13438">'''Computational cognition''' (sometimes referred to as '''computational cognitive science''' or '''computational psychology''') is the study of the [[computation]]al basis of [[education|learning]] and [[inference]] by [[mathematical model]]ing, [[computer simulation]], and [[behaviorism|behavioral]] experiments. In psychology, it is an approach which develops computational models based on experimental results. It seeks to understand the basis behind the human method of [[information processing|processing of information]]. Early on computational cognitive scientists sought to bring back and create a scientific form of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano’s]] psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, C., &amp; Sokal, Michael M.|first=|date=2000|title=Dispelling the "Mystery" of Computational Cognitive Science|url=|journal=History of Psychology|volume=3 | issue = 1 |pages=62–66|via=|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.3.1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence}}
There are two main purposes for the productions of artificial intelligence: to produce intelligent behaviors regardless of the quality of the results, and to model after intelligent behaviors found in nature.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;  In the beginning of its existence, there was no need for artificial intelligence to emulate the same behavior as human cognition. Until 1960s, economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] attempted to formalize human problem-solving skills by using the results of psychological studies to develop programs that implement the same problem-solving techniques as people would. Their works laid the foundation for [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] and computational cognition, and even some advancements for [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Haugeland"/&gt;

The field of symbolic AI is based on the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]] by Simon and Newell, which states that expressing aspects of cognitive intelligence can be achieved through the manipulation of [[Physical symbol system|symbols]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt; However, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] focused more on the initial purpose of artificial intelligence, which is to breakdown the essence of logical and abstract reasoning regardless of whether or not human employs the same mechanism.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;

Over the next decades, the progress made in artificial intelligence started to be focused more on developing logic-based and knowledge-based programs, veering away from the original purpose of symbolic AI. Researchers started to believe that artificial intelligence may never be able to imitate some intricate processes of human cognition like [[Machine perception|perception]] or [[Machine learning|learning]]. A chief failing of AI is not being able to achieve a complete likeness to human cognition due to the lack of emotion and the impossibility of implementing it into an AI. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Megill|first=J.|date=2014|title=Emotion, cognition and artificial intelligence.|url=|journal=Minds And Machines|volume=24 | issue = 2 |pages=189–199|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-013-9320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;They began to take a “sub-symbolic” approach to create intelligence without specifically representing that knowledge. This movement led to the emerging discipline of [[computational model]]ing, [[connectionism]], and [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt;

==Computational modeling==
{{Main article|Computational model}}
As it contributes more to the understanding of human cognition than artificial intelligence, computational cognitive modeling emerged from the need to define various cognition functionalities (like motivation, emotion, or perception) by representing them in computational models of mechanisms and processes.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; Computational models study [[complex system]]s through the use of specific algorithms and extensive [[computational resource]]s, or variables, to produce [[computer simulation]].&lt;ref name="Simulations"/&gt; Simulation is achieved by adjusting the variables, changing one alone or even combining them together, to observe the effect on the outcomes. The results help experimenters make predictions about what would happen in the real system if those similar changes were to occur. &lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

When computational models attempt to mimic human cognitive functioning, all the details of the function must be known for them to transfer and display properly through the models, allowing researchers to thoroughly understand and test an existing theory because no variables are vague and all variables are modifiable. Consider a [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model|model of memory built by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968]], it showed how rehearsal leads to long-term memory, where the information being rehearsed would be stored. Despite the advancement it made in revealing the function of memory, this model fails to provide answers to crucial questions like: how much information can be rehearsed at a time? How long does it take for information to transfer from rehearsal to long-term memory? Similarly, other computational models raise more questions about cognition than they answer, making their contributions much less significant for the understanding of human cognition than other cognitive approaches.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; An additional shortcoming of computational modeling is its reported lack of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo Echavarria|first=R.|date=2009|title=Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.|url=|journal=Minds and Machines|volume=19 | issue = 2 |pages=181–197|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-009-9155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] in his ACT-R uses the functions of computational models and the findings of cognitive science. Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational is based on the theory that the brain consists of several modules which perform specialized functions separate of each other.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; The ACT-R model is classified as a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|symbolic]] approach to cognitive science.&lt;ref name="Polk"/&gt;

==Connectionist network==
{{Main article|Connectionism}}
Another approach which deals more with the semantic content of cognitive science is connectionism or neural network modeling. Connectionism relies on the idea that the brain consists of simple units or nodes and the behavioral response comes primarily from the layers of connections between the nodes and not from the environmental stimulus itself.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt;

Connectionist network differs from computational modeling specifically because of two functions: [[Neural backpropagation|neural back-propagation]] and [[Parallel processing (psychology)|parallel-processing]]. Neural back-propagation is a method utilized by connectionist network to show evidence of learning. After a connectionist network produce a response, the stimulated results are compared to real-life situational results. The feedback provided by the backward propagation of errors would be used to improve accuracy for the network’s subsequent responses.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The second function, parallel-processing, stemmed from the belief that knowledge and perception are not limited to specific modules but rather are distributed throughout the cognitive networks. The present of parallel distributed processing has been shown in psychological demonstrations like the [[Stroop effect]], where the brain seems to be analyzing the perception of color and meaning of language at the same time.&lt;ref name="Rumelhart"/&gt; However, this theoretical approach has been continually disproved because the two cognitive functions for color-perception and word-forming are operating separately and simultaneously, not parallel of each other.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

The field of cognition may have benefitted from the use of connectionist network but because of the completed system, setting up the neural network models can be quite a tedious task and the results may be less interpretable than the system they are trying to model. Therefore, the results can be used as evidence for broad theory of cognition without explaining the particular process happening within the cognitive function. Other disadvantages of connectionism lie in the research methods it employs or hypothesis it tests, which has been proven inaccurate or ineffective often, taking connectionist models further from an accurate representation of how the brain functions. These issues cause neural network models to be ineffective on studying higher forms of information-processing, and hinder connectionism from advancing the general understanding of human cognition.&lt;ref name="Garson"/&gt;

In [[logic]], and especially in its applications to [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], a '''counterexample''' is an exception to a proposed general rule or law. For example, consider the proposition "all students are lazy". 
Because this statement makes the claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for ''all'' students, even a ''single'' example of a diligent student will prove it false.
Thus, any hard-working student is a counterexample to "all students are lazy".
More precisely, a counterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a [[universal quantification]] (a "for all" statement).

In mathematics, this term is (by a slight abuse) also sometimes used for examples illustrating the necessity of the full hypothesis of a theorem, by considering a case where a part of the hypothesis is not verified, and where one can show that the conclusion does not hold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==In mathematics==
In mathematics, counterexamples are often used to prove the boundaries of possible theorems. By using counterexamples to show that certain conjectures are false, mathematical researchers avoid going down blind alleys and learn how to modify conjectures to produce provable theorems.

===Rectangle example===
Suppose that a mathematician is studying [[geometry]] and [[shape]]s, and she wishes to prove certain theorems about them. She [[conjecture]]s that "All [[rectangles]] are [[Square (geometry)|squares]]". She can either attempt to [[Mathematical proof|prove]] the truth of this statement using [[deductive reasoning]], or if she suspects that her conjecture is false, she might attempt to find a counterexample. In this case, a counterexample would be a rectangle that is not a square, like a rectangle with two sides of length 5 and two sides of length 7. However, despite having found rectangles that were not squares, all the rectangles she did find had four sides. She then makes the new conjecture "All rectangles have four sides". This is weaker than her original conjecture, since every square has four sides, even though not every four-sided shape is a square.

The previous paragraph explained how a mathematician might weaken her conjecture in the face of counterexamples, but counterexamples can also be used to show that the assumptions and [[hypothesis]] are needed. Suppose that after a while the mathematician in question settled on the new conjecture "All shapes that are rectangles and have four sides of equal length are squares". This conjecture has two parts to the hypothesis: the shape must be 'a rectangle' and 'have four sides of equal length' and the mathematician would like to know if she can remove either assumption and still maintain the truth of her conjecture. So she needs to check the truth of the statements: (1) "All shapes that are rectangles are squares" and (2) "All shapes that have four sides of equal length are squares". A counterexample to (1) was already given, and a counterexample to (2) is a non-square [[rhombus]]. Thus the mathematician sees that both assumptions were necessary.

===Other mathematical examples===
{{See also|Counterexamples in topology|Minimal counterexample}}

A counterexample to the statement "all [[prime number]]s are [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]]" is the number 2, as it is a prime number but is not an odd number. Neither of the numbers 7 or 10 is a counterexample, as neither contradicts the statement. In this example, 2 is the only possible counterexample to the statement, but only a single example is needed to contradict "''All'' prime numbers are odd numbers". Similarly the statement "All [[natural number]]s are either [[Prime number|prime]] or [[Composite number|composite]]" has the number 1 as a counterexample as 1 is neither prime nor composite.

[[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]] was disproved by counterexample. It asserted that at least ''n'' ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers were necessary to sum to another ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lander, Parkin|year=1966|title=Counterexample to Euler's conjecture on sums of like powers|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|publisher=Americal Mathematical Society|volume=72|page=1079|issn=0273-0979|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1966-72-06/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a counterexample involving ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5; other ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 counterexamples are now known, as are some ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 counterexamples.

[[Witsenhausen's counterexample]] shows that it is not always true for [[control theory|control problems]] that a quadratic [[loss function]] and a linear equation of evolution of the [[state variable]] imply optimal control laws that are linear.

Other examples include the disproofs of the [[Seifert conjecture]], the [[Pólya conjecture]], the conjecture of [[Hilbert's fourteenth problem]], [[Tait's conjecture]], and the [[Ganea conjecture]].

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], counterexamples are usually used to argue that a certain philosophical position is wrong by showing that it does not apply in certain cases. Unlike [[mathematician]]s, philosophers cannot prove their claims beyond any doubt, so other philosophers are free to disagree and try to find counterexamples in response. Of course, now the first philosopher can argue that the alleged counterexample does not really apply.

Alternatively, the first philosopher can modify their claim so that the counterexample no longer applies; this is analogous to when a mathematician modifies a conjecture because of a counterexample.

For example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', [[Callicles]], trying to define what it means to say that some people are "better" than others, claims that those who are stronger are better.

But [[Socrates]] replies that, because of their strength of numbers, the class of common rabble is stronger than the propertied class of nobles, even though the masses are [[prima facie]] of worse character. Thus Socrates has proposed a counterexample to Callicles' claim, by looking in an area that Callicles perhaps did not expect — groups of people rather than individual persons.

Callicles might challenge Socrates' counterexample, arguing perhaps that the common rabble really are better than the nobles, or that even in their large numbers, they still are not stronger. But if Callicles accepts the counterexample, then he must either withdraw his claim or modify it so that the counterexample no longer applies. For example, he might modify his claim to refer only to individual persons, requiring him to think of the common people as a collection of individuals rather than as a mob.

As it happens, he modifies his claim to say "wiser" instead of "stronger", arguing that no amount of numerical superiority can make people wiser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5847">'''Counterphobic attitude''' is a response to [[anxiety]] that, instead of fleeing the source of fear in the manner of a [[phobia]], actively seeks it out, in the hope of overcoming the original anxiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 480-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the [[avoidant personality disorder]], the counterphobic represents the less usual, but not totally uncommon, response of seeking out what is feared:&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kantor, ''The Essential Guide to Overcoming Avoidant Personality Disorder'' (2010) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[codependents]] may fall into a subcategory of this group, hiding their fears of [[attachment theory|attachment]] in over-dependency.&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==

Dare-devil activities are often undertaken in a counterphobic spirit, as a denial of the fears attached to them, which may be only partially successful.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acting out]] in general may have a counterphobic source,&lt;ref&gt;Judy Cooper, ''Speak of Me as I Am'' (2011) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a [[false self]] over-concerned with compulsive doing to preserve a sense of power and control.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex is a key area for counterphobic activity, sometimes powering [[hypersexuality]] in people who are actually afraid of the objects they believe they love.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents, fearing [[Making out|sex play]], may jump over to a kind of spurious full sexuality;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; adults may overvalue sex to cover an unconscious fear of the harm it may do.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Segal, ''Melanie Klein'' (2001) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Such a counterphobic approach may indeed be socially celebrated&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., '' Sex and Sexuality'' (2010) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; in a postmodern vision of sex as gymnastic performance or hygiene,&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Philosophy in Turbulent Times'' (2008) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; fuelled by what [[Ken Wilber]] described as "an exuberant and fearless [[Superficiality|shallowness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wilber, ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'' (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic accidents have been linked to a counterphobic, [[Mania|manic]] attitude in the driver.&lt;ref&gt;Graham P. Bartley, ''Traffic Accidents'' (2008) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

[[Julia Kristeva]] considered that language could be used by the developing child as a counterphobic object,&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror'' (1982) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2013}} protecting against anxiety and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 82-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ego psychology]] points out that through the ambiguities of language, the concrete meanings of words may break down the counterphobic attitude and return the child to a state of fear.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (1987) p. 123-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==

[[Didier Anzieu]] saw Freud's theorisation of [[psychoanalysis]] as a counterphobic defence against anxiety through intellectualisation: permanently ruminating on the instinctive, emotional world that was the actual object of fear.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Anzieu, ''Freud's Self-Analysis'' (1986) p. 182 and p. 577-581&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Fliess]] has been seen as playing the role of counterphobic object for Freud during the period of the latter's self-analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Flem, ''Freud the Man'' (2003) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

[[Otto Fenichel]] considered that undoing systematised counterphobic defences was only a first step in therapy, needing to be followed by analysis of the original anxiety itself.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered that [[psychological trauma]] could break down counterphobic defences, with results that "may be very painful for the patient; they are, from a therapeutic point of view, favorable".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 549-53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Rapaport]] emphasised the need for caution and extreme slowness in analyzing counterphobic defences.&lt;ref&gt;David Rapaport, 'The Autonomy of the Ego', in Glen T. Morris ed., ''Dimensions of Psychology'' (nd) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

The attraction of [[horror movies]] has been seen to lie in a counterphobic impulse.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Newman, ''Transgressions of Reading'' (1993) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors often have a [[Shyness|shy]] personality, released counterphobically in conditions of performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist|Sick]], the documentary on masochistic performance artist Bob Flanagan, discusses the counterphobic attitude of Flanagan, who sought to escape the chronic pain of his cystic fibrosis by engaging in extreme acts of masochism.

A '''disassembler''' is a [[computer program]] that translates [[machine language]] into [[assembly language]]—the inverse operation to that of an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]]. A disassembler differs from a [[decompiler]], which targets a [[high-level language]] rather than an assembly language. Disassembly, the output of a disassembler, is often formatted for human-readability rather than suitability for input to an assembler, making it principally a [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] tool.

Assembly language [[source code]] generally permits the use of [[constant (programming)|constant]]s and programmer [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]s. These are usually removed from the assembled [[machine code]] by the assembler. If so, a disassembler operating on the machine code would produce disassembly lacking these constants and comments; the disassembled output becomes more difficult for a human to interpret than the original annotated source code. Some disassemblers provide a built-in code commenting feature where the generated output gets enriched with comments regarding called API functions or parameters of called functions. Some disassemblers make use of the [[symbolic debugging]] information present in object files such as [[Executable and Linking Format|ELF]]. For example, [[Interactive Disassembler|IDA]] allows the human user to make up mnemonic symbols for values or regions of code in an interactive session: human insight applied to the disassembly process often parallels human creativity in the code writing process.

On [[complex instruction set computer|CISC]] platforms with variable-width instructions, more than one disassembly may be correct. Disassemblers do not handle code that varies during execution.

==Problems of disassembly==
Writing a disassembler which produces code which, when assembled, produces exactly the original binary is possible; however, there are often differences. This poses demands on the expressivity of the assembler. For example, an x86 assembler takes an arbitrary choice between two binary codes for something as simple as &lt;code&gt;MOV AX,BX&lt;/code&gt;. If the original code uses the other choice, the original code simply cannot be reproduced at any given point in time. However, even when a fully correct disassembly is produced, problems remain if the program requires modification. For example, the same machine language jump instruction can be generated by assembly code to jump to a specified location (for example, to execute specific code), or to jump to a specified number of bytes (for example, to skip over an unwanted branch). A disassembler cannot know what is intended, and may use either syntax to generate a disassembly which reproduces the original binary. However, if a programmer wants to add instructions between the jump instruction and its destination, it is necessary to understand the program's operation to determine whether the jump should be absolute or relative, i.e., whether its destination should remain at a fixed location, or be moved so as to skip both the original and added instructions.

== Examples of disassemblers ==
&lt;!-- ...that are well-known, *and* have Wikipedia articles. --&gt;
A disassembler may be stand-alone or interactive. A stand-alone disassembler, when executed, generates an assembly language file which can be examined; an interactive one shows the effect of any change the user makes immediately. For example, the disassembler may initially not know that a section of the program is actually code, and treat it as data; if the user specifies that it is code, the resulting disassembled code is shown immediately, allowing the user to examine it and take further action during the same run.

Any interactive [[debugger]] will include some way of viewing the disassembly of the program being debugged. Often, the same disassembly tool will be packaged as a standalone disassembler distributed along with the debugger. For example, [[objdump]], part of [[GNU Binutils]], is related to the interactive debugger [[gdb]].

== Disassemblers and emulators==
A dynamic disassembler can be incorporated into the output of an [[emulator]] or [[hypervisor]] to 'trace out', line-by-line, the real time execution of any executed machine instructions. In this case, as well as lines containing the disassembled machine code, the register(s) and/or data change(s) (or any other changes of "[[state (computer science)|state]]", such as condition codes) that each individual instruction causes can be shown alongside or beneath the disassembled instruction. This provides extremely powerful debugging information for ultimate problem resolution, although the size of the resultant output can sometimes be quite large, especially if active for an entire program's execution. OLIVER provided these features from the early 1970s as part of its [[CICS]] debugging product offering and is now to be found incorporated into the [[XPEDITER]] product from [[Compuware]].

{{About|the prejudicial treatment}}
{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
In human [[social behavior|social affairs]], '''discrimination''' is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction towards, a person based on the group, class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong. These include [[ageing|age]], [[skin color|colour]], [[convictions]]  for which a pardon has been granted or a record suspended, [[height]], [[disability]], [[ethnicity]], [[family|family status]], [[gender identity]], [[Genetics|genetic characteristics]], [[marital|marital status]], [[nationality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/eng/content/what-discrimination-1 |title=What is Discrimination? |publisher=Canadian Human Rights Commission |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415190505/https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/eng/content/what-discrimination-1 |archive-date=2018-04-15 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination consists of treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, "in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=discrimination, definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/discrimination |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the [[social exclusion|exclusion]] of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]].

==Etymology==
The term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term "discrimination" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to sociology |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc. |year=2009 |edition=7th |location=New York |page=324 |medium=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Discrimination" derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means "to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction".

==Definitions==
Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way despite the fact that the people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lippert-Rasmussen |first=Kasper |year=2006 |title=Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account |journal=San Diego Law Review |volume=43 |pages=817–856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1755-2567.2010.01080.x|title = Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion| journal=Theoria| volume=76| issue=4| pages=314–332|year = 2010|last1 = Horta|first1 = Oscar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nVIJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=equality|title=Anti-Discriminatory Practice: Equality, Diversity and Social Justice|last=Thompson|first=Neil|date=2016-05-12|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137586667|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on realistic-conflict theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Group conflict and co-operation |last=Sherif |first=M. |publisher=Routledge |year=1967 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social-identity theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The social psychology of intergroup relations |last=Tajfel |first=H. |last2=Turner |first2=J.

# ''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# ''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# ''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy{{clarify|date=February 2012}} and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the statement:  "Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |title=United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601211521/http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |archivedate=2014-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International bodies [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

==Types==

===Age===
{{Main|Ageism|Adultism}}
Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Ageism|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person's age.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickKatsiaficas1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=George R.|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George N.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Robert George|author4=Mary Lou Emery|title=Introduction to critical sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdf2QupEaHgC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1987|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8290-1595-9|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is most often directed towards old people, or adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, Thirty Years of Ageism Research. In Nelson T (ed). Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"]. youthrights.org. Retrieved on 11 April 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105250/http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States.  Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414230847/https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at [[Ghent University]], measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M. (In press) [http://users.ugent.be/~sbaert/BaertNorgaThuyVanHecke_GettingGreyHairs_JEP.pdf Getting Grey Hairs in the Labour Market: An Alternative Experiment on Age Discrimination] Journal of Economic Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey for the [[University of Kent]], England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination.  This is a higher proportion than for [[Sexism|gender]] or [[Racism|racial]] discrimination. [[Dominic Abrams]], social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf How Ageist is Britain?] London: Age Concern. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027165812/http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf |date=October 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste===
{{See also|Caste}}

According to [[UNICEF]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], [[caste]] discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/29/global1815.htm|title=Global Caste Discrimination|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm Caste - The Facts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811033342/http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm |date=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based on caste, as perceived by [[UNICEF]], is mainly prevalent in parts of [[Asia]], ([[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Japan]]), [[Africa]] and others.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there were 200 million [[Dalit]]s or [[Scheduled Castes]] (formerly known as "untouchables") in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsn.org/news-resources/idsn-news/read/article/india-official-dalit-population-exceeds-200-million/128/|title=India: Official Dalit population exceeds 200 million|date=29 May 2013|publisher=International Dalit Solidarity Network|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with [[Disability|disabilities]] in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of 'normal living', results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown, employment is needed to not only provide a living but to sustain mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vornholt|first=Katharina|author2=Sjir Uitdewilligen |author3=Frans J.N. Nijhuis |title=Factors Affecting the Acceptance of People with Disabilities at Work: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation|date=December 2013|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–75|doi=10.1007/s10926-013-9426-0|pmid=23400588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce isolation.

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Language===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists in [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs in [[French language|French]].]]
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Notable examples are the [[Anti-French sentiment in the United States]] as well as the [[Anti-Quebec sentiment]] in Canada targeting people who speak the French language. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who either do or do not speak a particular language or languages.

Another noteworthy example of linguistic discrimination is the backdrop to the [[Bengali language movement|Bengali Language Movement]] in erstwhile Pakistan, a political campaign that played a key role in the creation of [[Bangladesh]]. In 1948, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] declared [[Urdu]] as the national language of [[Pakistan]] and branded those supporting the use of [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the most widely spoken language in the state, as enemies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[1971 Bangladesh genocide#CITEREFHossainTollefson2006|Hossain &amp; Tollefson 2006]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''.{{by whom|date=January 2012}} Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or "official" language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Name===
Discrimination based on a person's name may also occur, with research suggesting the presence of discrimination based on name meaning, pronunciation, uniqueness, gender affiliation, and racial affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Silberzhan | first1 =Raphael | title =It Pays to be Herr Kaiser | journal =Psychological Science | volume =24 | issue =12 | pages =2437–2444 | date =May 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Laham | first =Simon | title =The name-pronunciation effect: Why people like Mr. Smith more than Mr. Colquhoun | journal =Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume=48 | issue =2012 | pages =752–756 | date =December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cotton | first =John  | title =The "name game": affective and hiring reactions to first names | journal =Journal of Managerial Psychology | volume =23 | issue =1 | pages =18–39 | date =July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bertrand | first =Marianne | title =Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamaal? | journal =The American Economic Review | volume =94 | issue =4 | pages =991–1013 |  date =September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Easton | first=Stephen | title=Blind recruiting study suggests positive discrimination common in the APS | newspaper=The Mandarin | publisher=The Mandarin | date=June 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each résumé before making their initial "fit/no fit" screen-out decision and that a person's name is one of the six things they focus on most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first =Jacquelyn | title =Here's What Recruiters Look At In The 6 Seconds They Spend On Your Résumé | newspaper =Business Insider | publisher =Business Insider | date =November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  France has made it illegal to view a person's name on a résumé when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates. Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands have also experimented with name-blind résumé processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =No names, no bias | newspaper =The Economist | publisher =The Economist | date =October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some apparent discrimination may be explained by other factors such as name frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Silberzhan | first1=Raphael | last2=Simonsohn | first2=Uri | last3=Uhlmann| first3=Eric| title =Matched-Names Analysis Reveals No Evidence of Name-Meaning Effects: A Collaborative Commentary on Silberzahn and Uhlmann | journal = Psychological Science | volume =25 | issue =7 | pages =1504–1505 | date =February 4, 2014|url=http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/Silberzahn_Simonsohn_Uhlmann_2014_Collaborative_Commentary_and_Online_Supplement.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of name discrimination based on name fluency is subtle, small and subject significantly to changing norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =The Power of Names | newspaper =The New York Times | publisher=The New York Times | date =May 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationality===
Discrimination on the basis of [[nationality]] is usually included in [[Employment discrimination|employment laws]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm Race, Color, National Origin and Ancestry], State of Wisconsin {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024061935/http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see above [[Discrimination#Employment|section for employment discrimination]] specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and National Origin Discrimination|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/race-origin.html|website=Office for Civil Rights|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a "level of acceptance" in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Schwieren, [http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/39/6/643.abstract Mechanisms Underlying Nationality-Based Discrimination in Teams.

In the [[UAE]] and other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states, for instance, nationality is not frequently given to residents and expatriates. In the workplace, preferential treatment is given to full citizens, even though many of them lack experience or motivation to do the job. State benefits are also generally available for citizens only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn|title=Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn|author=Ayesha Almazroui|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, aboriginal people ([[First Nations]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], and [[Inuit]]) comprise 4 percent of [[Canada]]'s population, but they account for 23.2 percent of the federal prison population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oci-bec.gc.ca/cnt/rpt/oth-aut/oth-aut20121022info-eng.aspx| title=Aboriginal Offenders: A Critical Situation | publisher=Office of the Correctional Investigator, Government of Canada|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Australian government's June 2006 publication of prison statistics, [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] make up 24% of the overall prison population in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4517.0Main+Features12006?OpenDocument| title=Prisoners in Australia, 2006| publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics| date=2006-12-14| accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Māori people|Māori]] made up just 15% of the total population of [[New Zealand]] but 49.5% of prisoners. Māori were entering prison at eight times the rate of non-Māori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41654.htm|title=New Zealand|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarter of the people in [[England]]'s prisons are from an ethnic minority. The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] found that in England and Wales {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, a black person was five times more likely to be imprisoned than a white person. The discrepancy was attributed to "decades of racial prejudice in the criminal justice system".&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh, Randeep.

In the United States, [[racial profiling]] of minorities by law-enforcement officials has been called racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;

===Region===
{{see also|Regional discrimination in China}}
Regional or geographic discrimination is discrimination based on the region in which a person lives or was born. It differs from national discrimination in that it may not be based on national borders or the country the victim lives in, but is instead based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese born in countryside far from city within China, and discrimination against [[Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|southern]] or [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Accent"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/accent-discrimination/ | title=Accent Discrimination Law and Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
{{Main|Religious discrimination}}

{{Status of religious freedom}}
[[File:Lotshampa refugees in Beldangi Camp.jpg|thumb|In the 1990s, [[Bhutan]] [[Bhutanese refugees|expelled or forced to leave]] its Hindu population in the name of preserving its Buddhist culture and identity.]]
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the [[Balkans]], known as the "rayah" or the "protected flock", was discriminated against under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|Was this "discrimination" only expressed by the meaning of a single word? If so, this can hardly be an illustrative example of religious discrimination and should be replaced with a better example.|date=November 2015}}

Restrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]". National Geographic News. July 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and were not allowed to own land.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied "the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington. D.C., April 9–10, 1979''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex, sex characteristics, gender, and gender identity===
{{Main|Sexism}}
{{See also|Misogyny|Misandry|Discrimination against intersex people|Transphobia||Discrimination towards non-binary gender persons}}

Though gender discrimination and sexism refer to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender. [[Image:OECD gender wage gap.svg|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[OECD]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|title=OECD Employment Outlook 2008 – Statistical Annex OECD, Paris|year=2008|page=358|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206221033/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|archivedate= December 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Glott, R., Schmidt, P., &amp; Ghosh, R. A.|date=March 2010|title=Wikipedia survey—Overview of results|work=UNI-MERIT| url=http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|archivedate=April 14, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for [[systemic bias]]. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reagle, J., &amp; Rhue, L.|year=2011|title=Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Britannica|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|pages=1138–1158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, F.|year=2003|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|edition=2nd|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754609001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/sex-discrimination|title=Sex Discrimination|website=Citation.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = J.

Gregory, ''Women and Workplace Discrimination: Overcoming Barriers to Gender Equality,'' Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a "[[glass ceiling]]" and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''Glass Ceilings and Open Doors,'' Fordham Law Review,  64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, ''The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40&lt;/ref&gt; The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin ''Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,'' Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: "Over half of all Master's degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling Commission"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, women accounted for 51% of workers in high-paying management, professional, and related occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/QS-womenwork2010.htm Quick Stats on Women Workers, 2010]". [[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Employment and Earnings, 2010 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, women are found to experience a [[sticky floor]]. While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution. It might be explained by both employer discrimination and gender differences in career aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N. (Forthcoming) [Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors?] Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex]] persons experience [[Discrimination against intersex people|discrimination]] due to innate, atypical [[sex characteristics]]. Multiple jurisdictions now protect individuals on grounds of ''intersex status'' or ''[[sex characteristics]]''. South Africa was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005], Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town, 11 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="expmem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fems%2Fr5026_ems_1fcd9245-33ff-4b3a-81b9-7fdc7eb91b9b%22 |title=Australian Parliament, Explanatory Memorandum to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Bill 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219231017/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bquery%3DId%3A%22legislation/ems/r5026_ems_1fcd9245-33ff-4b3a-81b9-7fdc7eb91b9b%22 |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/21774/welcome-senate-inquiry-anti-discrimination/ We welcome the Senate Inquiry report on the Exposure Draft of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Malta was the first to adopt a broader framework of 'sex characteristics', through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transactivists.org/2015/04/08/making-depathologization-a-matter-of-law-a-comment-from-gate-on-the-maltese-act-on-gender-identity-gender-expression-and-sex-characteristics/ |title=Making depathologization a matter of law.

[[Transgender]] individuals, whether male-to-female, female-to-male, or [[genderqueer]], often experience [[transphobia|transphobic]] problems that often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. 

Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as "women's jobs". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;''Noack v YMCA of Greater Houston Area'', 132, S. Ct.425 (US, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and black people in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.{{Update inline|date=October 2018|reason=The case mentioned has most likely been decided.|?=yes}}

Discrimination in slasher films is relevant. Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive, thus reinforcing the idea that female sexuality can be costly.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|author2=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One's sexual orientation is a "predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality".&lt;ref&gt;''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against [[asexuality|asexuals]] than to homosexuals or bisexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country.

A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

In the US, a government policy known as [[affirmative action]] was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as [[African Americans]] and women, who have been subject to discrimination for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography on Race, Gender and Affirmative Action|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/biblio.htm |work=Race, Gender, and Affirmative Action|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as reverse discrimination. In particular, minority quotas (for example, [[affirmative action]]) may discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group or other minority groups. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, "There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html American Civil Rights Institute | Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214072218/http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html |date=December 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations documents===
Important UN documents addressing discrimination include:
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is a declaration adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1948. It states that:" ''Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html The Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) is a United Nations convention. The Convention commits its members to the elimination of [[racial discrimination]]. The convention was adopted and opened for signature by the United Nations General Assembly on 21 December 1965, and entered into force on 4 January 1969.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is an international human rights instrument treaty of the United Nations. Parties to the Convention are required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the law. The text was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006, and opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Following ratification by the 20th party, it came into force on 3 May 2008.

==Theories==
[[Social theories]] such as [[egalitarianism]] assert that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |title=Civil rights |accessdate=2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, "abolitionist" or "vegan" egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is "[[speciesist]]".&lt;ref name="singerethics-sentience"&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Ethics |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-43971-8 |edition=Second |pages=57–58 |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. ... This is why the limit of sentience&amp;nbsp;... is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. ... Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species.|title-link=Practical Ethics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a "natural" social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} The [[Nazis]] in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=Heribert|title=Anti-Semitism and Anti-Black Racism: Nazi Germany and Apartheid South Africa|journal=Telos|date=1 July 1996|volume=1996|issue=108|pages=25–46|doi=10.3817/0696108025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game theory===
Economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] (2013) argues that "discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics
evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory", and that neither classical [[game theory]] nor [[neoclassical economics]] can explain this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 11: Evolving domination in the laboratory

|title=Economic Indeterminacy: A personal encounter with the economists' peculiar nemesis
|series=Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy
|isbn=978-0415668491
|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap (2002) ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround [[hawk-dove game]] (HD game).  At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue.  At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent.  Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the "advantaged" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive "hawk" strategy against players of the other, "disadvantaged" color, who played the acquiescent "dove" strategy against the advantaged color.  Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.

The experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not.  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group.  Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a "fairness" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]

==State vs. free market==

It is debated as to whether or not [[market (economics)|markets]] discourage discrimination brought about by the state. One argument is that since discrimination restricts access to customers and incurs additional expense, market logic will punish discrimination. Opposition by companies to "Jim Crow" segregation laws is an example of this.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, "The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars." Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative argument is that markets don't necessarily undermine discrimination, as it is argued that if discrimination is profitable by catering to the "tastes" of individuals (which is the point of the market), then the market will not punish discrimination. It is argued that microeconomic analysis of discrimination uses unusual methods to determine its effects (using explicit treatment of production functions) and that the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) in the long run contradicts claims that the market will function well and punish discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Toikka, The Welfare Implications of Becker’s Discrimination Coefficient, 13 J. ECON. THEORY 472, 472 (1976);  Glen G. Cain, The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey, in 1 HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Richard Layard eds., 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For review of the literature in regard to the last two points see [http://www.glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf Menahem Pasternak, Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications, 33 N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98927">'''Emotionally focused therapy''' and '''emotion-focused therapy''' ('''EFT''') are a family of related approaches to [[psychotherapy]] with individuals, couples, or families. EFT approaches include elements of experiential therapy (such as [[person-centered therapy]] and [[Gestalt therapy]]), [[systemic therapy]], and [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples of ''psychotherapy survey textbooks'' that have covered one or more EFT approaches include: {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=233–261, 385–389}}; {{harvnb|Corey|2013|pp=83–92}}; {{harvnb|Goldenberg|Goldenberg|2013|pp=267–272}}; {{harvnb|Wedding|Corsini|2013|pp=102–103}}; {{harvnb|Gehart|2014|pp=449–465}}; {{harvnb|Prochaska|Norcross|2014|pp=161–168}}; {{harvnb|Corey|2015|pp=167–168, 480}}. Examples of texts on ''EFT for individuals'' include: {{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2015}}. Texts on ''EFT for couples'' (sometimes called EFT-C) include: {{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Ruzgyte|Spinks|2011}}. Examples of texts on ''EFT for families'' (sometimes called EFFT) include: {{harvnb|Heatherington|Friedlander|Greenberg|2005}}; {{harvnb|Sexton|Schuster|2008}}; {{harvnb|Stavrianopoulos|Faller|Furrow|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; EFT is usually a short-term treatment (8–20 sessions).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1992|pp=220–221, 223}}; {{harvnb|Goldenberg|Goldenberg|2013|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT approaches are based on the premise that human [[emotion]]s are connected to human [[need]]s, and therefore emotions have an innately adaptive potential that, if activated and worked through, can help people change problematic emotional states and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;The connection between human needs and emotions is explored in, for example: {{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987}}; {{harvnb|Safran|Greenberg|1991}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2002a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Flanagan|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emotion-focused therapy'' for individuals was originally known as '''process-experiential therapy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prochaska|Norcross|2014|p=162}}; examples of early texts using the term ''process-experiential'' include: {{harvnb|Rice|Greenberg|1990|p=404}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is still sometimes called by that name.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Wedding|Corsini|2013|pp=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFT should not be confused with ''emotion-focused coping'', a category of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] proposed by some psychologists,&lt;ref&gt;Emotion-focused coping is typically contrasted with problem-focused coping and relationship-focused coping, for example: {{harvnb|Folkman|Lazarus|Gruen|DeLongis|1986|p=571}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2007|p=391}}; {{harvnb|Morgan|2008|p=185}}; {{harvnb|Cormier|Nurius|Osborn|2013|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; although clinicians have used EFT to help improve clients' emotion-focused coping.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Baker|Berenbaum|2008|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Baker|Berenbaum|2011|p=554}}; {{harvnb|Stanton|2011|pp=370, 378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
EFT began in the mid-1980s as an approach to helping couples. EFT was originally formulated and tested by [[Sue Johnson]] and [[Les Greenberg]] in 1985,&lt;ref name="Locus classicus"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1985a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1985b}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1987}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first manual for emotionally focused [[couples therapy]] was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop the approach, Johnson and Greenberg began reviewing videos of sessions of couples therapy to identify, through observation and [[task analysis]], the elements that lead to positive change. They were influenced in their observations by the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] experiential psychotherapies of [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Fritz Perls]], both of whom valued (in different ways) present-moment emotional experience for its power to create meaning and guide behavior.&lt;ref name="Johnson et al. 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Bradley|Furrow|Lee|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson and Greenberg saw the need to combine experiential therapy with the [[Systems theory|systems theoretical]] view that [[meaning-making]] and behavior cannot be considered outside of the whole situation in which they occur.&lt;ref name="Johnson et al. 13"/&gt; In this "experiential–systemic" approach to couples therapy, as in other approaches to [[systemic therapy]], the problem is viewed as belonging not to one partner, but rather to the cyclical reinforcing patterns of interactions between partners.&lt;ref name="Fromme 367"&gt;{{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=367–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotion is viewed not only as a within-individual phenomena, but also as part of the whole system that organizes the interactions between partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Greenberg chose "to refocus his efforts on developing and studying an experiential approach to individual therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg and colleagues shifted their attention away from couples therapy toward individual psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;The major books that they published during this period include: {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attended to emotional experiencing and its role in individual self-organization. Building on the experiential theories of Rogers and Perls and others such as [[Eugene Gendlin]], as well as on their own extensive work on [[information processing]] and the adaptive role of emotion in human functioning, {{harvtxt|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}} created a treatment manual with numerous clearly outlined principles for what they called a ''process-experiential'' approach to psychological change. {{harvtxt|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Goldman|Greenberg|2015}} have further expanded the process-experiential approach, with detailed manuals of specific methods of therapeutic intervention. {{harvtxt|Goldman|Greenberg|2015}} presents [[case formulation]] maps for this approach.

Johnson continued to develop EFT for couples, integrating [[attachment theory]] with systemic and humanistic approaches,&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly expanding attachment theory's understanding of love relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Attachment theory of love relationships is outlined in, for example: {{harvnb|Mikulincer|Shaver|2016}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's model retained the original three stages and nine steps and two sets of interventions that aim to reshape the attachment bond: one set of interventions to track and restructure patterns of interaction and one to access and reprocess emotion (see {{section link||Stages and steps}} below).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1986}}; {{harvnb|Goldenberg|Goldenberg|2013|pp=267–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's goal is the creation of positive cycles of interpersonal interaction wherein individuals are able to ask for and offer comfort and support to safe others, facilitating interpersonal emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2009a"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Greenberg|Goldman|2008}} developed a variation of EFT for couples that contains some elements from Greenberg and Johnson's original formulation but adds several steps and stages. Greenberg and Goldman posit three motivational dimensions—(1) attachment, (2) [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or [[Power (social and political)|power]], and (3) [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]] or [[Reciprocal liking|liking]]—that impact emotion regulation in intimate relationships.&lt;ref name="Three dimensions"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|pp=4–7}}; {{harvnb|Woldarsky Meneses|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|pp=64–67}}; {{harvnb|Woldarsky Meneses|Greenberg|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar terminology, different meanings==
The terms ''emotion-focused therapy'' and ''emotionally focused therapy'' have different meanings for different therapists.

In [[Les Greenberg]]'s approach the term ''emotion-focused'' is sometimes used to refer to psychotherapy approaches in general that emphasize emotion. Greenberg "decided that on the basis of the development in emotion theory that treatments such as the process experiential approach, as well as some other approaches that emphasized emotion as the target of change, were sufficiently similar to each other and different from existing approaches to merit being grouped under the general title of emotion-focused approaches."&lt;ref name="Greenberg &amp; Goldman x"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and colleague Rhonda Goldman noted their choice to "use the more American phrasing of ''emotion-focused'' to refer to therapeutic approaches that focused on emotion, rather than the original, possibly more English term (reflecting both Greenberg's and Johnson's backgrounds) ''emotionally focused''."&lt;ref name="Greenberg &amp; Goldman x"/&gt; Greenberg uses the term ''emotion-focused'' to suggest [[Integrative psychotherapy#Assimilative integration|assimilative integration]] of an emotional focus into any approach to psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2002b}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2008}}; {{harvnb|Thoma|McKay|2015|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the focus on emotions to be a [[Common factors theory|common factor]] among various systems of psychotherapy: "The term ''emotion-focused therapy'' will, I believe, be used in the future, in its integrative sense, to characterize all therapies that are emotion-focused, be they [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], [[Systemic therapy|systemic]], or humanistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2011|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg co-authored a chapter on the importance of [[Practitioner–scholar model|research by clinicians]] and [[Integrative psychotherapy|integration of psychotherapy approaches]] that stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to these empirical findings, leaders of major orientations have voiced serious criticisms of their preferred theoretical approaches, while encouraging an open-minded attitude toward other orientations.... Furthermore, clinicians of different orientations recognized that their approaches did not provide them with the clinical repertoire sufficient to address the diversity of clients and their presenting problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boswell|Sharpless|Greenberg|Heatherington|2014|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sue Johnson]]'s use of the term ''emotionally focused therapy'' refers to a specific model of [[relationship therapy]] that explicitly integrates [[Systemic therapy|systems]] and experiential approaches and places prominence upon [[attachment theory]] as a theory of emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Gehart|2014|pp=449–465}}; {{harvnb|Goldenberg|Goldenberg|2013|pp=267–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson views attachment needs as a primary motivational system for mammalian survival; her approach to EFT focuses on attachment theory as a theory of adult love wherein attachment, caregiving, and sex are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaver|Mikulincer|2006}}; {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=384–390}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory is seen to subsume the search for personal autonomy, dependability of the other and a sense of personal and interpersonal attractiveness, lovability and desire. Johnson's approach to EFT aims to reshape attachment strategies towards optimal interdependency and emotion regulation, for resilience and physical, emotional, and relational health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Lafontaine|Dalgleish|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Experiential focus===
All EFT approaches have retained emphasis on the importance of [[Rogerian therapy|Rogerian]] empathic attunement and communicated understanding. They all focus upon the value of engaging clients in emotional experiencing moment-to-moment in session.&lt;ref&gt;Client experiencing can be measured, for example, by the Client Experiencing Scale ({{harvnb|Klein|Mathieu-Coughlan|Kiesler|1986}}), the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale ({{harvnb|Lane|Quinlan|Schwartz|Walker|1990}}), or the Assimilation of Problematic Experiences Scale ({{harvnb|Honos-Webb|Stiles|Greenberg|Goldman|1998}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an experiential focus is prominent in all EFT approaches.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|Pos|2005}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009b}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Bohart|Watson|Greenberg|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All EFT theorists have expressed the view that individuals engage with others on the basis of their emotions, and construct a sense of self from the drama of repeated emotionally laden interactions.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2009a"/&gt;

The information-processing theory of emotion and emotional appraisal (in accordance with emotion theorists such as [[Magda B. Arnold]], [[Paul Ekman]], [[Nico Frijda]], and [[James Gross]]) and the humanistic, experiential emphasis on moment-to-moment [[emotional expression]] (developing the earlier psychotherapy approaches of [[Carl Rogers]], [[Fritz Perls]], and [[Eugene Gendlin]]) have been strong components of all EFT approaches since their inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT approaches value emotion as the target and agent of change, honoring the intersection of emotion, cognition, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT approaches posit that emotion is the first, often subconscious response to experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987|pp=62–64, 127–128}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2004|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Bradley|Furrow|Lee|2005|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All EFT approaches also use the framework of primary and secondary (reactive) emotion responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=233–261}}; {{harvnb|Gehart|2014|pp=449–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maladaptive emotion responses and negative patterns of interaction===
Greenberg and some other EFT theorists have categorized emotion responses into four types (see {{section link||Emotion response types}} below) to help therapists decide how to respond to a client at a particular time: ''primary adaptive'', ''primary maladaptive'', ''secondary reactive'', and ''instrumental''.&lt;ref name="Types"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=28–32}}; {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=236–237}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2012|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg has posited six principles of emotion processing: (1) awareness of emotion or naming what one feels, (2) [[emotional expression]], (3) [[regulation of emotion]], (4) [[Self-reflection|reflection]] on experience, (5) transformation of emotion by emotion, and (6) corrective experience of emotion through new lived experiences in therapy and in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2010|pp=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; While primary adaptive emotion responses are seen as a reliable guide for behavior in the present situation, primary maladaptive emotion responses are seen as an unreliable guide for behavior in the present situation (alongside other possible emotional difficulties such as lack of emotional awareness, emotion dysregulation, and problems in [[meaning-making]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson rarely distinguishes between adaptive and maladaptive primary emotion responses,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1994|pp=13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely distinguishes emotion responses as dysfunctional or functional.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|2004|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, primary emotional responses are usually construed as normal survival reactions in the face of what [[John Bowlby]] called "separation distress".&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|1986}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenman|2006|p=599}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Lafontaine|Dalgleish|2015|p=414}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016|pp=29, 417–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT for couples, like other systemic therapies that emphasize [[interpersonal relationship]]s, presumes that the patterns of interpersonal interaction are the problematic or dysfunctional element.&lt;ref name="Fromme 367"/&gt; The patterns of interaction are amenable to change after accessing the underlying primary emotion responses that are subconsciously driving the ineffective, negative reinforcing cycles of interaction. Validating reactive emotion responses and reprocessing newly accessed primary emotion responses is part of the change process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual therapy==
[[File:Counselling session.jpg|thumb|upright|Individual therapy]]

{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015}} proposed a 14-step case formulation process that regards emotion-related problems as stemming from at least four different possible causes: lack of awareness or [[Experiential avoidance|avoidance of emotion]], dysregulation of emotion, maladaptive emotion response, or a problem with [[Meaning-making|making meaning]] of experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory features four types of emotion response (see {{section link||Emotion response types}} below), categorizes needs under "attachment" and "identity", specifies four types of emotional processing difficulties, delineates different types of empathy, has at least a dozen different ''task markers'' (see {{section link||Therapeutic tasks}} below), relies on two interactive tracks of emotion and narrative processes as sources of information about a client, and presumes a [[dialectical]]-[[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] model of [[psychological development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=8, 27, 50, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ''emotion schematic system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=3–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emotion schematic system is seen as the central catalyst of self-organization, often at the base of dysfunction and ultimately the road to cure. For simplicity, we use the term ''emotion schematic process'' to refer to the complex synthesis process in which a number of coactivated emotion schemes coapply, to produce a unified sense of self in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Techniques used in "coaching clients to work through their feelings"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; may include the [[Gestalt therapy]] empty chair technique, frequently used for resolving "unfinished business", and the two-chair technique, frequently used for self-critical splits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=219–241; 295–296}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion response types&lt;!--Section linked from [[Emotional reasoning]] and [[Emotions in decision-making]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;===
[[File:Girl with sad face.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sadness]]]]
[[File:Angry woman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anger]]]]
[[File:Portrait of Refugee, Paris 2009 A.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fear]]]]

Emotion-focused theorists have posited that each person's emotions are organized into idiosyncratic ''emotion [[Schema (psychology)|scheme]]s'' that are highly variable both between people and within the same person over time,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=117}}; {{harvnb|Thoma|McKay|2015|pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for practical purposes emotional responses can be classified into four broad types: ''primary adaptive'', ''primary maladaptive'', ''secondary reactive'', and ''instrumental''.&lt;ref name="Types"/&gt;

#'''Primary adaptive''' emotion responses are initial emotional responses to a given stimulus that have a clear beneficial value in the present situation—for example, [[sadness]] at loss, [[anger]] at violation, and [[fear]] at threat. Sadness is an adaptive response when it motivates people to reconnect with someone or something important that is missing. Anger is an adaptive response when it motivates people to take assertive action to end the violation. Fear is an adaptive response when it motivates people to avoid or escape an overwhelming threat. In addition to emotions that indicate action tendencies (such as the three just mentioned), primary adaptive emotion responses include the feeling of being certain and in control or uncertain and out of control, and/or a general felt sense of [[Psychological pain|emotional pain]]—these feelings and emotional pain do not provide immediate action tendencies but do provide adaptive information that can be symbolized and worked through in therapy. Primary adaptive emotion responses "are attended to and expressed in therapy in order to access the adaptive information and action tendency to guide problem solving."&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Primary maladaptive''' emotion responses are also initial emotional responses to a given stimulus; however, they are based on emotion schemes that are no longer useful (and that may or may not have been useful in the person's past) and that were often formed through previous traumatic experiences. Examples include sadness at the joy of others, anger at the genuine caring or concern of others, fear at harmless situations, and chronic feelings of insecurity/fear or worthlessness/[[shame]]. For example, a person may respond with anger at the genuine caring or concern of others because as a child he or she was offered caring or concern that was usually followed by a violation; as a result, he or she learned to respond to caring or concern with anger even when there is no violation. The person's angry response is understandable, and needs to be met with empathy and compassion even though his or her angry response is not helpful.&lt;ref name="Elliott 111"&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|2012|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary maladaptive emotion responses are accessed in therapy with the aim of transforming the emotion scheme through new experiences.&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg Paivio 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Secondary reactive''' emotion responses are complex chain reactions where a person reacts to his or her primary adaptive or maladaptive emotional response and then replaces it with another, secondary emotional response. In other words, they are emotional responses to prior emotional responses. ("Secondary" means that a different emotion response occurred first.) They can include secondary reactions of hopelessness, helplessness, rage, or despair that occur in response to primary emotion responses that are experienced (secondarily) as painful, uncontrollable, or violating. They may be escalations of a primary emotion response, as when people are angry about being angry, afraid of their fear, or sad about their sadness. They may be defenses against a primary emotion response, such as feeling anger to avoid sadness or fear to avoid anger; this can include [[gender role]]-stereotypical responses such as expressing anger when feeling primarily afraid (stereotypical of men's gender role), or expressing sadness when primarily angry (stereotypical of women's gender role).&lt;ref name="Greenberg Paivio 41"/&gt; "These are all complex, self-reflexive processes of reacting to one's emotions and transforming one emotion into another. Crying, for example, is not always true grieving that leads to relief, but rather can be the crying of secondary helplessness or frustration that results in feeling worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary reactive emotion responses are accessed and explored in therapy in order to increase awareness of them and to arrive at more primary and adaptive emotion responses.&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Instrumental''' emotion responses are experienced and expressed by a person because the person has learned that the response has an effect on others, "such as getting them to pay attention to us, to go along with something we want them to do for us, to approve of us, or perhaps most often just not to disapprove of us."&lt;ref name="Elliott 111"/&gt; Instrumental emotion responses can be consciously intended or unconsciously learned (i.e., through [[operant conditioning]]). Examples include [[crocodile tears]] (instrumental sadness), [[bullying]] (instrumental anger), [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf|crying wolf]] (instrumental fear), and feigned [[embarrassment]] (instrumental shame). When a client responds in therapy with instrumental emotion responses, it may feel manipulative or superficial to the therapist. Instrumental emotion responses are explored in therapy in order to increase awareness of their interpersonal function and/or the associated [[primary and secondary gain]].&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The therapeutic process with different emotion responses===
Emotion-focused theorists have proposed that each type of emotion response calls for a different intervention process by the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary adaptive emotion responses need be more fully allowed and accessed for their adaptive information. Primary maladaptive emotion responses need to be accessed and explored to help the client identify core unmet needs (e.g., for validation, safety, or connection), and then regulated and transformed with new experiences and new adaptive emotions. Secondary reactive emotion responses need [[empathic]] exploration in order to discover the sequence of emotions that preceded them. Instrumental emotion responses need to be explored interpersonally in the [[therapeutic relationship]] to increase awareness of them and address how they are functioning in the client's situation.

It is important to note that primary emotion responses are not called "primary" because they are somehow more real than the other responses; all of the responses feel real to a person, but therapists can classify them into these four types in order to help clarify the functions of the response in the client's situation and how to intervene appropriately.

===Therapeutic tasks===
A therapeutic task is an immediate problem that a client needs to resolve in a psychotherapy session. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers such as [[Laura North Rice]] (a former colleague of [[Carl Rogers]]) applied [[task analysis]] to transcripts of psychotherapy sessions in an attempt to describe in more detail the process of clients' cognitive and emotional change, so that therapists might more reliably provide optimal conditions for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|Greenberg|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of psychotherapy process research eventually led to a standardized (and evolving) set of therapeutic tasks in emotion-focused therapy for individuals.

The following table summarizes the standard set of these therapeutic tasks as of 2012.&lt;ref name="Elliott 118"&gt;Adapted from: {{harvnb|Elliott|2012|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tasks are classified into five broad groups: empathy-based, relational, experiencing, reprocessing, and action. The ''task marker'' is an observable sign that a client may be ready to work on the associated task. The ''intervention process'' is a sequence of actions carried out by therapist and client in working on the task. The ''end state'' is the desired resolution of the immediate problem.

In addition to the task markers listed below, other markers and intervention processes for working with emotion and narrative have been specified: ''same old stories'', ''empty stories'', ''unstoried emotions'', and ''broken stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angus|Greenberg|2011|pp=59–79}}; {{harvnb|Baljon|Pool|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion-focused therapy for trauma===
{{See also|Complex post traumatic stress disorder}}
The interventions and the structure of emotion-focused therapy have been adapted for the specific needs of [[psychological trauma]] survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fosha|Paivio|Gleiser|Ford|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manual of emotion-focused therapy for individuals with complex trauma (EFTT) has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paivio|Pascual-Leone|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modifications of the traditional Gestalt empty chair technique have been developed.

===Other versions of EFT for individuals===
{{harvtxt|Brubacher|2017}} proposed an emotionally focused approach to individual therapy that focuses on [[Attachment theory|attachment]], while integrating the experiential focus of empathic attunement for engaging and reprocessing emotional experience and tracking and restructuring the systemic aspects and patterns of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Attachment debate"&gt;The degree to which [[attachment theory]] adequately describes individual adult development and emotional symptom production has been debated among psychotherapists at least since 2010, when psychologist [[Jerome Kagan]] gave a talk questioning the importance of attachment relative to other factors; this debate has been called the "great attachment debate" ({{harvnb|Ecker|Ticic|Hulley|2012}}). For an [[Integrative psychotherapy|integrative]] explanation of various perspectives on the role of attachment theory in psychotherapy, see, for example: {{harvnb|Ecker|Ticic|Hulley|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist follows the attachment model by addressing deactivating and hyperactivating strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2009a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009b}}; {{harvnb|Brubacher|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual therapy is seen as a process of developing secure connections between therapist and client, between client and past and present relationships, and within the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubacher|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment principles guide therapy in the following ways: forming the collaborative therapeutic relationship, shaping the overall goal for therapy to be that of "effective dependency" (following [[John Bowlby]]) upon one or two safe others, [[wikt:depathologize|depathologizing]] emotion by [[wikt:normalize|normalizing]] separation distress responses, and shaping change processes.&lt;ref name="Emotionally focused"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Ruzgyte|Spinks|2011}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Brubacher|2016}}; {{harvnb|Brubacher|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change processes are: identifying and strengthening patterns of emotion regulation, and creating corrective emotional experiences to transform negative patterns into secure bonds.&lt;ref name="Emotionally focused"/&gt;

==Couples therapy==
[[File:Love is in the air... (389730795).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Couple (relationship)|couple]]]]

A [[Systemic therapy|systemic]] perspective is important in all approaches to EFT for couples. Tracking conflictual patterns of interaction, often referred to as a "dance" in Johnson's popular literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woolley|Faller|Palmer-Olsen|Vitoria|2016|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been a hallmark of the first stage of Johnson and Greenberg's approach since its inception in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1987}}; {{harvnb|Best|Johnson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Goldman and Greenberg's newer approach, therapists help clients "also work toward self-change and the resolution of pain stemming from unmet childhood needs that affect the couple interaction, in addition to working on interactional change."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman and Greenberg justify their added emphasis on self-change by noting that not all problems in a relationship can be solved only by tracking and changing patterns of interaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition, in our observations of psychotherapeutic work with couples, we have found that problems or difficulties that can be traced to core identity concerns such as needs for validation or a sense of worth are often best healed through therapeutic methods directed toward the self rather than to the interactions. For example, if a person's core emotion is one of shame and they feel "rotten at the core" or "simply fundamentally flawed," soothing or reassuring from one's partner, while helpful, will not ultimately solve the problem, lead to structural emotional change, or alter the view of oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Greenberg and Goldman's approach to EFT for couples, although they "fully endorse"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of attachment, attachment is not considered to be the only interpersonal motivation of couples; instead, attachment is considered to be one of three aspects of relational functioning, along with issues of identity/power and attraction/liking.&lt;ref name="Three dimensions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Attachment debate"/&gt; In Johnson's approach, attachment theory is considered to be the defining theory of adult love, subsuming other motivations, and it guides the therapist in processing and reprocessing emotion.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004, 2008, 2013, 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Greenman|Johnson|2013}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Brubacher|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greenberg and Goldman's approach, the emphasis is on working with core issues related to identity (working models of self and other) and promoting both self-soothing and other-soothing for a better relationship, in addition to interactional change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Johnson's approach, the primary goal is to reshape attachment bonds and create "effective dependency" (including secure attachment).&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004"/&gt;

===Stages and steps===
EFT for couples features a nine-step model of restructuring the attachment bond between partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the aim is to reshape the attachment bond and create more effective co-regulation and "effective dependency", increasing individuals' self-regulation and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Moser|Beckes|Smith|2013}}; cf. {{harvnb|Mikulincer|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In good-outcome cases, the couple is helped to respond and thereby meet each other's unmet needs and injuries from childhood. The newly shaped secure attachment bond may become the best antidote to traumatic experience from within and outside of the relationship.

Adding to the original three-stage, nine-step EFT framework developed by Johnson and Greenberg,&lt;ref name="Locus classicus"/&gt; Greenberg and Goldman's emotion-focused therapy for couples has five stages and 14 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|pp=137–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is structured to work on identity issues and self-regulation prior to changing negative interactions. It is considered necessary, in this approach, to help partners experience and reveal their own underlying vulnerable feelings first, so they are better equipped to do the intense work of attuning to the other partner and to be open to restructuring interactions and the attachment bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Johnson|2008}} summarizes the nine treatment steps in Johnson's model of EFT for couples: "The therapist leads the couple through these steps in a spiral fashion, as one step incorporates and leads into the other. In mildly distressed couples, partners usually work quickly through the steps at a parallel rate. In more distressed couples, the more passive or withdrawn partner is usually invited to go through the steps slightly ahead of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2008|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage 1. Stabilization (assessment and de-escalation phase)====
* Step 1: Identify the relational conflict issues between the partners
* Step 2: Identify the negative interaction cycle where these issues are expressed
* Step 3: Access attachment emotions underlying the position each partner takes in this cycle
* Step 4: Reframe the problem in terms of the cycle, unacknowledged emotions, and attachment needs

During this stage the therapist creates a comfortable and stable environment for the couple to have an open discussion about any hesitations the couples may have about the therapy, including the trustworthiness of the therapist. The therapist also gets a sense of the couple's positive and negative interactions from past and present and is able to summarize and present the negative patterns for them. Partners soon no longer view themselves as victims of their negative interaction cycle; they are now allies against it.

====Stage 2. Restructuring the bond (changing interactional positions phase)====
* Step 5: Access disowned or implicit needs (e.g., need for reassurance), emotions (e.g., shame), and models of self
* Step 6: Promote each partner's acceptance of the other's experience
* Step 7: Facilitate each partner's expression of needs and wants to restructure the interaction based on new understandings and create bonding events

This stage involves restructuring and widening the emotional experiences of the couple. This is done through couples recognizing their attachment needs, and then changing their interactions based on those needs. At first their new way of interacting may be strange and hard to accept, but as they become more aware and in control of their interactions they are able to stop old patterns of behavior from reemerging.

====Stage 3. Integration and consolidation====
* Step 8: Facilitate the formulation of new stories and new solutions to old problems
* Step 9: Consolidate new cycles of behavior

This stage focuses on reflection of new emotional experiences and self-concepts. It integrates the couple's new ways of dealing with problems within themselves and in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2008|pp=116–117}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles of attachment===
{{harvtxt|Johnson|Sims|2000}} described four attachment styles that affect the therapy process:
# People who are secure and trusting perceive themselves as lovable, able to trust others and themselves within a relationship. They give clear emotional signals, and are engaged, resourceful and flexible in unclear relationships. Secure partners express feelings, articulate needs, and allow their own vulnerability to show.
# People who have a diminished ability to articulate feelings, tend not to acknowledge their need for attachment, and struggle to name their needs in a relationship. They tend to adopt a safe position and solve problems dispassionately without understanding the effect that their safe distance has on their partners.
# People who are psychologically reactive and who exhibit anxious attachment. They tend to demand reassurance in an aggressive way, demand their partner's attachment and tend to use [[blame]] strategies (including [[emotional blackmail]]) in order to engage their partner.
# People who have been traumatized and have experienced little to no recovery from it vacillate between attachment and hostility.

==Family therapy==
[[File:Gen Halilintar.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[family]]]]

The emotionally focused family therapy (EFFT) of Johnson and her colleagues aims to promote secure bonds among distressed family members.&lt;ref&gt;Early publications on EFFT include: {{harvnb|Johnson|Maddeaux|Blouin|1998}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Lee|2000}}; {{harvnb|Palmer|Efron|2007}}. A key text for emotionally focused therapy includes a chapter on EFFT titled "Emotionally focused family therapy: restructuring attachment" ({{harvnb|Johnson|2004|pp=243–266}}).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a therapy approach consistent with the attachment-oriented experiential–systemic emotionally focused model&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004, 2008, 2013, 2016"/&gt; in three stages: (1) de-escalating negative cycles of interaction that amplify conflict and insecure connections between parents and children; (2) restructuring interactions to shape positive cycles of parental accessibility and responsiveness to offer the child or adolescent a safe haven and a secure base; (3) consolidation of the new responsive cycles and secure bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brassard|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary focus is on strengthening parental responsiveness and caregiving, to meet children and adolescents' attachment needs.&lt;ref name="Palmer 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|2015|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to "build stronger families through (1) recruiting and strengthening parental emotional responsiveness to children, (2) accessing and clarifying children's attachment needs, and (3) facilitating and shaping caregiving interactions from parent to child".&lt;ref name="Palmer 2015"/&gt; Some clinicians have integrated EFFT with play therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirschfeld|Wittenborn|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of clinicians, inspired in part by Greenberg's approach to EFT, developed a treatment protocol specifically for families of individuals struggling with an eating disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Greenberg|2015}}; {{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Stillar|Henderson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment is based on the principles and techniques of four different approaches: emotion-focused therapy, behavioral family therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and the New Maudsley family skills-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Greenberg|2015|pp=75–76}}; {{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Stillar|Henderson|2016|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to help parents "support their child in the processing of emotions, increasing their emotional self-efficacy, deepening the parent–child relationships and thereby making ED [eating disorder] symptoms unnecessary to cope with painful emotional experiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Greenberg|2015|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment has three main domains of intervention, four core principles, and five steps derived from Greenberg's emotion-focused approach and influenced by [[John Gottman]]: (1) attending to the child's emotional experience, (2) naming the emotions, (3) validating the emotional experience, (4) meeting the emotional need, and (5) helping the child to move through the emotional experience, problem solving if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Stillar|Henderson|2016|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
Johnson, Greenberg, and many of their colleagues have spent their long careers as academic researchers publishing the results of empirical studies of various forms of EFT.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the literature reviews in: {{harvnb|Elliott|Greenberg|Watson|Timulak|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wiebe|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]] considers emotion-focused therapy for individuals to be an empirically supported treatment for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|APA|2013}}; {{harvnb|Lebow|2008|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Wedding|Corsini|2013|pp=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have suggested that it is effective in the treatment of depression, interpersonal problems, trauma, and avoidant personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Paivio|Nieuwenhuis|2001}}; {{harvnb|Watson|Gordon|Stermac|Kalogerakos|2003}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Watson|2005}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|Angus|2006}}; {{harvnb|Paivio|Pascual-Leone|2010}}; {{harvnb|Pascual-Leone|Bierman|Arnold|Stasiak|2011}}; {{harvnb|Pos|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of EFT have claimed that studies have consistently shown clinically significant improvement post therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiebe|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies, again mostly by EFT practitioners, have suggested that emotionally focused therapy for couples is an effective way to restructure distressed couple relationships into safe and secure bonds with long-lasting results.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|Hunsley|Greenberg|Schindler|1999}}; {{harvnb|Dessaulles|Johnson|Denton|2003}}; {{harvnb|Najafi|Soleimani|Ahmadi|Javidi|2015}}; {{harvnb|Wiebe|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Johnson|Hunsley|Greenberg|Schindler|1999}} conducted a meta-analysis of the four most rigorous outcome studies before 2000 and concluded that the original nine-step, three-stage emotionally focused therapy approach to couples therapy&lt;ref name="Locus classicus"/&gt; had a larger effect size than any other couple intervention had achieved to date, but this meta-analysis was later harshly criticized by psychologist [[James C. Coyne]], who called it "a poor quality meta-analysis of what should have been left as pilot studies conducted by promoters of a therapy in their own lab".&lt;ref name="Coyne 2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Coyne|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study with an [[fMRI]] component suggested that emotionally focused couples therapy reduces the brain's response to threat in the presence of a romantic partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Moser|Beckes|Smith|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this study too was later harshly criticized by Coyne.&lt;ref name="Coyne 2014"/&gt;

==Strengths==
Some of the strengths of EFT approaches can be summarized as follows:
# EFT aims to be collaborative and respectful of clients, combining experiential [[person-centered therapy]] techniques with [[systemic therapy]] interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=7–14}}; {{harvnb|Furrow|Johnson|Bradley|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Change strategies and interventions are specified through intensive analysis of psychotherapy process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|Greenberg|1984}}; {{harvnb|Pascual-Leone|Greenberg|Pascual-Leone|2009}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# EFT has been validated by 30 years of empirical research. There is also research on the change processes and predictors of success.&lt;ref name="Greenberg 2011, Elliott et al. 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Greenberg|Watson|Timulak|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# EFT has been applied to different kinds of problems and populations, although more research on different populations and cultural adaptations is needed.&lt;ref name="Greenberg 2011, Elliott et al. 2013" /&gt;
# EFT for couples is based on conceptualizations of marital distress and adult love that are supported by empirical research on the nature of adult interpersonal attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Ruzgyte|Spinks|2011}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Psychotherapist Campbell Purton, in his 2014 book ''The Trouble with Psychotherapy'', criticized a variety of approaches to psychotherapy, including [[behavior therapy]], [[person-centered therapy]], [[psychodynamic therapy]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], emotion-focused therapy, and [[existential therapy]]; he argued that these psychotherapies have accumulated excessive and/or flawed theoretical baggage that deviates too much from an everyday common-sense understanding of personal troubles.&lt;ref name="Purton"&gt;{{harvnb|Purton|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to emotion-focused therapy, Purton argued that "the effectiveness of each of the 'therapeutic tasks' can be understood without the theory"&lt;ref name="Purton"/&gt;{{rp|124}} and that what clients say "is not well explained in terms of the interaction of emotion schemes; it is better explained in terms of the person's situation, their response to it, and their having learned the particular language in which they articulate their response."&lt;ref name="Purton"/&gt;{{rp|129}}

In 2014, psychologist [[James C. Coyne]] criticized some EFT research for lack of rigor (for example, being [[Power (statistics)|underpowered]] and having [[Observer-expectancy effect|high risk of bias]]), but he also noted that such problems are common in the field of psychotherapy research.&lt;ref name="Coyne 2014"/&gt;

In a 2015 article in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' on "[[memory reconsolidation]], emotional arousal and the process of change in psychotherapy", Richard D. Lane and colleagues summarized a common claim in the literature on emotion-focused therapy that "emotional arousal is a key ingredient in therapeutic change" and that "emotional arousal is critical to psychotherapeutic success".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015|pp=1, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a response accompanying the article, Bruce Ecker and colleagues (creators of [[coherence therapy]]) disagreed with this claim and argued that the key ingredient in therapeutic change involving memory reconsolidation is not emotional arousal but instead a perceived mismatch between an expected pattern and an experienced pattern; they wrote:&lt;ref name="Ecker et al. 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|Hulley|Ticic|2015}}; see also {{harvnb|Patihis|2015}} for a similar criticism from a [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The brain clearly does not require emotional arousal per se for inducing [[Memory deconsolidation|deconsolidation]]. That is a fundamental point. If the target [[learning]] happens to be emotional, then its reactivation (the first of the two required elements) of course entails an experience of that emotion, but the emotion itself does not inherently play a role in the mismatch that then deconsolidates the target learning, or in the new learning that then rewrites and erases the target learning (discussed at greater length in {{harvnb|Ecker|2015}}). [...] The same considerations imply that "changing emotion with emotion" (stated three times by Lane et al.) inaccurately characterizes how learned responses change through [[Memory reconsolidation|reconsolidation]]. Mismatch consists most fundamentally of a direct, unmistakable perception that the world functions differently from one's learned model. "Changing model with mismatch" is the core phenomenology.&lt;ref name="Ecker et al. 2015"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other responses to {{harvtxt|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015}} argued that their emotion-focused approach "would be strengthened by the inclusion of predictions regarding additional factors that might influence treatment response, predictions for improving outcomes for non-responsive patients, and a discussion of how the proposed model might explain individual differences in vulnerability for mental health problems",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimbrel|Meyer|Beckham|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that their model needed further development to account for the diversity of states called "[[psychopathology]]" and the relevant maintaining and worsening processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mancini|Gangemi|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5168">The '''end-of-history illusion''' is a psychological [[illusion]] in which individuals of all ages believe that they have experienced significant [[personal growth]] and changes in [[Taste (sociology)|tastes]] up to the present moment, but will not substantially [[Developmental psychology|grow or mature]] in the future.&lt;ref name="Quoidbach2013" /&gt;  Despite recognizing that their perceptions have evolved, individuals predict that their perceptions will remain roughly the same in the future.

The illusion is based on the fact that at any given developmental stage, an individual can observe a relatively low level of maturity in previous stages. The phenomenon affects teenagers, middle-aged individuals, and seniors. In general, people tend to see significant changes in hindsight, but fail to predict that these changes will continue. For example, a 20-year-old's impression of how great a change they will undergo in the next ten years will not be as extreme as a 30-year-old's recollection of the changes they underwent between the ages of 20 and 30. The same phenomenon is true for people of any age.&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt; The reason for the illusion has not been studied, although researchers speculate that a resistance or fear of change may be causal.&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] gave a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk about the illusion.&lt;ref name="GilbertTED" /&gt; Gilbert speculates that the phenomenon may occur because of the difficulty of predicting how one will change or a satisfaction with one's current state of being.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2015"/&gt; Gilbert also relates the phenomenon to the way humans perceive time in general.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2015"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The original study that suggested the end-of-history illusion, which was led by Jordi Quoidbach, has been met with criticism for its use of a [[cross-sectional study]] rather than a [[longitudinal study]], which would have lent itself better to the long-term nature of the effect. Critics are also skeptical of the reliability of [[autobiographical memory]].&lt;ref name="Poulsen2013"/&gt;

'''Envipco''' ("Environmental Products Corporation") is a global recycling company.  Envipco's corporate headquarters are located in [[Naugatuck, Connecticut]]. &lt;br /&gt;
Envipco USA is an [[United States|American]] manufacturer and distributor of [[reverse vending machines]] and other reverse vending solutions for all size clients - from convenience stores to Redemption Centers and everything in between.

==Company Products==

===Reverse Vending Machines===
Envipco products include [[Reverse vending machine]]s and customized [[solution]]s for its clients. Reverse vending machines (RVMs) collect, compact and sort customers' empty beverage containers and, where applicable, issue a voucher redeemable for cash. The Envipco RVMs can also have interactive advertising, couponing and integration with Retailer POS.&lt;br /&gt;
Envipco's reverse vending machines differ based on the market in which they appear.  In deposit-and-return markets, the reverse vending machines use bar code and/or camera technology to identify the product being recycled.  In non-deposit markets the reverse vending machines identify the product as being [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] or [[aluminum recycling|aluminum]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, Brian 2011"&gt;Taylor, Brian."Reverse Angle"."Recycling Today", March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the United States, Envipco machines are most common in the 10 states that require [[Container deposit legislation in the United States|bottle deposits]]. Envipco's products can be found around the globe in both deposit and non-deposit markets - including USA, Canada, the UK, France, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Australia and Japan. 
Envipco's current flagship product is the Quantum bulk-feed reverse vending machine.  The Quantum is the first successful bulk-feed RVM in the industry - a quantum leap in the consumer experience, allowing emptying of entire bags of containers into the machine (no feeding one container at a time). It is the most efficient return of containers in quantities processing over 100 cans and plastic bottles/ minute.
The Ultra 48 and HDS product lines are ADA compliant and the mainstay for high volume, single-feed RVMs in the Deposit Market generating a cash voucher for a refund of the deposit paid on the container. 
For smaller shops and stores, the Flex product is the right model.  It is the smallest footprint RVM in Envipco's product portfolio with the lowest price tag.  This RVM is best suited for convenience stores, pharmacies, gas stations and other venues where container returns are typically low volume.
In states that do not have bottle deposits, as well as outside of the United States, reverse vending machines can generate coupons, prizes or vouchers for donations to schools.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Brian 2011"/&gt;

===Recycling Centers===
Envipco's products are also featured in Recycling Centers.  The Quantum Outdoor RVM itself can be installed in less than 3 standard parking spaces.  It allows storage of approximately 60,000 containers before it needs to be emptied.  Envipco's Ultra 48 and Ultra HDS are also featured in outdoor kiosks - especially prolific in the Greek (non-deposit) and Australian (deposit) markets.

'''Escape and radiate coevolution''' is a multistep process that hypothesizes that an organism under constraints from other organisms will develop new defenses, allowing it to "escape" and then "radiate" into differing species. After a novel defense has been acquired, an organism is able to escape predation and rapidly multiply into new species because of relaxed selective pressure. There are many possible mechanisms available varying between different types of organisms, however they must be novel in order for escape to allow for radiation. This theory applies to predator-prey associations, but is most often applied to plant-herbivore associations.

This form of [[coevolution]] can be complex but is essential to understanding the vast biological diversity among organisms today. Out of the many forms of coevolution, escape and radiate is most likely responsible for providing the most diversity. This is due to the nature of the "evolutionary arms race" and the continuous cycle of counter adaptations. It is a relatively new field of study and is rapidly gaining credibility. To date, there has not been a formal study published specifically for escape and radiate coevolution.

== Origin of Theory ==

This theory originated in a paper by Ehrlich and Raven, 1964, "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution".&lt;ref name=EhrlichRaven1964/&gt; It outlined and laid the foundations of the concept. However, the term "escape and radiate" was not coined until Thompson's 1989 "Concepts of Coevolution".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The theory has not yet been fully analyzed, however, as since its origins it has grown in importance among evolutionary biologists and botanists.

== Escape ==

In order for an organism to "escape", and then radiate into varying species it needs a mechanism to escape. These defense mechanisms vary widely and differ for different types of organisms. Plants use chemical defenses in the form of secondary metabolites or [[allelochemicals]]. These allelochemicals inhibit the growth, behavior, and health of herbivores, allowing plants to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, Terry. "Allelochemicals in plants." Allelopathy in Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry. Springer New York, 2008. 63-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a plant allelochemical are alkaloids that can inhibit protein synthesis in herbivores. Other forms of plant defense include mechanical defenses such as [[Thigmonastic movements|thigmonasty movements]] which have the plant leaves close in response to tactile stimulation. Indirect mechanisms plant include shedding of plant leaves so less leaves are available which deters herbivores, growth in locations in that are difficult to reach, and even mimicry. For organisms other than plants, examples of defense mechanisms allowing for escape include camouflage, [[aposematism]],&lt;ref&gt;Mappes, Johanna, Nicola Marples, and John A. Endler. "The complex business of survival by aposematism." Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20.11 (2005): 598-603.&lt;/ref&gt; heightened senses and physical capabilities, and even defensive behaviors such as feigning death. An example of an organism using one of these defense mechanisms is the [[granular poison frog]] which defends itself through aposematism. It is important to understand that in order for escape and radiate coevolution to occur, it is necessary that the developed defense is novel rather than previously established.

Induced defense stemming from adaptive [[phenotypic plasticity]] may help a plant defend itself against multiple enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Anurag A. "Induced plant defense: evolution of induction and adaptive phenotypic plasticity." Inducible plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores: biochemistry, ecology, and agriculture. American Phytopathological Society Press, St. Paul, MN (1999): 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenotypic plasticity occurs when an organism undergoes an environmental change forcing a change altering its behavior, physiology, etc. These induced defenses allow for an organism to escape.

== Radiate ==

Radiation is the evolutionary process of diversification of a single species into multiple forms. It includes the physiological and ecological diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Schluter, Dolph. The ecology of adaptive radiation. Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of radiation including adaptive, concordant, and discordant radiation however escape and radiate coevolution does not always follow those specific types.

This eventually leads to the question, why does escape allow for radiation?  Once a novel defense has been acquired, the attacking organism which had evolved adaptations that allowed it to predate is now up against a new defense that it has not yet been evolved to encounter. This gives the defending organism the advantage, and therefore time to rapidly multiply unopposed by the previously attacking organism. This ultimately leads to the physiological and ecological diversity within the rapidly multiplying lineage, hence radiation.

== Importance ==

A full study analyzing the effects of escape and radiate coevolution has not yet been completed which hinders knowing how applicable this form of coevolution could be to other areas of study, or global concerns, only hypotheses of its effects can be made. Improved agriculture, conservation, biological diversity, and epidemiology are just some of the areas that could potentially be helped through the study of coevolution and its specific hypotheses such as escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "The raw material for coevolution." Oikos (1999): 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
A theory as to why we see such vast biological diversity today may be because of escape and radiate coevolution. After the organism escapes, it then radiates into multiple species, and spreads geographically. Evidence of escape and radiate coevolution can be seen through the starburst effect in plant and herbivore [[clades]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "Coevolution: the geographic mosaic of coevolutionary arms races." Current Biology 15.24 (2005): R992-R994.&lt;/ref&gt; When analyzing clades of predator-prey associations, although it varies, the starburst effect is a good indicator that escape and radiate coevolution may be occurring. Eventually this cycle must come to an end because adaptations that  entail costs (allocation of resources, vulnerability to other predators) that at some point outweigh their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;"Coevolution." Interactions Among Species. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Nov. 1993. &lt;http://neko.bio.utk.edu/~ijuric/EEB460_&lt;/ref&gt;
Escape and radiate coevolution may support parallel [[cladogenesis]], wherein plant and herbivore [[phylogenies]] might match with ancestral insects exploiting ancestral plants. This is significant because it allows researchers to hypothesize about the relationships between ancestral organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Insect Ecology: Behavior, Populations and Communities By R. F. Denno, M. D. Eubanks&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, there have not yet been any known examples specifically involving escape and radiate coevolution being used for hypothesizing ancestral relationships.

Many times the organism that has "escaped" continuously undergoes selective pressure because the predator it has escaped from evolves to create another adaptation in response, causing the process to continue. These "offensive" traits developed by predators range widely. For example, herbivores can develop an adaptation that allows for improved detoxification which allow to overcome plant defenses, thus causing escape and radiate coevolution to continue. Often the term "evolutionary arms race" is used to illustrate the idea that continuous evolution is needed to maintain the same relative fitness while the two species are coevolving. This idea also ties in with the [[Red Queen hypothesis]]. Counter adaptations among two organisms through escape and radiate coevolution is a major driving force behind diversity.

Escape and radiate coevolution produces much more biological variation than other evolutionary mechanisms. For instance, cospeciation is important for diversity amongst species that share a symbiotic relationship, however this does not create nearly as much diversity in comparison to reciprocal evolutionary change due to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "Coevolution." eLS (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence of rapid diversification following a novel adaptation is shown through the evolution of resin and latex canal tubes in 16 different lineages of plants. Plants with resin or latex canals can easily defend themselves against insect herbivores. When lineages of canal bearing plants are compared to the lineages of canal free plants, it is apparent that canal bearing plants are far more diverse, supporting escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Brian D., David E. Dussourd, and Charles Mitter. "Escalation of plant defense: do latex and resin canals spur plant diversification?." American Naturalist (1991): 881-900.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==

=== Plant-herbivore ===
[[File:Monarch In May.jpg|592 KBpx|thumb|right|Erlich and Raven's Classic butterfly model]]

The most popular examples of escape and radiate coevolution are of plant-herbivore associations. The most classic example is of butterflies and plants outlined in Ehrlich and Raven's original paper, "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution.". Erlich and Raven found in 1964 that hostplants for butterflies had a wide range of chemical defenses, allowing them to escape herbivory. Butterflies who developed novel counter detoxification mechanisms against the hostplants chemical defenses were able to utilize the hostplant resources.&lt;ref name=EhrlichRaven1964&gt;Ehrlich, P. R., &amp; Raven, P. H. (1964). Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution. Evolution, 586-608.&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of stepwise adaptation and counteradaptation among the butterflies and hostplants is continuous and creates vast diversity.

Tropical trees may also escape and defend themselves. Trees growing in high light were predicted to have few chemical defenses, but rapid synchronous leaf expansion and low leaf nutritional quality during expansion. Species growing in low light have high levels of different chemical defenses, poor nutritional quality and asynchronous leaf expansion. Depending on the level of light the trees were growing in influenced the type of defenses they obtained, either chemical or through leaf expansion. The trees exposed to less light developed various chemicals to defend themselves against herbivores, a defense not utilizing light. This study was significant because it illustrates the separation between defenses and their relationship with an organism escaping and radiating into other species. Development of novel defenses does not necessarily imply that escape is possible for a species of plant if herbivores are adapting at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;Kursar, Thomas A., and Phyllis D. Coley. "Convergence in defense syndromes of young leaves in tropical rainforests." Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 31.8 (2003): 929-949.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asclepiascommon.JPG|thumb|[[Common milkweed]] plant bears [[latex]] tubes to ward off herbivores.]]

Milkweed plants contain [[latex]]-filled canals which deter insect herbivores. Latex is toxic for small herbivores because it disrupts sodium and potassium levels. This has allowed for milkweeds to "escape" and become extremely diverse. There are over 100 different species of milkweeds which shows how diverse the plant is, with escape and radiate coevolution playing a very large role in creating such a high number of species.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Anurag A. "Natural selection on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) by a community of specialized insect herbivores." Evolutionary Ecology Research 7.5 (2005): 651.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish-water flea ===

Key adaptations are adaptations that allow a group of organisms to diversify. ''Daphnia lumholtzi'' is a water flea that is able to form rigid head spines in response to chemicals released when fish are present. These phenotypically plastic traits serve as an induced defense against these predators. A study showed that ''Daphnia pulicaria'' is competitively superior to ''D. lumholtzi'' in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defenses and became the dominant water flea in the region. This switch in dominance suggests that the induced defense against fish predation could represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of ''D. lumholtzi''. A defensive trait that qualifies as a key adaptation is most likely an example of escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Katharina, and Ralph Tollrian. "Inducible defences as key adaptations for the successful invasion of Daphnia lumholtzi in North America?." Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 276.1663 (2009): 1865-1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacteria-phage ===

The theory can be applied at the microscopic level such as to [[bacteria]]-[[phage]] relationships. Bacteria were able to diversify and escape through resistance to phages. The diversity among the hosts and parasites differed among the range of infection and resistance. The implication of this study to humans is its important to understanding the evolution of infectious organisms, and preventing diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Best, A., et al. "The Evolution of Host‐Parasite Range." The American naturalist 176.1 (2010): 63-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Property law}}

A '''gift''', in the [[law]] of [[property]], is the voluntary transfer of property from one person (the [[donor]] or grantor) to another (the donee or grantee) without full valuable [[consideration]]. In order for a [[gift]] to be legally effective, three requirements must be met:
# Intention of donor to give the gift to the donee (''donative intent'')
# Delivery of gift to donee.
# Acceptance of gift by donee.

==Elements==
===Intention===
{{Original research|section|date=June 2012|reson=unless referenced}}
The donor of the gift must have a present intent to make a gift of the property to the donee. A promise to make a gift in the future is unenforceable, and legally meaningless, even if the promise is accompanied by a present transfer of the physical property in question.

Suppose, for example, that a man gives a woman a ring and tells her that it is for her next birthday and to hold on to it until then. The man has not made a gift, and could legally demand the ring back at any time before the woman's birthday. In contrast, suppose a man gives a woman a deed and tells her it will be in her best interest if the deed stays in his safe-deposit box. The man has made a gift and would be unable to legally reclaim it.

===Delivery===
The gift must be delivered to the donee.&lt;ref&gt;For effective delivery of gift in Australia see: {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|78|1995|litigants=Horsley v Phillips Fine Art Auctioneers Pty Ltd |date=16 October 1995 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the gift is of a type that cannot be delivered in the conventional sense - a house, or a bank account - the delivery can be effected by a ''constructive delivery'', wherein a tangible item allowing access to the gift - a [[deed]] or [[key (lock)|key]] to the house, a passbook for the bank account - is delivered instead. ''Symbolic delivery'' is also sometimes permissible where manual delivery is impractical, such as the delivery of a key that does not open anything, but is intended to symbolize the transfer of ownership.

Certain forms of property must be transferred following particular formalities described by statute law. In [[England]], [[real property]] must be transferred by a written deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1925 |chapter=20 |act=Law of Property Act}} s.52&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of [[equitable interest]]s must be performed in writing by the owner or their agent.

A gift is assumed when property owner deeds real estate as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Regardless of contribution to purchase price, such a deed guaranteees each tenant equal shares upon sale or partition of the property.

===Acceptance===
The donee must accept the gift in order for the property transfer to take place. However, because people generally accept gifts, acceptance will be presumed, so long as the donee does not expressly reject the gift. A rejection of the gift destroys the gift, so that a donee cannot revive a once-rejected gift by later accepting it. In order for such an acceptance to be effective, the donor would have to extend the offer of the gift again.

==Types==
Gifts can be either:

===''inter vivos''===
* lifetime gifts (''inter vivos'' gift, ''donatio inter vivos'') - a gift of a present or future interest made and delivered in the donor's lifetime; or

===''causa mortis''===

* deathbed gifts (gift ''causa mortis'', ''donatio mortis causa'') - a future gift made in expectation of the donor's imminent death. A gift ''causa mortis'' is not effective unless the donor dies of the impending peril that he or she had contemplated when making the gift, i.e. these gifts can only be made when the donor is in a terminal condition.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Donatio Mortis Causa |volume=8 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts can also be:
===outright===
* outright - made free of any restrictions, such as being subject to a trust;
===onerous===
* onerous - made with a burden or obligation imposed on the donee; or
===remunerative===
* remunerative - made to compensate for services rendered

==Revocation==
Conditional gifts can be revoked based on (1) donee not fulfilling the conditions (2) breach of contract by donor such as an engagement ring and in this case, the donee keeps the gift.
{{Empty section|date=August 2012}}

==Taxation==

=== In India===
In India, previously there was Gift Tax Act under which donor had to pay the gift tax on the amount of gift. However, the said Act has been abolished and from FY 2004-05, a new provision was inserted in the Income Tax Act (1961) under section 56 (2) which provides that if the gift is received by an individual or Hindu undivided family from any relatives or blood relatives or at the time of marriage or as inheritance or in contemplation of death, it will not be taxable. In all other cases if the aggregagte of gifts received exceeds Rs 50,000 in a year, the gift will be taxable as income from other source.

===United Kingdom===
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
Gifts into a trust above a certain value (known as the nil rate band which is currently £325,000 but this limit may be reduced by certain gifts made in the last 7 years) are generally subject to inheritance tax in the United Kingdom though at the reduced rate of inheritance tax of 20% rather than the full rate of 40%.  There are certain reliefs that may apply to reduce or eliminate the IHT due including [[business property relief]] and [[agricultural property relief]]. Gifts to individuals are generally not subject to inheritance tax unless the donor dies within 7 years of the date of the gift.  There is anti-avoidance legislation to prevent assets being gifted but with the donor retaining a benefit from the asset (for example the gift of the main residence while continuing to live in it will be ineffective from an IHT perspective unless market value rent is charged). Gifts in life may be a way to circumvent [[inheritance tax]] on death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18852">The '''Global Terrorism Index''' ('''GTI''') is a report published annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace|Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)]], and was developed by IT entrepreneur and IEP's founder [[Steve Killelea]].

The index provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism since 2000. It produces a composite score in order to provide an ordinal ranking of countries on the impact of terrorism.

It is an attempt to systematically rank the nations of the world according to [[Terrorism|terrorist]] activity. The index combines a number of factors associated with terrorist attacks to build an explicit picture of the impact of terrorism, illustrating trends, and providing a data series for analysis by researchers and policymakers.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database]] (GTD) which is collected and collated by the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START) at the [[University of Maryland]]. The GTD has codified over 150,000 cases of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the GTI|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/terrorismindex/about-the-gti/|accessdate=11 February 2013|page=Vision of Humanity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211055153/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/terrorismindex/about-the-gti/|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTI covers 163 countries, covering 99.7% of the world's population.

The aim of the report is to examine trends and to help inform a positive and practical debate about the future of terrorism and the required policy responses.

The GTI was developed in consultation with the [[Global Peace Index]] expert panel.

== Methodology ==
There is no single internationally accepted definition of what constitutes terrorism, IEP accepts the terminology and definitions agreed to by the authors of the GTD, the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)]] researchers and its advisory panel. The GTI therefore defines terrorism as “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/|title=Data Collection Methodology|website=www.start.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition recognises that terrorism is not only the physical act of an attack, but also the psychological impact it has on a society for many years after.

In order to be included as an incident in the GTD the act has to be: “an intentional act of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor". This means an incident has to meet three criteria in order for it to be counted as a terrorist act:

# The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator. 
# The incident must entail some level of violence or threat of violence — including property damage, as well as violence against people. 
# The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. This database does not include acts of state terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===GTI scoring system===

The GTI score for a country in a given year is based on a unique scoring system to account for the relative impact of incidents in the year. There are four factors counted in each country's yearly score:

* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of terrorist incidents in a given year]]
* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism in a given year]]
* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of injuries caused by terrorism in a given year]]
* The approximate level of total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year

Each of the factors is weighted differently and a five-year weighted average is applied to importantly reflect the lingering psychological effect of terrorist acts over time. The weightings shown in the table below were determined by consultation with the GPI Expert Panel:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Weight
|-
| Total number of incidents || 1
|-
| Total number of fatalities || 3
|-
| Total number of injuries || 0.5
|-
| Sum of property damages measure || 2
|}

The greatest weighting is attributed to a fatality. The property damage measure is further disaggregated into four bands depending on the measured scope of the property damage inflicted by one incident. These bandings are shown in the table below, whereby incidents causing less than US$1 million are accorded a weight of 1, between $1 million and $1 billion, and more than $1 billion. A great majority of incidents are coded in the GTD as an 'unknown' level of property damage, thus scoring nil, with 'catastrophic' events being extremely rare.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Damage level
|-
| 0 || Unknown
|-
| 1 || Minor (likely &lt; $1 million)
|-
| 2 || Major (likely between $1 million and $1 billion)
|-
| 3 || Catastrophic (likely &gt; $1 billion)
|-
|}

===Example of a country's GTI score===

To assign a relative number to how a country has been directly impacted by terrorism in any given year, for every incident recorded, the GTI calculates a weighted sum of all indicators. To illustrate, the table below depicts a hypothetical country's score for a given year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Weight !! # of records for the given year !! Score
|-
| Total number of incidents || 1 || 21 || 21
|-
| Total number of fatalities || 3 || 36 || 108
|-
| Total number of injuries || 0.5 || 53 || 26.5
|-
| Sum of property damages measure (depending on severity) || 0-3 || 20 || 40
|-
| '''Total raw score''' || colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | '''195.5'''

==Economic impact of terrorism==
The economic impact of terrorism is calculated using IEP's cost of violence methodology.

The model includes both the direct and indirect costs, such as the lost life-time earnings, cost of medical treatments and property destruction from incidents of terrorism. The direct costs include those borne by the victim of the terrorist act and associated expenditure, such as medical spending. The indirect costs include lost productivity and earning as well as the psychological trauma to the victims, their families and friends.

The analysis presents conservative estimates of the economic impact of terrorism and does not include variables for which detailed appropriate data was not available. For instance, the analysis does not include the impact on business, the cost of fear from terrorism or the cost of counterterrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-terrorism-index-2016|title=Global Terrorism Index 2016|date=2016-11-17|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2017-07-13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of terrorism reached US$89.6 billion in 2015, decreasing by 15 per cent from its 2014 level.

There have been three peaks in the economic impact of terrorism since the year 2000 and they are linked to the three major waves of terrorism. The first large increase in the economic impact of terrorism happened in 2001, when the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] took place. The second peak was in 2007 at the height of the Iraq war. The 2007 increase is mainly attributed to al-Qa'ida affiliated terrorist groups and coincided with the coalition troop surge in Iraq. The third wave started in 2012 and is still continuing, with the economic impact of terrorism peaking at US$105.6 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/what-is-the-economic-impact-of-terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the last four years was mainly driven by increases in terrorism in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===
The first edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in 2012. The study covered analysis of 158 countries. Data showed that terrorism increased by 234 per cent from 2002 to 2011.

The 2012 report found that the global impact of terrorism increased significantly from 2002 to 2007, reaching its peak in 2007, and subsequently plateauing. The biggest rise took place over the period from 2005 to 2007 when the majority of the global increase in terrorism was driven by events in Iraq. Four other countries also significantly contributed to the global rise with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Philippines all experiencing increases, especially between 2007 and 2009.

Only 20 nations scored a zero for terrorist impact over the 2002-2011 period, indicating the impact of terror, while heavily concentrated in some places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, was widely distributed around the world.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2011 were, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Yemen. Including these countries, the top ten countries affected by terrorism accounted for 87 per cent of total global incidents.

===2014===
The second edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2014. The study covered analysis of 162 countries. From 2000 to 2013 there was a five-fold increase in the number of people killed by terrorism, resulting in approximately 18,000 deaths.

Of the 162 countries, 87 experienced a terrorist incident, but only 60 countries recorded one or more deaths from terrorism in 2013. Worldwide over 50 per cent of terrorist attacks claimed no fatalities and only 10 per cent claimed more than five lives. Explosives were used for 60 per cent of attacks, with firearms used in 30 per cent and 10 per cent of attacks using other weapons.

In 2013 terrorist activity increased substantially with the total number of deaths rising from 11,133 in 2012 to 17,958 in 2013, a 61 per cent increase. Over the same period, the number of countries that experienced more than 50 deaths rose from 15 to 24. This highlighted that not only was the intensity of terrorism increasing, its breadth was increasing as well.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2013 were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Four terrorist groups, ISIL, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qa'ida, claimed 66 per cent of deaths in 2013. Among OECD countries, Turkey and Mexico reported the highest deaths in 2013 losing 57 and 40 lives respectively. Since 2000, seven per cent of all terrorist incidents occurred in OECD countries.

===2015===
[[File:Global Terrorism Index 2015 by country.svg|thumb|A world map indicating the GTI by country (based on 2015 data)]]

The third edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2015. The study covered analysis of 162 countries. Data from 2014 showed there has been a nine-fold increase in the number of deaths from terrorism since 2000.

Terrorist activity increased by 80 per cent in 2014 to its highest recorded level. The largest ever year-on-year increase in deaths from terrorism was recorded in 2014, rising from 18,111 in 2013 to 32,685 in 2014. Terrorism deaths spread geographically as well with the number of countries experiencing over 500 deaths increasing from five to 11.

The rise in terrorism can largely be attributed to two groups: [[ISIS]]; and [[Boko Haram]], the Nigerian jihadist group that pledged allegiance to ISIS in March 2015. Combined, these groups were responsible for 51% of all terrorism-related deaths in 2014.

In the West, lone wolf attacks account for 70 per cent of terrorist deaths since 2006. Amongst lone actors, few attacks were inspired by Islamic fundamentalism, with 80 per cent of attacks were attributed to a range of right-wing extremists, nationalists, and other types of political extremism and supremacism.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2014 were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. Terrorism increased most significantly in Nigeria, where deaths increased by over 300 per cent to 7,512 fatalities.

===2016===
[[File:Global Terrorism Index 2016 by country.svg|thumb|A world map indicating the GTI by country (2016)]]
The fourth edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2016. The study covered analysis of 163 countries. Overall, the global GTI score decreased by six per cent.

In 2015, the number of deaths from terrorism decreased by ten percent, the first decline since 2010. However, the 29,376 deaths recorded still rank 2015 as the second deadliest year on record. While much attention has been devoted to ISIL, the Taliban recorded its deadliest year in Afghanistan.

As with the past three years, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria suffered the highest levels of terrorism, accounting for 72 per cent of all deaths from terrorism in 2015. Large decreases in fatalities in Iraq and Nigeria accounted for a large portion of the worldwide decrease.

Conversely, in OECD member countries, deaths from terrorism dramatically increased in 2015, rising by 650 per cent when compared to 2014. Twenty-one of the 34 OECD countries experienced at least one terrorist attack with the majority of deaths occurring in Turkey and France. Of attacks conducted in the United States, 98 per cent were carried out by lone actors, resulting in 156 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/global-terrorism-index-2016-developed-countries-suffer-dramatic-rise-deaths-a7419396.html|title=The 10 developed countries that have suffered the most deaths from terrorism|date=2016-11-15|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The fifth edition of the Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2017. The study covered analysis of 163 countries. The global GTI scored deteriorated by four per cent from 2015 to 2016.

Overall, deaths from terrorism have fallen for the second consecutive year, resulting in a 22 per cent decrease since the peak in 2014. At an all-time high, 106 countries experienced at least one terrorist attack. Of these, 77 countries recorded at least one death, an increase from 65 countries in 2015.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Pakistan remain the top five countries most affected by terrorism, however Nigeria also saw the greatest reduction in deaths. In 2016, deaths attributed to Boko Haram decreased by 80 per cent, however, deaths attributed to ISIL increased by 49 per cent. Together these five countries accounted for three quarters of all deaths from terrorism in 2016.

OECD countries have experienced a rise in terrorism, accounting for one per cent of global deaths from terrorism in 2016. In 2010 OECD countries accounted for just 0.1 per cent of deaths. Attacks in OECD countries have shifted tactics since 2014 to utilize simpler methods against non-traditional targets. Less sophisticated attacks can be executed at a lower cost and can be more difficult to detect. Positively, the first six months of 2017 have recorded 82 deaths from terrorism, lower than the 265 deaths in 2016.

Founded in 2006 by its Executive Director Josette Melchor and Board Chairman Peter Hirshberg, Gray Area joins similarly focused institutions, like [[Eyebeam Art and Technology Center]] and [[Ars Electronica]], in promoting the intersections of art, technology and community by working to produce, exhibit, and develop the creative technical skills that allow for experimentation with and exploration of the most contemporary technologies.

==History==
Following a conversation in 2006 about the lack of proper venues for the exhibition of new media and technology based art work, Melchor and Hirshberg initially opened ''Gray Area Gallery'' in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|South of Market (SoMa)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=forward/slash: The Gray Area Foundation for the Arts Story | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ulwcLVzT7w | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mid-Market Street Monitor | title=Examiner on Mid-Market Street revival | url=http://www.midmarketstreet.com/2009/07/examiner-on-mid-market-street-revival.html | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the gallery incorporated as a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] and was renamed ''Gray Area Foundation for The Arts''. In June 2009, Gray Area relocated to its present facility near the end of Taylor Street . In total, the {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location had included in addition to the pornography arcade, a bar (Club 65) and liquor store. Leased from property owner Jack Sumski, the space allowed Gray Area to expand its well-established exhibition platform to include artist residencies, educational workshops and symposiums, growing Gray Area into the comprehensive and integrated center for the creation and promotion of technology-based art it is today.

==History==
Green chemistry emerged from a variety of existing ideas and research efforts (such as [[atom economy]] and [[catalysis]]) in the period leading up to the 1990s, in the context of increasing attention to problems of chemical pollution and [[resource depletion]]. The development of green chemistry in Europe and the United States was linked to a shift in environmental problem-solving strategies: a movement from [[command and control regulation]] and mandated reduction of industrial emissions at the "end of the pipe," toward the active prevention of pollution through the innovative design of production technologies themselves. The set of concepts now recognized as green chemistry coalesced in the mid- to late-1990s, along with broader adoption of the term (which prevailed over competing terms such as "clean" and "sustainable" chemistry).&lt;ref name="WoodhouseBreyman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Breyman | first2 = S. | title = Green chemistry as social movement? | journal = Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–222 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1177/0162243904271726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linthorst"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10698-009-9079-4 | title = An overview: Origins and development of green chemistry | journal = Foundations of Chemistry | volume = 12 | pages = 55 | year = 2009 | last1 = Linthorst | first1 = J. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] played a significant early role in fostering green chemistry through its pollution prevention programs, funding, and professional coordination. At the same time in the United Kingdom, researchers at the [[University of York]] contributed to the establishment of the Green Chemistry Network within the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], and the launch of the journal ''[[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]]''.&lt;ref name="Linthorst" /&gt;

==Principles==
In 1998, [[Paul Anastas]] (who then directed the Green Chemistry Program at the US EPA) and [[John Warner (chemist)|John C. Warner]] (then of [[Polaroid Corporation]]) published a set of principles to guide the practice of green chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anastas | first1 = Paul T. | authorlink1 = Paul Anastas | last2 = Warner | first2 = John C. | authorlink2 = John Warner (chemist) | title = Green chemistry: theory and practice | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1998 | location = Oxford [England]; New York | isbn = 9780198502340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve principles address a range of ways to reduce the environmental and health impacts of chemical production, and also indicate research priorities for the development of green chemistry technologies.

The principles cover such concepts as:

* the design of processes to maximize the amount of raw material that ends up in the product;
* the use of [[renewable material]] feedstocks and [[renewable energy|energy]] sources;
* the use of safe, environmentally benign substances, including solvents, whenever possible;
* the design of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] processes;
* [[Waste minimisation|avoiding the production of waste]], which is viewed as the ideal form of [[waste management]].

The '''twelve principles of green chemistry''' are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html|title=12 Principles of Green Chemistry - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Prevention'''. Preventing waste is better than treating or cleaning up waste after it is created.
# '''[[Atom economy]].''' Synthetic methods should try to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product.
# '''Less hazardous chemical syntheses'''. Synthetic methods should avoid using or generating substances toxic to humans and/or the environment.
# '''Designing safer chemicals.''' Chemical products should be designed to achieve their desired function while being as non-toxic as possible.
# '''Safer solvents and auxiliaries'''. Auxiliary substances should be avoided wherever possible, and as non-hazardous as possible when they must be used.
# '''Design for energy efficiency'''. Energy requirements should be minimized, and processes should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure whenever possible.
# '''Use of renewable feedstocks'''. Whenever it is practical to do so, renewable feedstocks or raw materials are preferable to non-renewable ones.
# '''Reduce derivatives'''. Unnecessary generation of derivatives—such as the use of [[protecting group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s—should be minimized or avoided if possible; such steps require additional reagents and may generate additional waste.
# '''Catalysis'''. [[Catalysis|Catalytic]] reagents that can be used in small quantities to repeat a reaction are superior to [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] reagents (ones that are consumed in a reaction).
# '''Design for degradation'''. Chemical products should be designed so that they do not pollute the environment; when their function is complete, they should break down into non-harmful products.
# '''Real-time analysis for pollution prevention'''. Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to permit real-time, in-process monitoring and control ''before'' hazardous substances form.
# '''Inherently safer chemistry for accident prevention'''. Whenever possible, the substances in a process, and the forms of those substances, should be chosen to minimize risks such as explosions, fires, and accidental releases.

== Trends ==
Attempts are being made not only to quantify the ''greenness'' of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as [[chemical yield]], the price of reaction components, safety in handling chemicals, hardware demands, energy profile and ease of product workup and purification. In one quantitative study,&lt;ref name=ecoscale&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Redox|reduction]] of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[aniline]] receives 64 points out of 100 marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an [[amide]] using [[Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide|HMDS]] is only described as adequate with a combined 32 points.

Green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/GreenNano_PEN8.pdf Green nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[nanomaterials]] are developed, the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long-term economic viability.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Examples==

===Green solvents===
Solvents are consumed in large quantities in many chemical syntheses as well as for cleaning and degreasing.  Traditional solvents are often toxic or are chlorinated.  Green solvents, on the other hand, are generally derived from renewable resources and biodegrade to innocuous, often a naturally occurring product.&lt;ref&gt;Prat, D.; Pardigon, O.; Flemming, H.-W.; Letestu, S.; Ducandas, V.; Isnard, P.; Guntrum, E.; Senac, T.; Ruisseau, S.; Cruciani, P.; Hosek, P., "Sanofi’s Solvent Selection Guide: A Step Toward More Sustainable Processes", Org. Proc. Res. Devel. 2013, 17, 1517-1525.  {{DOI|10.1021/op4002565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, J.; Chin, B.; Huibers, P. D. T.; Garcia-Valls, R.; Hatton, T. A., "Solvent Replacement for Green Processing", Environ. Health Persp. 1998, 106, 253-271. {{DOI|10.2307/3433925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic techniques===
Novel or enhanced synthetic techniques can often provide improved environmental performance or enable better adherence to the principles of green chemistry. For example, the 2005 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] was awarded, to Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, for the development of the [[Olefin metathesis|metathesis]] method in organic synthesis, with explicit reference to its contribution to green chemistry and "smarter production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2005 | work=The Nobel Foundation  | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/press.html | accessdate=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 review identified three key developments in green chemistry in the field of [[organic synthesis]]: use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] as green solvent, [[aqueous]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] for clean [[oxidation]]s and the use of hydrogen in [[asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/B502713F| title = Pursuing practical elegance in chemical synthesis| journal = Chemical Communications| issue = 14| pages = 1807| year = 2005| last1 = Noyori | first1 = R. | authorlink = Ryōji Noyori}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further examples of applied green chemistry are [[supercritical water oxidation]], [[on water reaction]]s, and [[dry media reaction]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Bioengineering]] is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms, such as [[shikimate]], a [[Tamiflu]] precursor which is [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by Roche in bacteria. [[Click chemistry]] is often cited{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry.  The concept of 'green pharmacy' has recently been articulated based on similar principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12649-012-9146-2| title = Towards a Greener Pharmacy by More Eco Design| journal = Waste and Biomass Valorization| volume = 3| issue = 4| pages = 395| year = 2012| last1 = Baron | first1 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon dioxide as blowing agent====
In 1996, [[Dow Chemical]] won the 1996 Greener Reaction Conditions award for their 100% [[carbon dioxide]] blowing agent for [[polystyrene]] foam production. Polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation.  Seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the United States alone. Traditionally, [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] and other [[ozone]]-depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets, presenting a serious [[environmental hazard]]. Flammable, explosive, and, in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements, but they present their own problems.  Dow Chemical discovered that [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] works equally as well as a blowing agent, without the need for hazardous substances, allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used in the process is reused from other industries, so the net carbon released from the process is zero.

===Hydrazine===
Addressing principle #2 is the Peroxide Process for producing [[hydrazine]] without cogenerating salt. Hydrazine is traditionally produced by the [[Olin Raschig process]] from [[sodium hypochlorite]] (the active ingredient in many [[bleach]]es) and [[ammonia]].  The net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine:&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq "Hydrazine" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:NaOCl  +  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaCl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In the greener [[Peroxide process]] hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant and the side product is water. The net conversion follows:
:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 
Addressing principle #4, this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents. [[Methyl ethyl ketone]] is used as a carrier for the hydrazine, the intermediate ketazine phase separates from the reaction mixture, facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent.

===1,3-Propanediol===
Addressing principle #7 is a green route to [[1,3-Propanediol|1,3-propanediol]], which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors.  It can be produced from renewable precursors via the [[bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol]] using a [[genetically modified]] [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurian, Joseph V. "A New Polymer Platform for the Future – Sorona from Corn Derived 1,3-Propanediol" Journal of Polymers and the Environment, Vol. 13, No. 2 (April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[diol]] is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets.

===Lactide===
[[File:Lactide.png|thumb|144px|right|Lactide]]
In 2002, Cargill Dow (now [[NatureWorks]]) won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their improved method for [[polymerization]] of [[polylactic acid]] . Unfortunately, lactide-base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. [[Lactic acid]] is produced by fermenting corn and converted to [[lactide]], the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient, tin-catalyzed cyclization. The L,L-lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable [[polymer]], which has some applications including [[textiles]] and apparel, cutlery, and food packaging. [[Wal-Mart]] has announced that it is using/will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks, doesn't require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes, and results in a high-quality polymer that is [[recyclable]] and compostable.

===Carpet tile backings===
In 2003 [[Shaw Industries]] selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, and its ability to be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type, nylon-6 provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production. From its inception, EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance, health, and environmental standpoint.  Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through [[elutriation]], grinding, and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components, but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified [[cradle-to-cradle design]].

[[File:Isomers of oleic acid.png|thumb|right|''Trans'' and ''cis'' fatty acids]]

===Transesterification of fats===
In 2005, [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM) and [[Novozymes]] won the Greener Synthetic Pathways Award for their [[enzyme]] interesterification process. In response to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandated labeling of [[trans-fats|''trans''-fats]] on nutritional information by January 1, 2006, Novozymes and ADM worked together to develop a clean, enzymatic process for the [[interesterification]] of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.  The result is commercially viable products without ''trans''-fats. In addition to the human health benefits of eliminating ''trans''-fats, the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water, prevents vast amounts of byproducts, and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted.

===Bio-succinic acid===
In 2011, the Outstanding Green Chemistry Accomplishments by a Small Business Award went to [[BioAmber Inc.]] for integrated production and downstream applications of bio-based [[succinic acid]]. Succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products. Traditionally, succinic acid is produced from petroleum-based feedstocks. BioAmber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering CO{{sub|2}} rather than emitting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/green-chemistry/2011-small-business-award |title=2011 Small Business Award |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory chemicals===
Several [[laboratory]] chemicals are controversial from the perspective of Green chemistry. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] created a "Green" Alternatives Wizard [http://ehs.mit.edu/greenchem/] to help identify alternatives. [[Ethidium bromide]], [[xylene]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[formaldehyde]] have been identified as "worst offenders" which have alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs A. (2009). [http://www.the-scientist.com/2009/07/1/55/1/ Green at the Bench]. ''The Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes: laboratory-scale reaction and purification methods.&lt;ref&gt;J-C Bradley ''et al.'', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13065-015-0085-4 &amp;ldquo;Predicting Abraham model solvent coefficients&amp;rdquo;], ''Chemistry Central Journal'' 9:12 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pharmaceutical Industry, both GSK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/c0gc00918k| title = Expanding GSK's solvent selection guide – embedding sustainability into solvent selection starting at medicinal chemistry| journal = Green Chemistry| volume = 13| issue = 4| pages = 854| year = 2011| last1 = Henderson | first1 = R.

== Legislation ==

===The EU===
In 2007, The EU put into place the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) program, which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe. This regulation (1907/2006) ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals' hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting/authorising uses of specific substances. ECHA, the EU Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the EU member states.

===United States===
The U.S. law that governs the majority of industrial chemicals (excluding pesticides, foods, and pharmaceuticals) is the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) of 1976. Examining the role of regulatory programs in shaping the development of green chemistry in the United States, analysts have revealed structural flaws and long-standing weaknesses in TSCA; for example, a 2006 report to the California Legislature concludes that TSCA has produced a domestic chemicals market that discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function, price, and performance.&lt;ref&gt;

Passed in 1990, the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990|Pollution Prevention Act]] helped foster new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing environmental problems before they happen.

In 2008, the State of California approved two laws aiming to encourage green chemistry, launching the [[California Green Chemistry Initiative]]. One of these statutes required California's [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control|Department of Toxic Substances Control]] (DTSC) to develop new regulations to prioritize "chemicals of concern" and promote the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The resulting regulations took effect in 2013, initiating DTSC's ''Safer Consumer Products Program''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contested definition==
There are ambiguities in the definition of green chemistry, and in how it is understood among broader science, policy, and business communities. Even within chemistry, researchers have used the term "green chemistry" to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner (i.e., the 12 principles).&lt;ref name="Linthorst" /&gt; While not all uses of the term are legitimate (see [[greenwashing]]), many are, and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly, the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked (or confused) with related concepts like [[green engineering]], [[environmental design]], or [[sustainability]] in general. The complexity and multifaceted nature of green chemistry makes it difficult to devise clear and simple [[Green chemistry metrics|metrics]]. As a result, "what is green" is often open to debate.&lt;ref name="MatusBarriers"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10737">The '''Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol''' is a tool that promotes and guides more sustainable [[hydropower]] projects. It is a methodology used to measure the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics.

Hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact. This is because the construction of a [[dam]], power plant and [[reservoir]] creates certain social and physical changes in the area it effects. The protocol provides a common language to allow governments, [[civil society]], financial institutions and the hydropower sector to talk about and evaluate [[sustainability]] issues.

Assessments are based on objective evidence and the results are presented in a standardised way, to show how new projects are being developed or how existing facilities are performing.

It has been designed to work on projects and facilities anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Protocol Basics|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application  ==

=== Purpose ===

The Protocol is used by different hydropower stakeholders for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - How it can help|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/How-can-it-help-.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular uses include: 
 
* Independent review of sustainability issues
* Guiding improvement of sustainability practice
* Comparison with international best practice
* Communication with stakeholders
* Facilitating access to finance
* Preparing clients to meet bank requirements
* Reducing investment risk

=== Users ===

[[Crédit Agricole]], [[Société Générale|Societe Generale]], [[Standard Chartered]], [[Citigroup|Citi]], and [[UBS]] now refer to the Protocol in their sector guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediacommun.ca-cib.com/sitegenic/medias/DOC/13870/2012-12-politique-sectorielle-rse-energie-hydroelectricite-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Document%20RSE/Finance%20responsable/Dams%20&amp;%20Hydropower%20Sector%20Policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sc.com/en/resources/global-en/pdf/sustainabilty/Dams_and_Hydropower_Position_Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citigroup.com/citi/environment/data/1160840_Sector_Brief_HydroPower.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/ubs/global/about_ubs/corporate_responsibility/UBS-ESR-framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] has analysed the value of the Protocol for use by their clients, concluding that it is a useful tool for guiding the development of sustainable hydropower in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Protocol for World Bank clients|url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/06/20106007/hydropower-sustainability-assessment-protocol-use-world-bank-clients-lessons-learned-recommendations|website = documents.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] has reviewed social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects, concluding that the Protocol currently offers the best available ‘measuring stick’ for the [[World Commission on Dams]] provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A review of social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects|url = http://pubs.iied.org/17517IIED.html|website = pubs.iied.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

A Protocol assessment takes place over a one-week period at the project site and provides a rapid sustainability check.

A Protocol assessment does not replace an [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental and social impact assessment]] (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time as a mandatory regulatory requirement. A Protocol assessment will, amongst other things, check the scope and quality of the ESIA which has been done.

To ensure high quality, all commercial use of the Protocol is carried out by accredited assessors. These assessors have significant experience of the hydropower sector or relevant sustainability issues, and have passed a rigorous accreditation course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Accredited Assessors|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Accredited-Assessors.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

=== Tools ===
The Protocol can be used at any stage of hydropower development, from the early planning stages through to operation.  Each project stage is assessed using a different tool: 
* The early stage tool, a screening tool for potential hydropower projects
* The preparation tool, which covers planning and design, management plans and commitments.
* The implementation tool, used through the construction phase.
* The operation tool, used on working projects.

=== Topics ===
The Protocol covers a range of topics that need to be understood to assess the overall sustainability of a hydropower project.

The name and range of topics changes slightly at different project stages.

==== Social aspects ====

*Communications and consultation
*Project benefits
*Project affected communities and livelihoods
*Resettlement 
*[[Indigenous peoples]]
*Labour and working conditions
*Public health
*Cultural heritage

==== Environmental aspects ====

*Environmental and social assessment and management  
*[[Biodiversity]] and invasive species 
*[[Erosion]] and [[sedimentation]]  
*Water quality  
*Waste, noise and air quality  
*[[Reservoir]] planning / preparation and filling / management  
*Downstream flow regimes

==== Business aspects ====

*[[Governance]]
*[[Procurement]]
*Integrated project management 
*Financial viability
*Economic viability

==== Technical aspects ====

*Demonstrated need and strategic fit
*Siting and design
*Hydrological resource
*Asset reliability and efficiency
*Infrastructure safety

The Protocol also includes ‘cross-cutting issues’ such as [[climate change]], [[gender]], and [[human rights]], which feature in multiple topics.

=== Criteria ===
For each sustainability topic, performance is assessed against a range of criteria at two levels: basic good practice and proven best practice.

== History  ==
A multi-stakeholder forum developed the Protocol between 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - History|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Protocol-development.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following key group were represented: social and environmental NGOs, governments of developed and developing countries, financial institutions, development banks, and the hydropower industry.

The forum jointly reviewed, enhanced and built consensus on what a sustainable hydropower project should look like.

Policies taken into account included the [[World Commission on Dams]]’ Criteria and Guidelines, World Bank Safeguard Policies, IFC Performance Standards, and the [[Equator Principles]].

A draft of the Protocol was released in 2009, which was trialled in 16 countries across six continents and subjected to further consultation involving 1,933 individual stakeholders from 28 countries.

The final version was produced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Download Protocol Document|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/The-Protocol-Documents.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of the forum was important to ensure that the Protocol became globally applicable and universally accepted. Diversity also ensured that the multiple perspectives and stakeholder interests surrounding a hydropower project were incorporated into the document.

== Governance  ==
The Protocol is governed by a multi-stakeholder body, the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Council (HSA Council).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Governance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Council is to ensure multi-stakeholder input and confidence in the Protocol's content and application.

All individuals and organisations engaged in hydropower are welcome and encouraged to join the Council. This approach to governance ensures that all stakeholder voices are heard in the shaping of the use of the Protocol and its future development.

The Council consists of a series of Chambers, each representing a different segment of hydropower stakeholders. Each chamber elects a chair and alternate chair for a two-year term. The chamber chairs come together regularly to form the decision-making Protocol Governance Committee. The current Governance Committee (elected May 2015) is shown in the table below.

The '''International Union for Conservation of Nature''' ('''IUCN'''; officially '''International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |publisher=IUCN |quote=The organisation changed its name to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 1956 with the acronym IUCN (or UICN in French and Spanish). This remains our full legal name to this day. |url=https://www.iucn.org/about|date=2014-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[international organization]] working in the field of [[nature conservation]] and sustainable use of [[natural resource]]s. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. IUCN's mission is to "influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable".

Over the past decades, IUCN has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to [[sustainable development]] in its projects. Unlike many other international environmental organisations, IUCN does not itself aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. It tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]], which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

IUCN has a membership of over 1400 governmental and non-governmental organizations. Some 16,000 scientists and experts participate in the work of IUCN commissions on a voluntary basis. It employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. Its headquarters are in [[Gland, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=About &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/about |title=About IUCN|publisher=IUCN |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN has [[Observer status#United Nations|observer]] and [[consultative status]] at the [[United Nations]], and plays a role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and [[biodiversity]].  It was involved in establishing the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]]. In the past, IUCN has been criticized for placing the interests of nature over those of indigenous peoples. In recent years, its closer relations with the business sector have caused controversy.&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya: The Maasai Stand up to IUCN Displacement Attempts from their Forest|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/84/Kenya.html|website=World Rainforest Movement|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Block |first=Ben |title=Environmentalists Spar Over Corporate Ties|type=updated version |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5934|website=[[Worldwatch Institute]]. worldwatch.org|accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN was established in 1948. It was previously called the '''International Union for the Protection of Nature''' (1948–1956) and the '''World Conservation Union''' (1990–2008).

===Overview===
'''Establishment'''&lt;ref name="holdgate"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holdgate|first1=Martin|title=The green web: a union for world conservation|date=1999|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=1 85383 595 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–38}}

IUCN was established on [[5 October]] [[1948]], in [[Fontainebleau]], France, when representatives of governments and conservation organizations signed a formal act constituting the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN). The initiative to set up the new organisation came from [[UNESCO]] and especially from its first Director General, the British biologist [[Julian Huxley]]. [[File:Julian Huxley 1964.jpg|thumb|Julian Huxley, the first Director General of UNESCO, took the initiative to set up IUCN]] The objectives of the new Union were to encourage international cooperation in the protection of nature, to promote national and international action and to compile, analyse and distribute information. At the time of its founding IUPN was the only international organisation focusing on the entire spectrum of nature conservation (an international organisation for the protection of birds, now [[BirdLife International]], had been established in 1922.)

'''Early years: 1948–1956'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|47–63}}&lt;br /&gt;
IUPN started out with 65 members. Its secretariat was located in Brussels. Its first work program focused on saving species and habitats, increasing and applying knowledge, advancing education, promoting international agreements and promoting conservation. Providing a solid scientific base for conservation action was the heart of all activities; commissions were set up to involve experts and scientists.

IUPN and UNESCO were closely associated. They jointly organized the 1949 Conference on Protection of Nature ([[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], USA). In preparation for this conference a list of gravely endangered species was drawn up for the first time, a precursor of the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]. In the early years of its existence IUCN depended almost entirely on UNESCO funding and was forced to temporarily scale down activities when this ended unexpectedly in 1954.

IUPN was successful in engaging prominent scientists and identifying important issues such as the harmful effects of [[pesticide]]s on wildlife but not many of the ideas it developed were turned into action. This was caused by unwillingness to act on the part of governments, uncertainty about the IUPN mandate and lack of resources. In 1956, IUPN changed its name to International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

'''Increased profile and recognition: 1956–1965'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|67–82}}&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1950s and 1960s Europe entered a period of economic growth and formal colonies became independent. Both developments had impact on the work of IUCN. Through the voluntary (i.e. ''[[pro bono]]'') involvement of experts in its Commissions IUCN was able to get a lot of work done while still operating on a low budget. It expanded its relations with UN-agencies and established links with the [[Council of Europe]]. In 1961, at the request of [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), the United Nations Economic and Social Council, IUCN published the first global list of national parks and protected areas which it has updated ever since. IUCN's best known publication, the Red Data Book on the conservation status of species, was first published in 1964.&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN began to play a part in the development of international treaties and conventions, starting with the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. Environmental law and policy making became a new area of expertise. [[File:Ngorongoro-Crater-Morning-Scene.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Africa was the first regional focus of IUCN conservation action]]
Africa was the focus of many of the early IUCN conservation field projects. IUCN supported the ‘Yellowstone model’ of protected area management, which severely restricted human presence and activity in order to protect nature. IUCN and other conservation organisations were criticized for protecting nature against people rather than with people. This model was initially also applied in Africa and played a role in the decision to remove the [[Maasai people]] from [[Serengeti]] National Park and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]].&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"/&gt;

To establish a stable financial basis for its work, IUCN participated in setting up the World Wildlife Fund (1961) (now the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] WWF). WWF would work on fundraising, public relations, and increasing public support. IUCN would continue to focus on providing sound science and data, and developing ties with international bodies. Funds raised by WWF would be used to cover part of the operational costs of IUCN. Also in 1961, the IUCN headquarters moved from Belgium to [[Morges]] in Switzerland.

'''Consolidating its position in the international environmental movement: 1966–1975'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|110–124}}&lt;br /&gt;
Public concerns about the state of the environment in the sixties and seventies led to the establishment of new NGOs, some of which (e.g. [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]]) also worked globally. Many of these new organisations were more activist and critical of government than IUCN which remained committed to providing science-based advice to governments. As a result, IUCN was criticized by some as being old-fashioned and irrelevant.

IUCN’s membership still grew (from 200 in 1961 to 350 in 1974) and its formal standing and influence increased. A grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1969 enabled it to boost its secretariat and expand operations. During the 1960s, IUCN lobbied the UN General Assembly to create a new status for NGOs. Resolution 1296, adopted in 1968, granted 'consultative' status to NGOs. IUCN itself was eventually accredited with six UN organizations.&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding NGOs|url=https://agendatwentyone.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/understanding-ngos-non-government-organizations/ |website=agendatwentyone.wordpress.com |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IUCN was one of the few environmental organisations formally involved in the preparations of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm, 1972). The Stockholm Conference eventually led to three new international conventions, with IUCN involved in their drafting and implementation:
* [[World Heritage Site|Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] (1972). IUCN co-drafted the World Heritage Convention with UNESCO and has been involved as the official Advisory Body on nature from the onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/world-heritage/about/iucn-and-world-heritage|title=IUCN and World Heritage|date=2015-11-10|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CITES]]- the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (1974) IUCN is a signatory party and the CITES secretariat was originally lodged with IUCN.
* [[Ramsar Convention]] – Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1975). The secretariat is still administered from IUCN's headquarters.

IUCN entered into an agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme [[UNEP]] to provide regular reviews of world conservation. The income this generated, combined with growing revenue via WWF, put the organisation on relatively sound financial footing for the first time since 1948.

This period saw the beginning of a gradual change in IUCN’s approach to conservation. Ensuring the survival of habitats and species remained its key objective, but there was a growing awareness that economic and social demands had to be taken into account. IUCN started to publish guidelines on sustainable development. In 1975 the IUCN General Assembly passed a resolution to retain indigenous peoples and cater for their traditional rights in National Parks and protected areas. As a result, IUCN became more appealing to organisations and governments in the developing world.

{{anchor|World Conservation Strategy}}
'''The World Conservation Strategy 1975–1985'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|132–165}}&lt;br /&gt;
In the late seventies, between its General Assemblies in [[Kinshasha]] (1975) and [[Ashkabad]] (1978), IUCN went through a phase of turbulence in governance and management. Its work program continued to grow, in part as a result of the partnership with WWF. In 1978, IUCN was running 137 projects, largely in the global south. The involvement of representatives from the developing world in the IUCN Council, Committees and staff increased.
In 1975 IUCN started work on the ''World Conservation Strategy''. [[File:Myanmar Illicit Endangered Wildlife Market 06.jpg|thumb|Stopping illegal trade of wildlife is one of IUCN's priorities]]The drafting process – and the discussions with the UN agencies involved – led to an evolution in thinking within IUCN and growing acceptance of the fact that conservation of nature by banning human presence no longer worked. (The debate about the balance between strict nature protection and conservation through sustainable development would, however, continue within IUCN well into the 1999
s.) The ''World Conservation Strategy'' was launched in 35 countries simultaneously on 5 March 1980. It set out fundamental principles and objectives for conservation worldwide, and identified priorities for national and international action. It is considered one of the most influential documents in 20th century nature conservation and one of the first official documents to introduce the concept of sustainable development. The Strategy was followed in 1982 by the ''[[World Charter for Nature]]'', which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], after preparation by IUCN.

In 1980, IUCN and WWF moved into shared new offices in [[Gland, Switzerland]]. This marked a phase of closer cooperation with WWF. It was the support of WWF that allowed IUCN to weather a financial crisis in 1980–1982. The close ties between IUCN and WWF were severed in 1985 when WWF decided to take control of its own field projects, which so far had been run by IUCN. In 1989, IUCN moved into a separate building in Gland, close to the offices it had shared with WWF.

'''Sustainable development and regionalisation: 1985 to present day'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|176–222}}&lt;br /&gt;
In 1982, IUCN set up a Conservation for Development Centre within its secretariat. The Centre undertook projects to ensure that nature conservation was integrated in development aid and in the economic policies of developing countries. Over the years, it supported the development of national conservation strategies in 30 countries. Several European countries began to channel considerable amounts of bilateral aid via IUCN’s projects. Management of these projects was primarily done by IUCN staff, often working from the new regional and country offices IUCN set up around the world. This marked a shift within the organisation. Previously the volunteer Commissions had been very influential, now the Secretariat and its staff began to play a more dominant role. Initially, the focus of power was still with the Headquarters in Gland but the regional offices and regional members’ groups gradually got a bigger say in operations.

In spite of the increased attention for sustainable development, the protection of habitats and species remained a core activity of IUCN. Special programs were developed for Antarctica, tropical forests and wetlands, and IUCN expanded its operations in Latin America.

In 1991, IUCN (together with UNEP and WWF) published ''Caring for the Earth'', a successor to the World Conservation Strategy. It was published in the run-up to the [[Earth Summit]], the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. The ''World Conservation Strategy'', ''Caring for the Earth'', and the ''Global Diversity Strategy ''(also published in 1992 by UNEP, IUCN, and WRI) are considered hugely influential in shaping the global environmental agenda. They lay the foundations for the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], a new global treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity developed by UNEP with support from IUCN, the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs"/&gt;

Social aspects of conservation were now integrated in IUCN’s work; projects began to take account of the role of women in natural resource management and to value the knowledge indigenous peoples have about their natural environment.  At the General Assembly in 1994 the IUCN mission was redrafted to its current wording to include the equitable and ecologically use of natural resources.

IUCN’s current work makes direct contributions towards achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular, IUCN’s Programme 2017–2020 focusing on SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (Climate action), SDG 14 (Life below water), SDG 15 (Life on land), SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals).&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/programme-work-and-reporting/programme|title=IUCN Programme|last=|first=|date=2015-10-01|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:IUCN-Headquarters.jpg|thumb|IUCN-Headquarters in Gland, Switzerland]]

'''Closer to business: 2000 to present day'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since the creation of IUCN in 1948, IUCN Members have passed more than 300 resolutions that include or focus on business related activities. The range of topics covers in these resolutions varies greatly, including a focus on fisheries, tourism, agriculture, the extractive industries and the business sector in general.

The increased attention on sustainable development as a means to protect nature brought IUCN closer to the corporate sector. A discussion started about cooperation with business, including the question if commercial companies could become IUCN members. The members decided against this, but IUCN did forge a partnership with the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]. IUCN renewed a multi-year MOU with them with WBCSD in December 2015.

In 1996, after decades of seeking to address specific business issues, IUCN’s Members asked for a comprehensive approach to engaging the business sector. Resolution 1.81 of the IUCN World Conservation Congress held that year “urged IUCN Members and the Director General, based on the need to influence private sector policies in support of the Mission of IUCN, to expand dialogue and productive relationships with the private sector and find new ways to interact with members of the business community”.

The IUCN Global Business and Biodiversity Program (BBP) was established in 2003 to influence and support private partners in addressing environmental and social issues. The Program wants to engage with business sectors that have a significant impact on natural resources and livelihoods to promote sustainable use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Business and Biodiversity Programme|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/business/|website=IUCN|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the first IUCN Private Sector Engagement Strategy was developed (in response to Council Decision C/58/41). 
Most prominent in the Business and Biodiversity Program is the five-year collaboration IUCN started with the energy company [[Shell International]] in 2007. The aim was to mitigate the environmental impact of Shell's operations.  The partnership almost immediately came under fire from IUCN's members, especially the NGO-members who feared for IUCN’s reputation. At the World Conservation Congress (formerly the IUCN General Assembly) in Barcelona in 2008 NGO-members tabled a motion to terminate the Shell contract. The proposal was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN and Shell: Guiding the way|url=http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=434|website=Business &amp; Biodiversity|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195343/http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=434|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldwatch.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentalists spar over corporate ties|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5934|website=Worldwatch|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the World Conservation Congress held in the Republic of South Korea, the Union adopted a more focused approach to enable IUCN to deliver both on‐the‐ground results and fit‐for‐purpose knowledge products, working with many agencies, including business. The Business Engagement Strategy (2012) calls on IUCN to prioritise engagement with business sectors that have a significant impact on natural resources and livelihoods. These include: large 'footprint' industries, such as: mining and oil and gas; biodiversity-dependent industries including fishing, agriculture and forestry; and, financial services and “green” enterprises such as organic farming, renewable energy and nature-based tourism.

Furthermore, the IUCN Operational Guidelines for Business Engagement offer critical support to the implementation of the IUCN Business Engagement Strategy. First developed in 2006, and then revised in 2009 and again in 2015, they provide a consistent approach to the management of risks associated with engaging business, as well as outline the opportunities between the different types of engagement.

Today, the Business and Biodiversity Programme continues to set the strategic direction, coordinate IUCN’s overall approach and provide institutional quality assurance in all business engagements. The Programme ensures that the Business Engagement Strategy is implemented through IUCN’s global thematic and regional programmes as well as helps guide the work of IUCN’s six Commissions.

'''Championing Nature-based Solutions: 2009 to present day'''

[[Nature Based Solutions|Nature-based Solutions (NbS)]] use ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges such as climate change, food security or natural disasters.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46191|title=Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges {{!}} IUCN Library System|website=portals.iucn.org|access-date=2017-07-04|isbn=9782831718125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the NbS concept in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts came as international organisations, such as IUCN and the World Bank, searched for solutions to work with ecosystems rather than relying on conventional engineering interventions (such as seawalls), to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.

IUCN actively promoted the NbS concept in its 2009 position paper on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 15, and in 2012 IUCN formally adopted NbS as one of the three areas of work within its 2013–2016 Programme.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"/&gt;

At the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2016, IUCN Members agreed on a definition of nature-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077|title=077 – Defining Nature-based Solutions {{!}} 2016 Congress portal|website=portals.iucn.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature-based Solutions are defined as “actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”. Members also called for governments to include nature-based solutions in strategies to combat climate change . A report, ''Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges'', was launched at the Congress, and includes a set of general principles for any NbS intervention.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"/&gt;

Implementing NbS at scale can help countries achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goals. It can also help them achieve the [[land degradation]] neutrality goal of the UNCCD, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the CBD, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

==Current work==

=== IUCN Programme 2017–2020 ===
According to its website, IUCN works on the following themes: business, [[climate change]], economics, [[ecosystems]], [[environmental law]], [[forest protection|forest conservation]], [[gender]], global policy, [[marine habitats|marine]] and [[polar regions|polar]], [[protected areas]], science and knowledge, [[social policy]], [[species]], water and [[world heritage sites|world heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do|url=http://www.iucn.org/what/|website=IUCN|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN works on the basis of four-year programs, determined by the membership. In the IUCN Programme for 2017–2020 conserving nature and biodiversity is inextricably linked to sustainable development and poverty reduction.  IUCN states that it aims to have a solid factual base for its work and takes into account the knowledge held by indigenous groups and other traditional users of natural resources.

The IUCN Programme 2017–2020 identifies three priority areas:&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme"/&gt;

1. Valuing and conserving nature.

2. Promoting and supporting effective and equitable governance of natural resources

3. Deploying [[Nature Based Solutions]] to address societal challenges including climate change, food security and economic and social development.&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme" /&gt;

Unlike other environmental organisations, IUCN does not itself aim to directly mobilize the general public.  Education has been part of IUCN's work program since the early days but the focus is on stakeholder involvement and strategic communication rather than mass-campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEC – what we do|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/cec/cec_what_we_do/|website=IUCN|accessdate=26 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226162000/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/cec/cec_what_we_do/|archivedate=26 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitats and species===
IUCN runs field projects for [[habitat conservation|habitat]] and species conservation around the world. It produces the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems which in a similar way measures risks to ecosystems.
The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is a global standard to assess the conservation status of ecosystems. It is applicable at local, national, regional and global levels. It is based on a set of rules, or criteria, for performing evidence-based, scientific assessments of the risk of ecosystem collapse, as measured by reductions in geographical distribution or degradation of the key processes and components of ecosystems.

IUCN participates in efforts to restore [[critically endangered]] species. In 2012 it published a list of [[the world's 100 most threatened species]]. It wants to expand the global network of [[national parks]] and other [[protected areas]] and promote good management of such areas, for example through the publication of the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Green List' awards world's top conservation sites|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/11/iucn-sets-up-the-green-list|accessdate=18 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IUCN is the governing body responsible for the development of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|Protected Area Management Categories]] into which each protected area is divided depending on its conservation requirements and management aims. It also developed a standard to identify [[Key Biodiversity Areas]] — places of international importance for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/biodiversity-and-protected-areas/key-biodiversity-areas|title=Key Biodiversity Areas|date=2016-03-08|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it focuses on greater protection of the [[oceans]] and [[marine habitats]].

=== Business partnerships ===
IUCN has a growing program of partnerships with the corporate sector to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Globally, IUCN collaborates with Black Mountain Mining, Nespresso, Rio Tinto, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd, Shell, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, Ltd., the International Olympic Committee, Natural Capital Coalition, Renova Foundation, Tiffany Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and others.

At the national and regional level, IUCN also works with Marriott International in Thailand, the Zambezi Valley Development Agency (ADPP) in Mozambique, Minh Phu – the largest shrimp exporter in Vietnam, Xingzhitianxia Media Company in China, the Secretariat of the Southern Agriculture Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT), Tata Steel in India, Engro Elengy Terminal (Pvt) Ltd in Pakistan, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-001-v.1-En.pdf|title=IUCN 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and international policy ===
On the national level, IUCN helps governments prepare national biodiversity policies. Internationally, IUCN provides advice to environmental conventions such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[CITES]] and the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. It advises [[UNESCO]] on natural [[world heritage site|world heritage]].&lt;br /&gt;
It has a formally accredited permanent observer mission to the [[United Nations]] in New York. According to its own website, IUCN is the only international observer organization in the UN General Assembly with expertise in issues concerning the environment, specifically biodiversity, nature conservation and sustainable natural resource use.&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN has official relations with the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO),  the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), the [[UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] (UNEP-WCMC), the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO NGO database|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100033055|website=UNESCO|accessdate=4 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208140552/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100033055|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
As an organization, IUCN has three components: the member organizations, the six scientific commissions, and the secretariat.

===Members===
IUCN Members are states (making IUCN a supranational [[GONGO]]), government agencies, international nongovernmental organizations, national nongovernmental organizations, and indigenous peoples’ organisations. In 2017, IUCN had 1400 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/secretariat/201706/iucn-welcomes-13-new-members|title=IUCN welcomes 13 new Members|date=2017-06-06|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members can organize themselves in national or regional committees to promote cooperation. In 2016, there were 62 national committees and 7 regional committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-001-v.1-En.pdf|title=IUCN 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:USSR 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet]] Stamp commemorating the 1978 IUCN General Assembly in [[Ashgabat]]]]

===Commissions===
The six IUCN Commissions involve 16,000 volunteer experts from a range of disciplines. They 'assess the state of the world’s natural resources and provide the Union with sound know-how and policy advice on conservation issues'.&lt;ref name="IUCNCommissions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/ | title = IUCN – Commissions |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Commission on Education and Communication (CEC): communication, learning and knowledge management in IUCN and the wider conservation community. Members: over 1300
* Commission on Environmental, Economic, and Social Policy (CEESP): economic and social factors for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Members: 1465.
* World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL): developing new legal concepts and instruments, and building the capacity of societies to employ environmental law for conservation and sustainable development. Members: 800.
* Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM): integrated ecosystem approaches to the management of natural and modified ecosystems. Members: 1000.
* Species Survival Commission (SSC): technical aspects of species conservation and action for species that are threatened with [[extinction]]. Members: 7500.
* World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA):  establishment and effective management of a network of terrestrial and marine protected areas. Members: 1300. {{Main article|World Commission on Protected Areas}}

===Secretariat===
The Secretariat is led by the Director General. For management of its operations IUCN distinguishes eight geographical regions; each is led by a director who reports to the Director General.&lt;br /&gt;
The IUCN head office is in [[Gland]], Switzerland. Eight regional offices implement IUCN’s program in their respective territories. Since 1980, IUCN has established offices in more than 50 countries. The total number of staff grew from 100 (1980) to around 1,000 (2014);  nearly all this growth was in the national and regional offices. Approximately 150 staff are based in the head office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IUCN|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/|website=IUCN|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==

===Governance===
[[File:Inger2 (5243802649).jpg|thumb|[[Inger Andersen (environmentalist)|Inger Andersen]], IUCN Director General since January 2015]]The '''World Conservation Congress''' (Members’ Assembly) is IUCN’s highest decision-making body. The Congress convenes every four years, most recently in [[Hawaii]] (2016) and previously in Jeju, South Korea (2012). It elects the Council, including the President, and approves IUCN’s workprogram for the next four years, and budget.

The IUCN '''Council''' is the principal governing body of IUCN. The Council provides strategic direction for the activities of the Union, discusses specific policy issues and provides guidance on finance and the membership development of the Union. The Council is composed of the President, four Vice Presidents (elected by the Council from among its members), the Treasurer, the Chairs of IUCN's six Commissions, three Regional Councillors from each of IUCN's eight Statutory Regions and a Councillor from the State in which IUCN has its seat (Switzerland).  IUCN's current President is [[Zhang Xinsheng]].

The Council appoints a '''Director General''', who is responsible for the overall management of IUCN and the running of the Secretariat. [[Inger Andersen (environmentalist)|Inger Andersen]] is IUCN Director General since January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inger Andersen named IUCN Director General|url=http://www.iucn.org/?18465/Inger-Andersen-named-IUCN-Director-General|website=IUCN|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She succeeded [[Julia Marton-Lefèvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Union|url=http://iucn.org/about/union/|website=IUCN|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
IUCN’s total income in 2013 was 114 million CHF, equaling approximately 95 million Euro or 116 million US dollar.&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN’s funding mainly comes from Official Development Assistance budgets of bilateral and multilateral agencies. This represented 61% of its income in 2013. Additional sources of income are the membership fees, as well as grants and project funding from foundations, institutions and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Annual Report 2013|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/IUCN-2014-017.pdf|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticism==

===Influence===
IUCN is considered one of the most influential conservation organisations in the world and, together with WWF and the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI), is seen as a driving force behind the rise of the influence of environmental organisations at the UN and around the world.&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is IUCN"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is IUCN?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-iucn.htm|website=WiseGeek|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It has established a network covering all aspects of global conservation via its worldwide membership of governmental and non-governmental organisations, the participation of experts in the IUCN Commissions, formal involvement in international agreements, ties to intergovernmental organisations and increasingly partnerships with international business. The World Conservation Congress and the World Parks Congress events organised by IUCN are the largest gatherings of organisations and individuals involved in conservation worldwide.  They involve governmental organisations, NGOs, media, academia and the corporate sector. &lt;br /&gt;
According to some, IUCN is not only a major global player in conservation action, but also has considerable influence in defining what nature conservation actually is.&lt;ref name="IUCN: A History of Constraint"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Kenneth|title=IUCN: A History of Constraint|publisher=UCLouvain|url=http://perso.uclouvain.be/marc.maesschalck/MacDonaldInstitutional_Reflexivity_and_IUCN-17.02.03.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems determine which species and natural areas merit protection. Through the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas and the system of [[IUCN protected area categories]] IUCN influences how protected areas are managed.

===Criticism===
The relevance of the scientific insights and the data that IUCN produces are not often drawn into question, but IUCN has encountered criticism in other matters.

It has been claimed that IUCN put the needs of nature above those of humans, disregarding economic considerations and the interests of indigenous peoples and other traditional users of the land. Until the 1980s IUCN favored the "Yellowstone Model’ of conservation which called for the removal of humans from protected areas. The expulsion of the [[Maasai people]] from [[Serengeti National Park]] and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] is perhaps the best known example of this approach.&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holdgate"/&gt;[[File:Ngorongoro 2012 05 30 2353 (7500935618).jpg|thumb|IUCN's relationships with local land users like the Maasai have caused controversy in the past]]
This is linked to another criticism that has been directed at IUCN, namely that throughout its history it has mainly been ‘Northern focused’, i.e. had a West-European or North-American perspective on global conservation.  Some critics point to the fact that many individuals involved in the establishment of IUCN had been leading figures in the British Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of Empire, which wanted to protect species against the impact of ‘native’ hunting pressure in order to safeguard hunting by Europeans.&lt;ref name="IUCN: A History of Constraint"/&gt; The fact that at least until the 1990s,  most of IUCN staff, the chairs of the Commissions and the IUCN President came from western countries has also led to criticism.&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt; Over the past decade, IUCN has changed its approach. It now aims to work in close cooperation with indigenous groups. It has also become more regionalized in its operations and more truly global in its staffing.&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt; At the 2016 World Conservation Congress, IUCN introduced a new membership category for indigenous peoples’ organisations in recognition of their role in conserving the planet.

More recently, activist environmental groups have argued that IUCN is too closely associated with governmental organisations and with the commercial sector.&lt;ref name="What is IUCN"/&gt;  IUCN’s cooperation with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] came in for criticism, also from its own membership.&lt;ref name="worldwatch.org"/&gt; IUCN's close partnership with [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] in Vietnam – where they have together been launching Coca-Cola-focused community centers – has also drawn some criticism and allegations of [[greenwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/ur/node/26042|title=What's an EKOCENTER and what does it do?|date=2016-04-04|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-06-20|language=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/04/coca-cola-coke-water-neutral|title=Greenwash: Are Coke's green claims the real thing?|date=2008-12-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2985093/never_mind_the_greenwash_coca_cola_can_never_be_water_neutral.html|title=Never mind the greenwash – Coca Cola can never be 'water neutral'|work=The Ecologist|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its decision to hold the 2012 World Conservation Congress on [[Jeju Island]], South Korea, where the local community and international environmental activists were protesting against the construction of a navy base also led to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeju island navy base controversy divides iucn|url=http://biodiversitymedia.ning.com/profiles/blogs/jeju-island-navy-base-controversy-divides-iucn|website=Biodiversity media alliance|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IUCN remains committed to its partnerships with the business sector, seeing sustainable development as the way to ensure long-term protection of natural areas and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Natural capital must be the way forward, says IUCN director general|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/natural-capital-way-forward-iucn|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2013-11-11|last1=Smedley|first1=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
IUCN has a wide range of publications, reports, guidelines and databases related to conservation and [[sustainable development]]. It publishes or co-authors more than 100 books and major assessments every year, along with hundreds of reports, documents and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/resources/publications|title=Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 76 IUCN articles were published in peer reviewed scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|title=IUCN Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|publisher=IUCN|year=|isbn=|location=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|pages=Page 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report, released at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney on 13 November 2014 showed that the 209,000 conservation reserves around the world now cover 15.4 per cent of the total land area. The new figures are a step in the right direction of protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of ocean environments on Earth by 2020 since an agreement between the world's nations at the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], held in Japan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big increase in Earth’s protected areas|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/11/big-increase-in-earth%E2%80%99s-protected-areas|accessdate=17 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its World Conservation Congress in Hawaii in 2016, the IUCN launched a report ''Explaining ocean warming: causes, scale, effects and consequences'', one of the most comprehensive reviews to date on ocean warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46254 |title=Explaining ocean warming |last1=Baxter |first1=J.M. |last2=Laffoley |first2= Daniel D'A|date= September 5, 2016|website= |publisher=IUCN |accessdate= September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Buddhist]] [[Nikāya]] and [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]] literature there is reference to ''jātismara'' as first of the three ''[[vidyā]]s'' ('sciences'), as the fourth of the five ''[[abhijñā]]s'' ('superknowledges') and as the eighth of the ten ''[[Tathagata|tathagātadaśabala]]'' (powers of a ''[[tathagata]]''); it is listed as a faculty connected with the higher stages of meditation as a yogic attainment through control of the body and purity of body and conduct, as the result of abiding in a particular ''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]''. The [[Mahayana|Mahayāna Buddhist literature]] refers to ''jātismara'' not as an individual’s meditational development but as effected by a [[Bodhisattva]] for improving religious life, or as a religious gain, as an ''anuśamsa'' ('blessing') through a third kind of non-meditational activity but connected with the sacred texts and with ''dhāranīs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Figments and Fragments of Mahayana Buddhism|author=Gregory Schopen|publisher=-University of Hawaii Press|pages=190–195|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9SBD45jetbEC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=jatismara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BWbb4A4sz-&amp;sig=ENkRT_L1FgEvvaZe7Sp2o5KcIbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OlzoVLToH8-LuATvgoKQBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=jatismara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhagavata Purana]] (III.xxvi.30) tells us that memory is a characteristic of intelligence, that ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' clouds intelligence and causes false identification (III.xxxi.20), that a person when born is bereft of memory (III.xxxi.23) when all wisdom gained in the past birth(s) is lost (III.xxxi.24).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavat Purana|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto3/c3-contents.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory is the link between body and soul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">[[Image:Gedimin grav xvii.jpg|thumb|Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania]]

There are 6 surviving transcripts of '''letters of Gediminas''' written in 1323–1324 by Grand Duke [[Gediminas]]. These letters are one of the first surviving documents from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Since they were sent to the Western Europe, the pope, merchants, and craftspeople, they were written in [[Latin]].

The first letter was written to [[Pope John XXII]]. Gediminas claimed that the [[Teutonic Knights]] did not act in the interest of the Catholic faith. Instead, they brutally devastated the land. The people were forced into resistance. Gediminas enumerated many crimes and damages done by the knights; for example, he claimed that his predecessor [[Vytenis]] sent a letter to the [[Franciscan]] monks asking for two brothers who could come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to look after a local church. When the Teutonic Knights learned about the letter, they sent their army and destroyed the church. In the last sentence Gediminas vaguely promised to accept Christianity and obey the pope.

The second letter was written on January 25, 1323 to the German cities of [[Lübeck]], [[Sund, Sweden|Sund]], [[Bremen]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Cologne]] and other cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gediminas explained that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was very tolerant to the Christians, but remained pagan and did not accept Christianity only because of brutal Teutonic Knights. He told about the first letter sent to the pope and his intentions to baptize in the Catholic rite. Gediminas invited knights, [[squire]]s, merchants, doctors, smiths, wheelwrights, [[shoemaking|cobbler]]s, [[Skinner (profession)|skinners]], millers, and others to come to the Grand Duchy and practice their trade and faith without any restrictions. The peasants were promised tax exemption for ten years. The merchants were also exempt from any tariffs or taxes. This letter is best known because [[Vilnius]], capital of Lithuania, was mentioned in written sources for the first time. Therefore, 1323 is considered to be the official founding year of Vilnius. Gediminas is considered to be the city's founder even though the city existed years before Gediminas' reign. Also, Vilnius is unambiguously mentioned as the capital city. His invitation notably included German Jews as well as Christians, and its issuance is closely linked to the establishment of the [[Litvaks|Jewish community in Lithuania]].

The third letter addressed to Lübeck, [[Rostock]], Sund, [[Greifswald]], [[Stetin]], [[Gotland]] cities was written on May 26, 1323. In essence it repeated the second letter. It asked for various craftspeople (the list of crafts was expanded) to come to Lithuania and practice their trade. It said that there were three churches in the duchy: two Franciscan (in Vilnius and in [[Navahradak]]) and one [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. Everyone was free to use them.

The fourth and the fifth letters were also written on May 26, 1323 and were addressed to the Franciscan and Dominican Orders. Gediminas, in anticipation of his baptism, invited priests and monks to come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also asked to spread the word to craftspeople that they were welcome in Lithuania. In the letter to the Dominicans, Gediminas mentioned that his seal was burned by the Teutonic Knights.

The last surviving letter was written on September 22, 1324 and was addressed to the bishop of [[Tartu]], Erzel, ruler of [[Tallinn]] land, and Council of [[Riga]]. It reported that the Teutonic Knights violated a peace treaty signed earlier. The Knights attacked border regions, killed residents, and took all valuables. Many messengers were captured and killed. Gediminas asked for help enforcing the treaty.

'''Little Miss Nobody''' is the name posthumously given to a young girl whose body was found in [[Congress, Arizona|Congress]], [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]], [[Arizona]] on July 31, 1960. Her body is estimated to have been discovered between one and two weeks of the date of her death.

Due to the advanced state of [[decomposition]] of the child's remains, the specific [[cause of death|cause of her death]] has never been established, although it has always been considered to be a [[homicide]]. Furthermore, despite extensive local and national efforts to discover the identity of this child, her identity remains [[unidentified decedent|unknown]], and the case remains unsolved.

This unidentified decedent became known as "Little Miss Nobody" after no family or friends came forward to either report her [[missing person|missing]], or to claim her body. Following recent advances in technology, a [[forensic facial reconstruction]] of ''Little Miss Nobody'' was released to the media in 2018 in renewed efforts to identify this unidentified [[child murder]] victim's remains.

==Discovery and examination==
The partially buried body&lt;ref name=trying/&gt; of a female child was found in Sand Wash Creek Bed on Old Alamo Road in [[Congress, Arizona]] on July 31, 1960.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidentified Girl Buried|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=The Free-Lance Star|date=August 11, 1960|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=9fRKRCJz75UC&amp;dat=19600811&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was discovered by a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] schoolteacher named Russell Allen, who had been searching for rocks to decorate his garden,&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=found/&gt; and was found buried in a sitting position, with her arms stretched outwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby Doe Missed Her Chance at Life but Regained Name |date=November 10, 1996 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/news/mn-63244_1_baby-jane-doe |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators at the scene observed that the individual or individuals responsible for the child's burial had possibly made two separate attempts to dig an alternate grave for her body. This was determined by two evident disturbances in the sand close to the actual burial site.&lt;ref name=found/&gt;

The body was clothed in white shorts and a checkered blouse with a distinctive chain pattern, along with a pair of adult rubber thong [[sandal]]s that had been cut to fit the child's feet and fastened with leather straps.&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 10741|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/10741|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=May 13, 2015|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidentified Body Found on Desert|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=Prescott Evening Courier|date= August 1, 1960|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=MNNNGtAgD4EC&amp;dat=19600801&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; The child's toes and fingernails had reportedly been painted a bright red color. Investigators also found an apparently bloodstained pocket knife near the body, but were unable to definitively determine whether this utensil held any relation to the crime scene.&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=found/&gt;

The [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] who performed the autopsy determined that the body was that of a [[Caucasian race|white]] girl between the ages of 5- and 7-years old,&lt;ref name="trying"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeHoff|first1=Faye|title=Trying to identify "Little Miss Nobody"|url=http://www.kvoa.com/story/37833294/trying-to-identify-little-miss-nobody|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=News 4 Tucson|agency=NBC|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 feet–6 inches to 4 feet–5 inches in height, and likely weighing 50 to 60 pounds (later examinations of the child's remains indicated she may have been as old as 9&lt;ref name=found/&gt; or as young as 2 at the time of her death).

(Although the actual race of the decedent has since been described as being indeterminable, the highest likelihood of her actual age at the time of her death has since been determined as being 3 to 6 years.&lt;ref name=buried&gt;{{cite news|title='Little Miss Nobody' Buried by Community|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=Rome News-Tribune|date=August 11, 1960|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19600811&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who is 'Little Miss Nobody'?

The actual [[cause of death]] of the decedent was never determined by [[medical examiner]]s,&lt;ref name=buried/&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; although her death was officially declared to be a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;''Someone's Daughter: In Search of Justice for Jane Doe'' {{ISBN|978-1-589-79420-7}} p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the forensic pathologist was able to definitively state that she had not suffered any [[bone fracture]]s at the time of her death, or in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mendocino County Cold Case Identifications Made Nearly 37 Years Later |date=March 28, 2018 |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/03/28/little-miss-nobody-sheriffs-office-hopes-image-helps-solve-58-year-old-case/467973002/ |publisher=Arizona Central |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the contemporary report pertaining to the child's autopsy indicates her remains were charred, presumably from her body having been set alight around the time of her death.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jaime|title=Little Miss Nobody|url=http://blog.jaimegipe.com/2011/03/little-miss-nobody/|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the decedent had been in an advanced state of decomposition at the time of her discovery, creating an actual [[facial composite|composite drawing]] of the child's facial features was not possible.&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEC/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Contemporary records retained at the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] state the child's face had actually been in a "recognizable" state at the time of her discovery.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;}}

===Initial investigations===
With active assistance from the local media, private citizens, and (later) assistance from officials as eminent as individuals within the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the Yavapai County sheriff's office worked tirelessly in their efforts to discover the decedent's identity. An [[all-points bulletin]] was initially broadcast across all sheriff radio and [[teletype]] networks following the discovery of this child's body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clue to 'Little Miss Nobody' Still Sought |date=November 4, 1960 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19601104&amp;id=BhxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6557%2C19 |publisher=Prescott Evening Courier |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yavapai County Sheriff Jim Cramer, Deputy County Attorney George Ireland and other local law enforcement personnel would subsequently travel hundreds of miles in radius via both air and land in their efforts to discover her identity. Individuals previously convicted of various offenses involving young children would be subjected to prolonged interrogations, and the sheriff's office also received dozens of letters, telephone calls, and telegrams in response to their public appeals for information in their efforts to discover the child's identity. Furthermore, any possibility the decedent had been any known missing young girl was investigated, and discounted.{{refn|group=n|Investigators initially speculated that this decedent may have hailed from an [[Poverty|impoverished]] background, and/or have been the child of migrants, although all investigative lines of inquiry into these theories failed to bear fruition.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;}}
[[File:LMN sandals.jpg|thumb|right|The sandals worn by the decedent]]

By August 1960, investigators began to suspect the remains may have been those of a four-year-old girl named Sharon Lee Gallegos, who had been abducted in [[New Mexico]] ten days before the discovery of the child's body. Despite the fact that the clothing the victim wore was inconsistent to that Gallegos was last seen wearing, they could not eliminate Gallegos as being the decedent due to this fact, as the clothing could have easily been changed in the intervening week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Officers Still Seek Clues {{not a typo|T}}o Identify Body of Girl: Missing Girl in N.M.

Initial speculation that the child may have been a member of a family of transients, also from New Mexico. Police also subjected one Lester Davidson and two of his four children to in excess of an hour of questioning. Davidson and his children had been known to have been hitchhiking near [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] in late July 1960. This questioning concluded that the family likely had no connection to either the unidentified child or Sharon Gallegos.

Following the verification of the Davidsons' [[alibi]]s, police sent the clothing, knife, and  footprints found with or near the child's body to an [[FBI]] laboratory to undergo further examination.&lt;ref name=footprints&gt;{{cite news |title=Footprints may lead to body ID |work=Prescott Evening Courier |date=August 5, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1961, a possibility arose that the decedent may have been one Debbie Dudley; a four-year-old girl missing from [[Virginia]]. Investigators had failed to find the bodies of Dudley and her remaining siblings after the body of her seven-year-old sister, Carol Ann, was found wrapped in a blanket on February 9, 1961, she having died due to a combination of the [[malnutrition]], [[Infant exposure|exposure]], and [[Child neglect|neglect]] she had endured from her parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Little Miss: She's 'God's Little Child'|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19610302&amp;id=L29QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3348,708824&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 27, 2015|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=March 2, 1961|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie's remains were later found in [[Southern Virginia]]. She was later interred alongside her sister. The parents of the sisters were later charged with both murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debbie to Be Buried Beside Sister|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19610316&amp;id=-3ksAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1ssEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1343,1944727&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 27, 2015|work=The Spartanburg Herald|agency=Herald-Journal|date=March 16, 1961|location=Spartanburg, South Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 1961, Sheriff Cramer led a party of law enforcement officers and a camera crew to film the location where the child's body had been found.&lt;ref name=screen/&gt; Later that afternoon, Sheriff Cramer and Yavapai County Attorney George Ireland presented evidence—including the adult-sized rubber sandals which had been purposely cut to fit the child's feet&lt;ref name=network/&gt;—to the media, with Sheriff Cramer stating: "Somewhere, there is someone who has the answer that we have been looking for; maybe this will be the thing that will bring that person forward." &lt;ref name=PEC/&gt; The footage of this scene and the interview with Sheriff Cramer was later broadcast on television in the hope fresh leads toward establishing the identity of the child would ensue, although the program brought no significant new information.&lt;ref name=screen/&gt;

Despite the numerous and extensive local and national efforts conducted to identify the decedent, all contemporary efforts to either identify the child, or trace any of her relatives, failed.&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt;

==Funeral==
The funeral of this unidentified child was conducted on August 10, 1960. She was laid to rest in Mountain View Cemetery, with the campaign for funds to provide a dignified burial—as opposed to anonymous interment inside a [[pauper's grave]]—being spearheaded by a local radio announcer named Dave Palladin,&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; who successfully initiated a fundraising and donations appeal to local businesses, funeral homes and residents to ensure the child received a respectful burial. Palladin referred to his primary motivation for this fundraising campaign as being that he found the thought of a "little girl buried in [[Boot Hill]]"&lt;ref name=milwaukee&gt;{{cite news|title="Little Miss Nobody" Buried as Somebody|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=March 2, 1961|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19610302&amp;id=L29QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2034,505900&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an insufferable one, adding of his insistence the child received a decent [[Christian burial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clue to 'Little Miss Nobody' Still Sought |date=November 4, 1960 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19601104&amp;id=BhxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6557,190483 |publisher=Prescott Evening Courier |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her funeral, the child had become colloquially known within and around Yavapai County as "Little Miss Nobody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 1960 Cold Case: 'Little Miss Nobody' |date=March 25, 2018 |url=https://www.prescottenews.com/index.php/news/current-news/item/31703-1960-cold-case-little-miss-nobody |publisher=Prescott News |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maris Bustamante''' (born November 10, 1949) is a Mexican interdisciplinary artist who has presented her work in 21 solo exhibitions and over 400 group shows in Mexico and internationally. She has conceived, written, produced and executed more than 250 performances, installations, environments and two big “contraespectáculos” (anti-shows). She has presented performance art pieces through television broadcasts, which she called "social performances" involving the non-arts public. She also designs sets, costumes, and props for theatre, television, and cinema.

== Education ==
She studied at Escuela Nacional de Pintura Y Escultura "La Esmeralda," one of the two top art schools in Mexico, from 1968 to 1973.&lt;ref name="The Banff Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maris Bustamante|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca/faculty/faculty-member/2007/maris-bustamante/|website=The Banff Center|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archivo Virtual de Artes Escénicas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maris Bustamante (México - 1949 )|url=http://artesescenicas.uclm.es/index.php?sec=artis&amp;id=54|website=Archivo Virtual de Artes Escénicas|accessdate=7 March 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artwork and performance ==
In the 1970s, she began working as a conceptual artist, participating in the Groups ("Los Grupos") Movement in México City. She worked with the group [[NO GRUPO]] since its founding in 1979, until its dissolution six years later. SInce producing her first happening in 1971, she has researched non-traditional narratives.&lt;ref name="Archivo Virtual de Artes Escénicas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Banff Center" /&gt;

From 1977 to 1983, No Grupo staged several performances each year. In 1979, Bustamante spearheaded their extremely satirical ''Patente del Taco'' (1984'')''. The piece primarily consisted of Bustamante’s application for and reception of a patent for the taco, an indigenous Mexican food. The taco and patent were photographed in erotic ways, with the food arranged vertically and decorated with slogans such as “Atrévase a cometer un acto erótico cómase un taco” (commit an erotic act: eat a taco). The images were then blown up to a cartoonish side to symbolize the inflated role of machismo in Mexican culture.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, Edward J. ''Art and Social Movements: Cultural Politics in Mexico and Aztaln.'' Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, with [[Mónica Mayer]], she founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, [[Polvo de Gallina Negra]] (Black Hen Powder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polvo de Gallina Negra on pintomiraya.com|url=http://www.pintomiraya.com/pmr/gallina-negra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bustamante and Mayer's work combined radical social criticism and humour, exemplified by the group’s name: “Black Hen Powder – to protect us from the patriarchal magic which makes women disappear.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Re.Act.Feminism|publisher=Live Art Development Agency - Verlag fur Modern Kunst|isbn=978-3-86984-460-2|pages=290|url=http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/publishing/reactfeminism-2-a-performing-archive/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambaugh|first1=Antonio Prieto|title=Holy Terrors: Latin American Women Perform|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3240-X|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5gIK7DPAzMC&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Maris%20Bustamante&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Wrestling the Phallus, Resisting Amnesia: The Body Politics of Chilanga Performance Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one performance, ¡MADRES! (1984), Bustamante and Mayer became pregnant at the same time so they could experience the conditions of pregnancy in Mexico. One element of the performance was a television series on Canal 2 de Televisa Mexico called “Mother for a Day,” in which Bustamante and Mayer “impregnated” famous men like anchorman Guillermo Ochoa (1987). A key discussion topic on the show was domestic life, with a focus on the massive amount of labor that goes into motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn Museum. ''Brooklyn Museum: Monica P. Mayer.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/monica-p-mayer&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed February 10, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, Edward J.

The '''Neville–Neville feud''' was an inheritance dispute which took place in the [[north of England]] during the early [[15th century|fifteenth century]] between two branches of the [[House of Neville|Neville family]]. The inheritance in question was that of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]], a prominent northern nobleman who had issue from two marriages. Westmorland favoured as his [[heir]]s the children of his second wife, [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]], closely related to the royal family, over those of his first wife, [[Margaret de Stafford|Margaret Stafford]].

After Ralph Neville's death in 1425, many of the Neville family holdings were transferred through legal means to the children of Joan Beaufort (the Middleham [[cadet branch]] of the Neville family), in effect disinheriting the senior branch (the Nevilles of Raby). This led to more than a decade of rivalry between both branches of the family. Ralph Neville's eldest son, [[John Neville (d.1420)|John Neville]], had died before his father. John Neville's son, also named [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Ralph]], became the 2nd [[earl of Westmorland]]. Though the title earl of Westmorland passed to the senior Nevilles, for legal reasons, many holdings, particularly those of the Neville patrimony in [[History of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] and [[Raby Castle]] in [[County Durham|Durham]] were transferred to Joan and her children. The [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] Nevilles were also able to consolidate their control over the [[County Palatine of Durham]] after [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]] assumed the office of [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1437.

The senior branch disputed their disinheritance — both legally and by force of arms — but Joan Beaufort's eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville]], prevailed due to his family's greater political connections. The feud continued through the 1430s, until an agreement was reached in 1443. This settlement was largely favourable to Salisbury, and both branches of the family remained at odds with each other. The dispute between the senior and junior branches of the Neville family continued into the [[Wars of the Roses]]. During the prolonged civil war, the senior branch sided with the Lancastrians, while their cousins sided with the Yorkists. Margaret Stafford's grandsons gave Salisbury no support during the conflict and he was captured fighting for [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]]. Rather than being ransomed according to the usual custom of the time, Salisbury was beheaded by the common people "who loved him not."

==Background and causes==
[[File:Neville Inheritance.png|thumb|Neville holdings in [[Yorkshire]], [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]], [[Westmorland]] and [[County Durham|Durham]] in the 15th c.]]
Disputes over divided inheritances were not uncommon in [[Later Middle Ages|later medieval England]]; apart from the dispute between branches of the Neville family, there were similar disputes within the [[Baron Talbot|Talbot]] and [[Mountford family|Mountford]] families. Historian [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] described these three disputes, where property was transferred from a senior line to a junior line, as "particularly large scale and high profile".{{sfn|Hicks|2002|p=177}}

Ralph Neville, the 1st earl of Westmorland (c. 1364–1425) married twice. His first wife Margaret Stafford, daughter of the [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford|earl of Stafford]], died in 1396.{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} Shortly after her death, Ralph Neville married Joan Beaufort, daughter of [[John of Gaunt]] and cousin of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]].{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=266}} They had 9 sons and 5 daughters together: the eldest, Richard Neville, became [[earl of Salisbury]]; their second son, [[William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent|William Neville]], became [[earl of Kent]] and was created [[Baron Fauconberg]]; [[George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer|George Neville]] became the 1st [[Baron Latimer]], [[Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny|Edward Neville]] was [[Baron Abergavenny]] and their youngest, [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]], eventually assumed the office of Bishop of Durham.{{sfn|Commire|2000a}}{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} Historian [[Anthony Tuck]] writes that this marriage "was to have major consequences both for the Neville family and for the English nobility" throughout the 15th century.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} 

Neville's new proximity to the royal family through his marriage to the Richard II's cousin, and his loyalty to the Crown during the [[Richard II of England#Second crisis of 1397.E2.80.9399|crisis of July 1397]], led to his elevation to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]] as [[earl of Westmorland]] in 1397.{{sfn|Brown|2015|p=116}}{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=173}} Joan and Ralph were granted numerous offices, lands, wardships and pensions. They continued to enjoy royal favour until the death of King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1413.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=320}} 

The Neville patrimony included lands in [[Yorkshire]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Cumberland]].{{sfn|Arvanigian|2004|p=28}} After marrying Joan Beaufort, Ralph Neville began the process of disinheriting the children from his first marriage through a legal process called [[enfeoffment]]. The earl's eldest son [[John Neville (d.1420)|John Neville]], had previously agreed to a settlement in which he would inherit only [[Raby Castle]] and [[Brancepeth Castle]] in Durham.{{sfn|Bicheno|2017|loc=ch. 8}} This transfer of property to the cadet branch resulted in the "virtual disinheritance" of the senior branch of the family.{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} It was done legally and left the senior Nevilles with no legal recourse.{{sfn|Hicks|1991a|p=323}} [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]] has noted that the earl's eldest son does not seem to have attempted to stop his father or prevent his son's disinheritance, but may even have assisted with some of the transfers.{{sfn|Ross|1950}} 

This process of transfer of property, the so-called "Neville trust" or "Neville-Beaufort trust", had as its architect [[William Gascoigne]], one of the crown's most prominent lawyers. This might reflect an interest of the crown in retaining the Neville lands with Beaufort descendants, who would be closely related to the royal family due to their shared Lancastrian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reputation and Representation in Fifteenth-Century Europe|last=Biggs|first=Douglas L.|last2=Michalove|first2=Sharon D.|last3=Reeves|first3=Albert Compton|year=2004|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Henry V: New Interpretations|last=Dodd|first=Gwilym|year=2013|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of the dispute==
[[File:Ralph Neville.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.60|Drawing of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]]{{'}}s tomb]]

When Ralph Neville died in 1425, the title earl of Westmorland passed to his eldest grandson Ralph "[[fee tail|in tail male]]",{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} but neither of his sons by Margaret Stafford were mentioned in his will.{{sfn|Petre|1979|p=423}} Joan immediately took possession of [[Middleham Castle]], [[Penrith Castle]] and [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] for her eldest son.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=535}} She also held [[Raby Castle]] in Durham as part of her [[dower]] until her death in 1440.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|pp=590–591}} Historian J. R. Lander has written that the second earl of Westmorland was as "poor in land as an Earl as his father had been in early life as a baron."{{sfn|Lander|1980|p=177}} 

Only some estates in [[Brancepeth]], [[History of Northumberland|Northumberland]], Lincolnshire, two inns in London and [[History of Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Bywell Castle]] and property in [[Ripon]] were left for the senior Neville inheritance.{{sfn|Lewis|2015|loc=ch. 4}} The vast Yorkshire properties of [[Middleham Castle]], [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] and [[Wensleydale]] all went to Richard Neville,{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|pp=590–591}} who also became Warden of the West March when he inherited the [[Honour of Penrith]] in [[Cumberland]].{{sfn|Bicheno|2017|loc=ch. 8}} {{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} His wife, 15-year-old [[Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury|Alice Montagu]], was the sole heir of the [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury|late Earl of Salisbury]],{{sfn|Commire|2000b}} so Richard also inherited the title [[earl of Salisbury]] in 1428 when his father-in-law was killed in the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=217}} 

Westmorland spent much of life trying to recover the properties at Middleham, Sheriff Hutton, Penrith and Raby, but he was largely unsuccessful, because Joan Beaufort had powerful allies amongst the nobility including [[Thomas Langley]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], and her brother [[Cardinal Beaufort]].{{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} Langley withheld the [[patronage]] of the [[county palatine]] from the second earl, and denied him any available official offices or positions under the bishop's grant.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} Westmorland entered into recognisances with the Beaufort-Nevilles in 1430, after Salisbury brought the matter before the King's council.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=322}} When Salisbury departed for the Hundred Years' War in 1431 and again in 1436, Westmorland was once again [[bound over]] to keep the King's peace.{{sfn|Pollard|2004b}} However, in 1435, complaints from the North reached the [[Lord Chancellor]] that the dispute between the elder and junior branches of the Neville family had resulted in the assembling "by manner of war and insurrection, great routs and companies upon the field, which have done all manner of great offences".{{sfn|Baldwin|2011|loc=ch. 1}}

When the Bishop of Durham died in 1437, [[Cardinal Beaufort]] used his influence on the king's council to help Joan's younger son [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]] become the new Bishop. The [[House of Beaufort]] was able to gradually consolidate its control over the holding.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} By 1441, Salisbury's younger brother Lord Fauconberg was steward and military commander of Durham.{{sfn|Pollard|2004c}} There were a number of attempts to arbitrate a settlement in council, and between 1441 and 1443 both parties were constrained by bonds not to enter each other's estates except with permission. Historian [[R. L. Storey]] has questioned—with Salisbury being such a significant member of the council—whether Westmorland ever had "much faith in its impartiality".{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=113}}

==Aftermath and consequences==

[[File:Middleham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 610849.jpg|thumb|[[Middleham Castle]], seat of [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland]] and later her son the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]].]]
A peace was finally agreed between Salisbury and Westmorland on 26 August 1443.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=323}} Pollard writes that the "settlement" signified a "crushing defeat" for Ralph II {{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} and that the "odds had been heavily stacked" against him from the start.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=14}} True, he was confirmed in his right to the Lordship of [[Raby Castle]], but had to surrender everything else he had previously claimed from Salisbury back to him. He was also placed in bonds of £400 to keep to the agreement in the future, not just to Salisbury, but to his four brothers as well.{{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} Westmorland had to renounce all claims to the Neville lands in [[County Durham]], and had to pay annual rents to Salisbury for various Northumberland manors.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=323}} Salisbury was not subject to similar constraints, merely having to agree to not claim the £400 pension while Westmorland adhered to their agreement.{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=186}}

[[J.R. Lander]] described the Neville–Neville feud as illustrating how the Neville family "never could and never did work together".{{sfn|Lander|1986|p=32}} The dispute between the senior and junior branches of the Neville family continued into the Wars of the Roses.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=174}} During the prolonged conflict that ravaged the English nobility, Westmorland gave his half-brother no support at all; in fact Westmorland's younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|Lord John Neville]] died fighting for the Lancastrian [[King Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] at the [[Battle of Towton]] in 1461.{{sfn|Griffiths|1991|p=342}} Salisbury himself was captured at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and instead of being ransomed, he was beheaded by the common people, who "loved him not."{{sfn|Haigh|2001}} Lander also suggested that if had been united as a family behind Salisbury, who supported [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] during the Wars of the Roses, York's "power in the land would have been overwhelming".{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=177}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8458">'''Nonresistance''' (or '''non-resistance''') is "the practice or principle of not resisting authority, even when it is unjustly exercised".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, accessed 8 April 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; At its core is discouragement of, even opposition to, physical resistance to an enemy. It is considered as a form of principled [[nonviolence]] or [[pacifism]] which rejects all physical violence, whether exercised on individual, group, state or international levels. Practitioners of nonresistance may refuse to retaliate against an opponent or offer any form of [[self-defense]]. Nonresistance is often associated with particular religious groups.

Sometimes non-resistance has been seen as compatible with, even part of, movements advocating [[social change]]. An often-cited example is the movement led by [[Mohandas Gandhi]] in the struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian Independence]]. While it is true that in particular instances (e.g. when threatened with arrest) practitioners in such movements might follow the line of non-resistance, such movements are more accurately described as cases of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]].

==History==

Perhaps the oldest recorded statement of nonresistance philosophy is that of [[Socrates]] around 399 BC.  An influential [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] philosopher, Socrates was [[Trial of Socrates|sentenced to death]] by the [[Athenian democracy]] for teaching his students to question authority and think for themselves.  Socrates [[Crito|accepted his fate]] on reasons of morality and justice, rather than accept help from his supporters to flee [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and escape execution.

The term nonresistance was later used to refer to the [[Established Church]] during the religious troubles in [[England]] following the [[English Civil War]] and [[Act of Settlement 1701|Protestant Succession]]. In the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist churches]], the term is defined in contrast with [[pacifism]]. Advocates of non-resistance view pacifism as a more liberal theology since it advocates only physical nonviolence and allows its followers to actively oppose an enemy. In the 20th century, there have been differences of opinion between and within [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] churches, as they disagreed on the ethics of nonresistance and pacifism.

[[Leo Tolstoy]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Leo. The Kingdom of God is within you. 1893. [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You/Chapter_I], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adin Ballou]]&lt;ref&gt;Ballou, Adin. Christian Non-Resistance in all its important bearings, illustrated and defended (1846). Providence; Blackstones Ed., 2003, 190 pp. [https://archive.org/details/ChristianNon-resistance]; Ballou, Adin. Christian non-resistance in extreme cases. 1860. [http://www.adinballou.org/extreme.shtml]; Ballou, Adin. Non-Resistance in relation to human governments. [https://archive.org/details/Non-resistanceInRelationToHumanGovernments], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] were notable advocates of nonresistance.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, there were variations between them. Gandhi's ''[[Satyagraha]]'' movement was based on a belief in resistance that was active but at the same time nonviolent, and he did not believe in using non-resistance (or even nonviolent resistance) in circumstances where a failure to oppose an adversary effectively amounted to cowardice. 'I do believe,' he wrote, 'that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.'"&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section “Between Cowardice and Violence,” of the book The Mind of Mohandas Gandhi, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian theology==
[[Christian]] nonresistance is based on a reading of the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which [[Jesus]] says:

{{quote|You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, [[Turning the other cheek|turn to him the other also]]. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.|[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:38-42, NIV}}

Members of the [[Anabaptist]] ([[Mennonite]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]] and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]/[[German Baptist]]) denominations and other [[peace church]]es like the [[Quaker]]s have interpreted this passage to mean that people should do nothing to physically resist an enemy. According to this belief, only [[God]] has the right to execute punishments. Nonresistant Christians note that [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] love of Jesus resulted in his submission to [[crucifixion]] rather than vengeance. A main application of this theology for Anabaptist groups is to teach [[conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] of military [[conscription]] to their youth.

To illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, [[Alexandre Christoyannopoulos]] offers the following [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] response to [[terrorism]]:

{{Quote|The path shown by Jesus is a difficult one that can only be trod by true martyrs. A "[[martyr]]," etymologically, is he who makes himself a witness to his faith. And it is the ultimate testimony to one’s faith to be ready to put it to practice even when one’s very life is threatened. But the life to be sacrificed, it should be noted, is not the enemy’s life, but the martyr’s own life — killing others is not a testimony of love, but of anger, fear, or hatred. For Tolstoy, therefore, a true martyr to Jesus’ message would neither punish nor resist (or at least not use violence to resist), but would strive to act from love, however hard, whatever the likelihood of being crucified. He would patiently learn to forgive and turn the other cheek, even at the risk of death. Such would be the only way to eventually win the hearts and minds of the other camp and open up the possibilities for reconciliation in the "[[War on Terror|war on terror]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/6673/1/Christo%203.pdf |title=Turning the Other Cheek to Terrorism: Reflections on the Contemporary Significance of Leo Tolstoy's Exegesis of the Sermon on the Mount |pages=41–42 |date= April 2008 |publisher=Loughborough University Institutional Repository }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Peace education''' is the process of acquiring the ''values'', the ''knowledge'' and developing the ''attitudes, skills, and behaviors'' to live in harmony with oneself, with others, and with the natural environment.

There are numerous [[United Nations]] declarations on the importance of peace education.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''.

Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Peace education as a right is something which is now increasingly emphasized by peace researchers such as [[Betty Reardon]]&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Betty.

== Definition ==

Ian Harris and John Synott have described peace education as a series of "teaching encounters" that draw from people:&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ian and Synott, John. (2002) 'Peace Education for a New Century' ''Social Alternatives'' 21(1):3-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*their desire for peace,
*nonviolent alternatives for managing conflict, and
*skills for critical analysis of structural arrangements that produce and legitimize [[social injustice|injustice]] and [[social inequality|inequality]].
[[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] suggests peace education be thought of as "encouraging a commitment to peace as a settled disposition and enhancing the confidence of the individual as an individual agent of peace; as informing the student on the consequences of war and social injustice; as informing the student on the value of peaceful and just social structures and working to uphold or develop such social structures; as encouraging the student to love the world and to imagine a peaceful future; and as caring for the student and encouraging the student to care for others".&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the theory or philosophy of peace education has been assumed and not articulated. [[Johan Galtung]] suggested in 1975 that no theory for peace education existed and that there was clearly an urgent need for [[peace and conflict studies|such theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan (1975) ''Essays in Peace Research, Volume 1''. Copenhagen: Eljers. pp. 334-339.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been attempts to establish such a theory. Joachim James Calleja has suggested  that a philosophical basis for peace education might be located in the [[categorical imperative|Kantian notion of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Calleja, Joachim James (1991) 'A Kantian Epistemology of Education and Peace: An Examination of Concepts and Values'. Unpublishd PhD Thesis. Bradford University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] has suggested that a rationale for peace education might be located in virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, conservative [[political ethics]], aesthetic ethics and the ethics of care.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early decades of the 20th century, "peace education" programs around the world have represented a spectrum of focal themes, including [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclearism]], international understanding, environmental responsibility, communication skills, [[nonviolence]], conflict resolution techniques, democracy, human rights awareness, tolerance of diversity, coexistence and [[gender equality]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See Groff, L., and Smoker, P. (1996). Creating global-local cultures of peace. Peace and Conflict
Studies Journal, 3, (June); Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal
(Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-
Bass Publishers; Johnson, M.L. (1998). Trends in peace education. ERIC Digest. ED417123; Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. “Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being”. Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2011}} have also addressed spiritual dimensions of inner harmony, or synthesized a number of the foregoing issues into programs on world citizenship. While academic discourse on the subject has increasingly recognized the need for a broader, more holistic approach to peace education, a review of field-based projects reveals that three variations of peace education are most common: conflict resolution training, democracy education, and [[human rights education]]. New approaches are emerging and calling into question some of theoretical foundations of the models just mentioned. The most significant of these new approaches focuses on peace education as a process of worldview transformation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Forms==

===Conflict resolution training===
Peace education programs centered on conflict resolution typically focus on the social-behavioural symptoms of conflict, training individuals to resolve inter-personal disputes through techniques of negotiation and (peer) mediation. Learning to manage anger, "fight fair" and improve communication through skills such as listening, turn-taking, identifying needs, and separating facts from emotions, constitute the main elements of these programs. Participants are also encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to brainstorm together on compromises&lt;ref&gt;See Deutsch, M. (1993). Educating for a peaceful world. American Psychologist, 48, 510-517; Hakvoort, I. and Oppenheimer, L. (1993). Children and adolescents' conceptions of peace, war, and strategies to attain peace: A Dutch case study. Journal of Peace Research, 30, 65-77; Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, approaches of this type aim to "alter beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours...from negative to positive attitudes toward conflict as a basis for preventing violence" (Van Slyck, Stern and Elbedour, 1999, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Van Slyck, M.R., Stern, M., and Elbedour, S. (1999). Adolescents' beliefs about their conflict behaviour. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 208-230). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training ([[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]], [[Verbal Aikido]], [[Non-violent communication|NVC]]) that can give the practitioner the means to accept the conflictual situation and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: "Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can't go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, R. Examining barriers to effective peace education reform. Contemporary Education, 71, 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy education===
Peace education programs centered on democracy education typically focus on the political processes associated with conflict, and postulate that with an increase in democratic participation the likelihood of societies resolving conflict through violence
and war decreases. At the same time, "a democratic society needs the commitment of citizens who accept the inevitability of conflict as well as the necessity for tolerance" (U.S. Department of State, The Culture of Democracy, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. (n.d.). The culture of democracy. Retrieved January 13, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus programs of this kind attempt to foster a conflict-positive orientation in the community by training students to view conflict as a platform for creativity and growth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type train participants in the skills of [[critical thinking]], debate and coalition-building, and promote the values of freedom of speech, individuality, [[toleration|tolerance]] of [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], compromise and [[conscientious objection]]. Their aim is to produce "responsible citizens" who will hold their governments accountable to the standards of peace, primarily through adversarial processes. Activities are structured to have students "assume the role of the citizen that chooses, makes decisions, takes positions, argues positions and respects the opinions of others":&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from CIVITAS BiH, a program of democracy and human rights education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
http://www.civitas.ba/nastavni_planovi/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; skills that a multi-party democracy are
based upon. Based on the assumption that democracy decreases the likelihood of violence and war, it is assumed that these are the same skills necessary for creating a culture of peace.

===Human rights education===
Peace education programs centered on raising [[awareness]] of [[human rights]] typically focus at the level of policies that humanity ought to adopt in order to move closer to a peaceful global community. The aim is to engender a commitment among participants to a vision of structural peace in which all individual members of the human race can exercise their personal freedoms and be legally protected from violence, oppression and indignity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type familiarize participants with the international covenants and declarations of the United Nations system; train students to recognize violations of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; and promote tolerance, solidarity, autonomy and self-affirmation at the individual and collective levels.&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, K. (2001). Justification for and implementation of peace education. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 7, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights education "faces continual elaboration, a significant theory-practice gap and frequent challenge as to its validity".&lt;ref&gt;Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. "Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being". Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In one practitioner's view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Human rights education does not work in communities fraught with conflict unless it is part of a comprehensive approach... In fact, such education can be counterproductive and lead to greater conflict if people become aware of rights which are not realized. In this respect, human rights education can increase the potential for conflict"''&lt;ref&gt;Parlevliet, M. (n.d.). Quoted in Pitts, D. (2002). Human rights education in diverse, developing nations: A case in point – South Africa. Issues of Democracy, 7 (March). Retrieved January 12, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0302/ijde/pitts1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To prevent these outcomes, many such programs are now being combined with aspects of conflict resolution and democracy education schools of thought, along with training in nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Kester. 2008. Developing peace education programs: Beyond ethnocentrism and violence. Peace Prints, 1(1), 37-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldview transformation===
Some approaches to peace education start from insights gleaned from psychology which recognize the developmental nature of human psychosocial dispositions. Essentially, while conflict-promoting attitudes and behaviours are characteristic of earlier phases of human development, unity-promoting attitudes and behaviours emerge in later phases of healthy development. H.B. Danesh (2002a, 2002b, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b)&lt;ref&gt;Danesh, H. B. (2006). Towards an integrative theory of peace education. Journal of Peace Education, 3(1), 55–78.

Peace and Conflict Studies, 11(2), 55–84.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes an "Integrative Theory of Peace" in which peace is understood as a psychosocial, political, moral and spiritual reality. Peace education, he says, must focus on the healthy development and maturation of human consciousness through assisting people to examine and transform their worldviews. Worldviews are defined as the subconscious lens (acquired through cultural, family, historical, religious and societal influences) through which people perceive four key issues: 1) the nature of reality, 2) human nature, 3) the purpose of existence, 4) the principles governing appropriate human relationships. Surveying a mass of material, Danesh argues that the majority of people and societies in the world hold conflict-based worldviews, which express themselves in conflicted intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, and international relationships. He subdivides conflict-based worldviews into two main categories which he correlates to phases of human development: the Survival-Based Worldview and the Identity-Based Worldview. It is through the acquisition of a more integrative, Unity-Based Worldview that human capacity to mitigate conflict, create unity in the context of diversity, and establish sustainable cultures of peace, is increased—be it in the home, at school, at work, or in the international community.

===Critical peace education===
Modern forms of peace education relate to new scholarly explorations and applications of techniques used in peace education internationally, in plural communities and with individuals. Critical Peace Education (Bajaj 2008, 2015; Bajaj &amp; Hantzopoulos 2016; Trifonas &amp; Wright 2013) is an emancipatory pursuit that seeks to link education to the goals and foci of social justice disrupting inequality through critical pedagogy (Freire 2003). Critical peace education addresses the critique that peace education is imperial and impository mimicking the 'interventionism' of Western peacebuilding by foregrounding local practices and narratives into peace education (Salomon 2004; MacGinty &amp; Richmond 2007; Golding 2017). The project of critical peace education includes conceiving of education as a space of transformation where students and teachers become change agents that recognise past and present experiences of inequity and bias and where schools become strategic sites for fostering emancipatory change.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2004). "Comment: what is peace education?" Journal of Peace Education, 1:1, 123-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty, R. &amp; Richmond, O. (2007). "Myth or Reality: Opposing Views on the Liberal Peace and Post-War Reconstruction,", Global Society 21: 491-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golding, D. (2017). "Border Cosmopolitanism in Critical Peace Education,", Journal of Peace Education 14(2): 155-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2008). Encyclopedia of Peace Education. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2015). 'Pedagogies of Resistance' and critical peace education praxis. Journal of Peace Education 12(2): 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. &amp; Hantzopooulos, M. (Eds) (2016). Introduction: Theory, Research, and Praxis of Peace Education in Peace Education: International Perspectives. New York: Bloomsbury (1-16).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trifonas, P. P. &amp; Wright, B. (2013). "Introduction," in Critical Peace Education: Difficult Dialogues. New York: Springer, (xiii-xx).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Yogic peace education===
Where Critical Peace Education is emancipatory, seeking to foster full humanity in society for everyone, yogic peace education (Standish &amp; Joyce 2017)&lt;ref&gt;Standish, K. &amp; Joyce, J (2017). (Forthcoming) Yogic Peace Education: Theory and Practice. Jefferson: McFarland and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; in concerned with transforming personal (as opposed to interpersonal, structural or societal/cultural) violence. In yogic peace education, techniques from yogic science are utilised to alter the physical, mental and spiritual instrument of humanity (the self) to address violence that comes from within. Contemporary peace education (similar to all peace education) relate to specific forms of violence (and their transformation) and similar to teaching human rights and conflict resolution in schools critical peace education and yogic peace education are complementary curricula that seek to foster positive peace and decrease violence in society.

== Criticism ==
Toh Swee-Hin (1997) observes that each of the various streams of peace education "inevitably have their own dynamics and 'autonomy' in terms of theory and practice". "Salomon (2002) has described how the challenges, goals, and methods of peace education differ substantially between areas characterized by intractable conflict, interethnic tension, or relative tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2002). "The Nature of Peace Education: Not All Programs Are Created Equal" in G. Salomon and B. Nevo (eds.) Peace education: The concept, principles and practices in the world. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Quoted in Nelson, Linden L. (2000). "Peace Education from a Psychological Perspective: Contributions of the Peace and Education Working Group of the American Psychological Association Div. 48."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon (2002) raises the problem and its consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Imagine that medical practitioners would not distinguish between invasive surgery to remove malignant tumors and surgery to correct one's vision. Imagine also that while surgeries are practiced, no research and no evaluation of their differential effectiveness accompany them. The field would be considered neither very serious nor very trustworthy. Luckily enough, such a
state of affairs does not describe the field of medicine, but it comes pretty close to describing the field of peace education. First, too many profoundly different kinds of activities taking place in an exceedingly wide array of contexts are all lumped under the same category label of "peace education" as if they belong together. Second, for whatever reason, the field's scholarship in the form of theorizing, research and program evaluation badly lags behind practice… In the absence of clarity of what peace education really is, or how its different varieties relate to each other, it is unclear how experience with one variant of peace education in one region can usefully inform programs in another region."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Clarke-Habibi (2005), "A general or integrated theory of peace is needed: one that can holistically account for the intrapersonal, inter-personal, inter-group and international dynamics of peace, as well as its main principles and pre-requisites. An essential component of this integrated theory must also be the recognition that a culture of peace can only result from an authentic process of transformation, both individual and collective."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke-Habibi, Sara. (2005) "Transforming Worldviews: The Case of Education for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina". Journal of Transformative Education, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 33-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''plane''' is a flat, two-[[dimension]]al [[surface (topology)|surface]] that extends infinitely far. A plane is the [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional analogue]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] (zero dimensions), a [[line (geometry)|line]] (one dimension) and [[three-dimensional space]]. Planes can arise as subspaces of some higher-dimensional space, as with a room's walls extended infinitely far, or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right, as in the setting of [[Euclidean geometry]].

When working exclusively in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the definite article is used, so, ''the'' plane refers to the whole space. Many fundamental tasks in mathematics, [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[graph theory]], and [[graph of a function|graphing]] are performed in a two-dimensional space, or, in other words, in the plane.

==Euclidean geometry==
{{Main|Euclidean geometry}}

[[Euclid]] set forth the first great landmark of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc= pg. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected a small core of undefined terms (called ''common notions'') and postulates (or [[axiom]]s) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the ''Elements'', it may be thought of as part of the common notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate= 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. In this way the Euclidean plane is not quite the same as the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] plane.
&lt;!--In higher-dimensional Euclidean space, a plane inside this space can be uniquely determined by any of the following sets of objects:

*three [[non-collinear points]] (i.e. not lying on the same [[line (mathematics)|line]])
*a line and a point not on the line
*two distinct intersecting lines --&gt;

[[File:Planes parallel.svg|thumb|right|150px|Three parallel planes.]]
&lt;!--In 3 dimensional Euclidean space, planes, like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, can be [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or intersecting. Lines drawn on two parallel planes will either be parallel or [[skew lines|skew]] but will not intersect. Intersecting planes may be [[perpendicular]] or may form any number of other angles. In Euclidean spaces of more than 3 dimensions, it is possible to have two planes that intersect in a single point.--&gt;

A plane is a [[ruled surface]].

==Planes embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space==
This section is solely concerned with planes embedded in three dimensions: specifically, in [[Cartesian product|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]].

===Determination by contained points and lines===
In a Euclidean space of any number of dimensions, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following:
*Three non-[[collinear]] points (points not on a single line).
*A line and a point not on that line.
*Two distinct but intersecting lines.
*Two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.

===Properties===
The following statements hold in three-dimensional Euclidean space but not in higher dimensions, though they have higher-dimensional analogues:

*Two distinct planes are either parallel or they intersect in a [[line (geometry)|line]].
*A line is either parallel to a plane, intersects it at a single point, or is contained in the plane.
*Two distinct lines [[perpendicular]] to the same plane must be parallel to each other.
*Two distinct planes perpendicular to the same line must be parallel to each other.

===Point-normal form and general form of the equation of a plane===
In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the [[normal vector]]) to indicate its "inclination".

Specifically, let {{math|'''''r'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the position vector of some point {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and let {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by the point {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the vector {{mvar|'''n'''}} consists of those points {{math|''P''}}, with position vector {{mvar|'''r'''}}, such that the vector drawn from {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''P''}} is perpendicular to {{mvar|'''n'''}}. Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points {{mvar|'''r'''}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
(The dot here means a [[dot product|dot (scalar) product]].)
Expanded this becomes
:&lt;math&gt; a (x-x_0)+ b(y-y_0)+ c(z-z_0)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the ''point-normal'' form of the equation of a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is just a [[linear equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; d = -(ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0).&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, it is easily shown that if {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} and {{math|''d''}} are constants and {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are not all zero, then the graph of the equation
::&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
is a plane having the vector {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} as a normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This familiar equation for a plane is called the ''general form'' of the equation of the plane.&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus for example a [[regression equation]] of the form {{math|1=''y'' = ''d'' + ''ax'' + ''cz''}} (with {{math|1=''b'' = −1}}) establishes a best-fit plane in three-dimensional space when there are two explanatory variables.

===Describing a plane with a point and two vectors lying on it===
Alternatively, a plane may be described parametrically as the set of all points of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf {r}_0 + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:PlaneR.jpg|thumb|Vector description of a plane]]
where ''s'' and ''t'' range over all real numbers, '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} are given [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] defining the plane, and {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the vector representing the position of an arbitrary (but fixed) point on the plane. The vectors '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be visualized as vectors starting at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and pointing in different directions along the plane. Note that '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be [[perpendicular]], but cannot be parallel.

===Describing a plane through three points===
Let {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be non-collinear points.

====Method 1====
The plane passing through {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be described as the set of all points (x,y,z) that satisfy the following [[determinant]] equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x_2 - x_1 &amp; y_2 - y_1&amp; z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 &amp; y_3 - y_1 &amp; z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x - x_2 &amp; y - y_2 &amp; z - z_2 \\
x - x_3 &amp; y - y_3 &amp; z - z_3
\end{vmatrix} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====
To describe the plane by an equation of the form &lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, solve the following system of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_3 + by_3 + cz_3 + d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This system can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]] and basic matrix manipulations. Let
: &lt;math&gt;D = \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''D'' is non-zero (so for planes not through the origin) the values for ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
1 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
1 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; 1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; 1 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; 1 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; 1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; 1 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are parametric in ''d''. Setting ''d'' equal to any non-zero number and substituting it into these equations will yield one solution set.

====Method 3====
This plane can also be described by the "[[plane_(geometry)#Point-normal_form_and_general_form_of_the_equation_of_a_plane|point and a normal vector]]" prescription above. A suitable normal vector is given by the [[cross product]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf n = ( \mathbf p_2 - \mathbf p_1 ) \times ( \mathbf p_3 - \mathbf p_1 ), &lt;/math&gt;
and the point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be taken to be any of the given points {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}},{{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref name=PaulsPlanes&gt;{{citation
|last= Dawkins
|first= Paul
|title= Calculus III
|chapter= Equations of Planes
|chapterurl= http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/EqnsOfPlanes.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or any other point in the plane).

===Distance from a point to a plane===
{{Main|Distance from a point to a plane}}
For a plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi : ax + by + cz + d = 0&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1 = (x_1,y_1,z_1) &lt;/math&gt; not necessarily lying on the plane, the shortest distance from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; to the plane is
:&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{\left | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d \right |}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; lies in the plane [[if and only if]] ''D=0''.

If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=1&lt;/math&gt; meaning that ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are normalized&lt;ref&gt;To normalize arbitrary coefficients, divide each of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}&lt;/math&gt; (which can not be 0). The "new" coefficients are now normalized and the following formula is valid for the "new" coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt; then the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; D = \ | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d |.&lt;/math&gt;

Another vector form for the equation of a plane, known as the [[Hesse normal form]] relies on the parameter ''D''. This form is:&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} - D_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit normal vector to the plane, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; a position vector of a point of the plane and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the distance of the plane from the origin.

The general formula for higher dimensions can be quickly arrived at using [[vector notation]]. Let the [[hyperplane]] have equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normal vector]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0 = (x_{10},x_{20},\dots,x_{N0})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[position vector]] to a point in the [[hyperplane]]. We desire the perpendicular distance to the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_{11},x_{21},\dots,x_{N1})&lt;/math&gt;. The [[hyperplane]] may also be represented by the scalar equation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N a_i x_i = -a_0&lt;/math&gt;, for constants &lt;math&gt;\{a_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, a corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; may be represented as &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2, \dots, a_N)&lt;/math&gt;. We desire the [[scalar projection]] of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Noting that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r}_0 = \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n} = -a_0&lt;/math&gt; (as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation of the [[hyperplane]]) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
D &amp;= \frac{|(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} + a_0|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|a_1x_{11} + a_2x_{21} + \dots + a_Nx_{N1} + a_0|}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_N^2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Line of intersection between two planes===
The line of intersection between two planes &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : \mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf r = h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : \mathbf {n}_2 \cdot \mathbf r = h_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_i&lt;/math&gt; are normalized is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {r} = (c_1 \mathbf {n}_1 + c_2 \mathbf {n}_2) + \lambda (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ h_1 - h_2(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ h_2 - h_1(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

This is found by noticing that the line must be perpendicular to both plane normals, and so parallel to their cross product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; (this cross product is zero if and only if the planes are parallel, and are therefore non-intersecting or entirely coincident).

The remainder of the expression is arrived at by finding an arbitrary point on the line. To do so, consider that any point in space may be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = c_1\mathbf {n}_1 + c_2\mathbf {n}_2 + \lambda(\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf {n}_1, \mathbf {n}_2, (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) \}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. We wish to find a point which is on both planes (i.e. on their intersection), so insert this equation into each of the equations of the planes to get two simultaneous equations which can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.

If we further assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[orthonormal]] then the closest point on the line of intersection to the origin is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_0 = h_1\mathbf {n}_1 + h_2\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt;. If that is not the case, then a more complex procedure must be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane-PlaneIntersection.html Plane-Plane Intersection - from Wolfram MathWorld]. Mathworld.wolfram.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dihedral angle===
{{See also|Dihedral angle}}
Given two intersecting planes described by &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z + d_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z + d_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[dihedral angle]] between them is defined to be the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between their normal directions:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha = \frac{\hat n_1\cdot \hat n_2}{|\hat n_1||\hat n_2|} = \frac{a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 + c_1 c_2}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2+c_1^2}\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2+c_2^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Planes in various areas of mathematics==
In addition to its familiar [[geometric]] structure, with [[isomorphism]]s that are [[isometry|isometries]] with respect to the usual inner product, the plane may be viewed at various other levels of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]]. Each level of abstraction corresponds to a specific [[category (mathematics)|category]].

At one extreme, all geometrical and [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] concepts may be dropped to leave the [[topological]] plane, which may be thought of as an idealized [[homotopy|homotopically]] trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct [[surface (topology)|surface]]s (or 2-manifolds) classified in [[low-dimensional topology]]. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[bijection]]s. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of [[graph theory]] that deals with [[planar graphs]], and results such as the [[four color theorem]].

The plane may also be viewed as an [[affine space]], whose isomorphisms are combinations of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but [[collinearity]] and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.

[[Differential geometry]] views a plane as a 2-dimensional real [[manifold]], a topological plane which is provided with a [[differential structure]]. Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but there is now a concept of smoothness of maps, for example a [[differentiable function|differentiable]] or [[smooth function|smooth]] path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.

In the opposite direction of abstraction, we may apply a compatible field structure to the geometric plane, giving rise to the [[complex plane]] and the major area of [[complex analysis]]. The complex field has only two isomorphisms that leave the real line fixed, the identity and [[complex conjugation|conjugation]].

In the same way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, one-dimensional (over the complex numbers) [[complex manifold]], sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all [[conformal map|conformal]] bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.

In addition, the Euclidean geometry (which has zero [[curvature]] everywhere) is not the only geometry that the plane may have. The plane may be given a [[spherical geometry]] by using the [[stereographic projection]]. This can be thought of as placing a sphere on the plane (just like a ball on the floor), removing the top point, and projecting the sphere onto the plane from this point). This is one of the projections that may be used in making a flat map of part of the Earth's surface. The resulting geometry has constant positive curvature.

Alternatively, the plane can also be given a metric which gives it constant negative curvature giving the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. The latter possibility finds an application in the theory of [[special relativity]] in the simplified case where there are two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. (The hyperbolic plane is a [[timelike]] [[hypersurface]] in three-dimensional [[Minkowski space]].)

==Topological and differential geometric notions==
The [[one-point compactification]] of the plane is homeomorphic to a [[sphere]] (see [[stereographic projection]]); the open disk is homeomorphic to a sphere with the "north pole" missing; adding that point completes the (compact) sphere. The result of this compactification is a [[manifold]] referred to as the [[Riemann sphere]] or the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[projective line]]. The projection from the Euclidean plane to a sphere without a point is a [[diffeomorphism]] and even a [[conformal map]].

The plane itself is homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to an open [[disk (mathematics)|disk]]. For the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.

'''Progress''' is the idea that advances in [[technology]], [[science]], and [[social organization]] can produce an improvement in the [[human condition]], and therefore that entire [[societies]], and humanity in general, can improve in terms of their social, political, and economic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;  This may happen as a result of direct human action, as in [[social enterprise]] or through [[activism]], or as a natural part of [[sociocultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, R., 2017. History of the Idea of Progress. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th century [[social theory|social theories]], especially [[social evolution]] as described by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. It was present in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]]. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

==Measuring progress==
Specific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.&lt;ref&gt;Slaboch, M.W., 2017. A Road to Nowhere: The Idea of Progress and Its Critics. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GDP]] growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the [[sustainability]] of economic activity. [[Wikiprogress]] has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. [http://www.humanprogress.org/ HumanProgress.org] is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.

The [[Social Progress Index]] is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.

Indices that can be used to measure progress include:
{{div col}}
* [[Broad measures of economic progress]]
* [[Disability-adjusted life year]]
* [[Green national product]]
* [[Gender-related Development Index]]
* [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]
* [[Gross National Happiness]]
* [[Gross National Well-being]]
* [[Happy Planet Index]]
* [[Human Development Index]]
* [[Legatum Prosperity Index]]
* [[Social Progress Index]]
* [[OECD Better Life Index]]
* [[Subjective life satisfaction]]
* [[Where-to-be-born Index]]
* [[Wikiprogress]]
* [[World Happiness Report]]
* [[World Values Survey]]
{{div col end}}

==Scientific progress==
{{see also|History of science|Technological change|Invention}}
'''Scientific progress''' is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of [[scientific knowledge]] to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wesseling|first=Henk|date=August 1998|title=History: Science or art?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/history-science-or-art/1D3620AE5FCD4AA371AC99E352260E68|journal=European Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–267|doi=10.1017/S106279870000329X|issn=1474-0575|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

This process differs from [[non-science]] fields, such as human languages or history:  the people who spoke a now-extinct language, or who lived through a historical time period, can be said to have known different things from the scholars who studied it later, but they cannot be said to know less about their lives than the modern scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some valid knowledge is lost through the passage of time, and other knowledge is gained, with the result that the non-science fields do not make scientific progress towards understanding their subject areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Aspects of social progress, as described by [[Condorcet]], have included the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
How progress improved the degraded status of women in traditional society was a major theme of historians starting in the Enlightenment and continuing to today.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Ann Taylor (1999). "Feminism, Social Science, and the Meanings of Modernity: the Debate on the Origin of the Family in Europe and the United States, 1860–914," ''American Historical Review'' '''104''' (4): 1085–113; Nyland, Chris (1993). "Adam Smith, Stage Theory, and the Status of Women," ''History of Political Economy'' '''25''' (4): 617–40.&lt;/ref&gt; British theorists [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] (1721–1793) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797), along with many of their contemporaries, remained committed to Christian- and [[republicanism|republican-based]] conceptions of virtue, while working within a new Enlightenment paradigm. The political agenda related beauty, taste, and morality to the imperatives and needs of modern societies of a high level of sophistication and differentiation. Two themes in the work of Robertson and Burke—the nature of women in 'savage' and 'civilized' societies and 'beauty in distress'—reveals how long-held convictions about the character of women, especially with regard to their capacity and right to appear in the public domain, were modified and adjusted to the idea of progress and became central to an enlightened affirmation of modern European civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Kontler, László (2004). "Beauty or Beast, or Monstrous Regiments? Robertson and Burke on Women and the Public Scene," ''Modern Intellectual History'' '''1''' (3): 305–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics experts have examined the status of women in the ancient world, concluding that in the Roman Empire, with its superior social organization, internal peace, and rule of law, allowed women to enjoy a somewhat better standing than in ancient Greece, where women were distinctly inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Robert William, &amp; Chris Nyland (2003). ''The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought''.Edward Elgar Publishing, p. 109; Ryrie, Charles Caldwell (1958). ''The Place of Women in the Church'', The Macmillan Company, Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status of women in traditional China has raised the issue of whether the idea of progress requires a thoroughgoing reject of traditionalism—a belief held by many Chinese reformers in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vernoff, Edward, &amp; Peter J. Seybolt, (2007). ''Through Chinese Eyes: Tradition, Revolution, and Transformation'', APEX Press, pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Leo Marx and [[Bruce Mazlish]] asking, "Should we in fact abandon the idea of progress as a view of the past," answer that there is no doubt "that the status of women has improved markedly" in cultures that have adopted the Enlightenment idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Leo, &amp; Bruce Mazlish (1998). ''Progress: Fact or Illusion?''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernization==
{{main|Modernization}}
Modernization was promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Joyce; Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob (1995). ''Telling the Truth about History''. W.W. Norton, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe [[social commentary|social commentators]] and [[philosopher]]s began to realize that people ''themselves'' could change society and change their way of life. Instead of being made completely by gods, there was increasing room for the idea that people themselves ''made their own society''—and not only that, as [[Giambattista Vico]] argued, ''because'' people made their own society, they could also fully comprehend it. This gave rise to new sciences, or [[proto-science]]s, which claimed to provide new scientific knowledge about what society was like, and how one may change it for the better.&lt;ref&gt;The following annotated reference list appears in [[J. B. Bury]]'s study: ''The Idea of Progress,'' published in 1920 and [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4557/4557-h/4557-h.htm available in full on the web]:
{{Quote|The history of the idea of Progress has been treated briefly and partially by various French writers; e.g. Comte, {{lang|fr|Cours de philosophie positive}}, vi. 321 sqq.; Buchez, {{lang|fr|Introduction a la science de l'histoire}}, i. 99 sqq. (ed. 2, 1842); Javary, {{lang|fr|De l'idee de progres}} (1850); Rigault, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}} (1856); Bouillier, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la philosophie cartesienne}} (1854); Caro, {{lang|fr|Problemes de la morale sociale}} (1876); Brunetiere, "{{lang|fr|La Formation de l'idee de progres|italic=no}}", in {{lang|fr|Etudes critiques}}, 5e serie. More recently M. Jules Delvaille has attempted to trace its history fully, down to the end of the eighteenth century. His {{lang|fr|Histoire de l'idee de progres}} (1910) is planned on a large scale; he is erudite and has read extensively. But his treatment is lacking in the power of discrimination. He strikes one as anxious to bring within his net, as {{lang|fr|theoriciens du progres}}, as many distinguished thinkers as possible; and so, along with a great deal that is useful and relevant, we also find in his book much that is irrelevant. He has not clearly seen that the distinctive idea of Progress was not conceived in antiquity or in the Middle Ages, or even in the Renaissance period; and when he comes to modern times he fails to bring out clearly the decisive steps of its growth. And he does not seem to realize that a man might be "progressive" without believing in, or even thinking about, the doctrine of Progress. Leonardo da Vinci and Berkeley are examples. In my ''Ancient Greek Historians'' (1909) I dwelt on the modern origin of the idea (p. 253 sqq.). Recently Mr. R. H. Murray, in a learned appendix to his ''Erasmus and Luther'', has developed the thesis that Progress was not grasped in antiquity (though he makes an exception of Seneca),—a welcome confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this gave rise to [[Progressivism|progressive]] opinion, in contrast with conservational opinion. The social conservationists were skeptical about [[panacea]]s for social ills. According to conservatives, attempts to radically remake society normally make things worse. [[Edmund Burke]] was the leading exponent of this, although later-day liberals like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] have espoused similar views. They argue that society changes organically and naturally, and that grand plans for the remaking of society, like the [[French Revolution]], [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]] hurt society by removing the traditional constraints on the exercise of power.

The scientific advances of the 16th and 17th centuries provided a basis for [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon's]] book the [[New Atlantis]]. In the 17th century, [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] described progress with respect to arts and the sciences, saying that each age has the advantage of not having to rediscover what was accomplished in preceding ages. The epistemology of [[John Locke]] provided further support and was popularized by the Encyclopedists [[Diderot]], [[Holbach]], and [[Condorcet]]. Locke had a powerful influence on the American [[Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, Thomas L. (1990). ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete statement of progress is that of [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], in his "A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind" (1750). For Turgot, progress covers not only the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture—manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society. [[Condorcet]] predicted the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s (1806–1873) ethical and political thought demonstrated faith in the power of ideas and of intellectual education for improving human nature or behavior. For those who do not share this faith the idea of progress becomes questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) pp. 224–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), a British economist of the early 20th century, was a proponent of classical liberalism. In his highly influential ''Principles of Economics'' (1890), he was deeply interested in human progress and in what is now called ''sustainable development.'' For Marshall, the importance of wealth lay in its ability to promote the physical, mental, and moral health of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Caldari, Katia (2004). "Alfred Marshall's Idea of Progress and Sustainable Development," ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'', '''26''' (4): 519–36.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the modernization and development programs undertaken in the Third World were typically based on the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1989). ''Economic Development: The History of an Idea''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia the notion of progress was first imported from the West by [[Peter the Great]] (1672–1725). An absolute ruler, he used the concept to modernize Russia and to legitimize his monarchy (unlike its usage in Western Europe, where it was primarily associated with political opposition). By the early 19th century, the notion of progress was being taken up by Russian intellectuals and was no longer accepted as legitimate by the tsars. Four schools of thought on progress emerged in 19th-century Russia: conservative (reactionary), religious, liberal, and socialist—the latter winning out in the form of Bolshevist materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Herbert J. (1965). "Economic Modernization in Imperial Russia: Purposes and Achievements," ''Journal of Economic History'' '''25''' (4): 523–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual leaders of the American Revolution, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], were immersed in Enlightenment thought and believed the idea of progress meant that they could reorganize the political system to the benefit of the human condition; both for Americans and also, as Jefferson put it, for an "[[Empire of Liberty]]" that would benefit all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–1884) was one of the most influential political theorists in Argentina. Economic liberalism was the key to his idea of progress. He promoted faith in progress, while chiding fellow Latin Americans for blind copying of American and European models. He hoped for progress through promotion of immigration, education, and a moderate type of federalism and republicanism that might serve as a transition in Argentina to true democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, John E. (1973). "Juan Bautista Alberdi: A Study of His Thought," ''Americas'' '''29''' (4): 489–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, [[Jose Mora]] (1795–1856) was a leader of [[classical liberalism]] in the first generation after independence, leading the battle against the conservative trinity of the army, the church, and the ''hacendados''. He envisioned progress as both a process of human development by the search for philosophical truth and as the introduction of an era of material prosperity by technological advancement. His plan for Mexican reform demanded a republican government bolstered by widespread popular education free of clerical control, confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical lands as a means of redistributing income and clearing government debts, and effective control of a reduced military force by the government. Mora also demanded the establishment of legal equality between native Mexicans and foreign residents. His program, untried in his lifetime, became the key element in the Mexican Constitution of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, John M. (1972). "Jose Mora: His Idea of Progress and the Origins of Mexican Liberalism," ''North Dakota Quarterly'' '''40''' (2): 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the "Mezzogiorno" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the race.&lt;ref&gt;DalLago, Enrico (2002). ''The American South and the Italian Mezzogiorno: Essays in Comparative History''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, in the 20th century the [[KMT]] or Nationalist party, which ruled from the 1920s to the 1940s, advocated progress. The Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] adopted western models and their ruinous projects caused mass famines. After Mao's death, however, the new regime led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1904–1997) and his successors aggressively promoted modernization of the economy using capitalist models and imported western technology.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, Dmitry (2004). "Deng Xiaoping and the Modernization of China," ''Far Eastern Affairs'' '''32''' (4): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among environmentalists, there is a continuum between two opposing poles. The one pole is optimistic, progressive, and business-oriented, and endorses the classic idea of progress. For example, [[bright green environmentalism]] endorses the idea that new designs, social innovations and green technologies can solve critical environmental challenges. The other is pessimistic in respect of technological solutions,&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 9, "Technological Optimism and Belief in Progress", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; warning of impending global crisis (through [[climate change]] or [[peak oil]], for example) and tends to reject the very idea of modernity and the myth of progress that is so central to modernization thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001). ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''. Cambridge University Press, pp 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], wrote about progress as a myth benefiting the few, and a pending environmental doomsday for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the philosophy of [[Deep Ecology]].

==Philosophy==
Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] said that "No single idea has been more important than ... the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years",&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defines five "crucial premises" of the idea of progress:
# value of the past
# nobility of Western civilization
# worth of economic/technological growth
# faith in reason and scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason
# intrinsic importance and worth of life on earth

Sociologist [[P. A. Sorokin]] said, "The ancient Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and most of the medieval thinkers supporting theories of rhythmical, cyclical or trendless movements of social processes were much nearer to reality than the present proponents of the linear view".&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Sorokin, 1932 paper, quoted in Fay (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Confucianism and to a certain extent Taoism, that both search for an ideal past, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition believes in the fulfillment of history, which was translated into the idea of progress in the modern age. Therefore, Chinese proponents of modernization have looked to western models. According to Thompson, the late Qing dynasty reformer, Kang Youwei, believed he had found a model for reform and "modernisation" in the Ancient Chinese Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Youwei, Kang, &amp; Lawrence G. Thompson (1958). ''Ta T'ung Shu: The One World Philosophy of Kang Yu-wei.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that progress was not fully adequate as a scientific explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1957). ''The Poverty of Historicism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], a self-proclaimed [[neo-luddism|neo-luddite]] author, wrote exclusively about progress as a myth, in an essay entitled "Five Facets of a Myth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) says that proponents of progress underestimated the extent of man's destructiveness and irrationality, while critics misunderstand the role of rationality and morality in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers (1965) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychoanalyst [[Charles Baudouin]] claimed modernity has retained the "corollary" of the progress myth, the idea that the present is superior to the past, while at the same time insisting that it is free of the myth:
{{quote|sign=|source=|
The last two centuries were familiar with the myth of progress. Our own century has adopted the myth of modernity. The one myth has replaced the other. ...

Men ceased to believe in progress; but only to pin their faith to more tangible realities, whose sole original significance had been that they were the instruments of progress. ..

This exaltation of the present ... is a corollary of that very faith in progress which people claim to have discarded. The present is superior to the past, by definition, only in a mythology of progress. Thus one retains the corollary while rejecting the principle. There is only one way of retaining a position of whose instability one is conscious. One must simply refrain from thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudouin]], ''The Myth of Modernity'', ''Le Mythe du moderne'' (1946), as translated by [[Bernard Miall]] (1950), sections 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A cyclical theory of history was adopted by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), a German historian who wrote ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' in 1920. [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the rise of [[totalitarianism]] demonstrated that progress was not automatic and that technological improvement did not necessarily guarantee democracy and moral advancement. British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975) felt that Christianity would help modern civilization overcome its challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Farrenkopf, John (1993). "Spengler's Historical Pessimism and the Tragedy of our Age," ''Theory and Society'' Vol. 22, Number 3, pp. 391–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffersonians said that history is not exhausted but that man may begin again in a new world. Besides rejecting the lessons of the past, they Americanized the idea of progress by democratizing and vulgarizing it to include the welfare of the common man as a form of [[republicanism]]. As Romantics deeply concerned with the past, collecting source materials and founding historical societies, the Founding Fathers were animated by clear principles. They saw man in control of his destiny, saw virtue as a distinguishing characteristic of a republic, and were concerned with happiness, progress, and prosperity. Thomas Paine, combining the spirit of rationalism and romanticism, pictured a time when America's innocence would sound like a romance, and concluded that the fall of America could mark the end of 'the noblest work of human wisdom.'&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] wrote in 1920:&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/ideaofprogressin00buryuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Idea of Progress'']. London: Macmillan and Co., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the minds of most people the desirable outcome of human development would be a condition of society in which all the inhabitants of the planet would enjoy a perfectly happy existence....It cannot be proved that the unknown destination towards which man is advancing is desirable.

The Progress of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal immortality. It is true or it is false, and like them it cannot be proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith.}}

In the [[postmodernist]] thought steadily gaining ground from the 1980s, the grandiose claims of the modernizers are steadily eroded, and the very concept of social progress is again questioned and scrutinized.  In the new vision, radical modernizers like [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] appear as [[totalitarian]] despots, whose vision of social progress is held to be totally deformed.  Postmodernists question the validity of 19th century and 20th century notions of progress—both on the capitalist and the Marxist side of the spectrum. They argue that both capitalism and Marxism over-emphasize technological achievements and material prosperity while ignoring the value of inner [[happiness]] and [[Wiktionary:peace of mind|peace of mind]]. Postmodernism posits that both dystopia and utopia are one and the same, overarching grand narratives with impossible conclusions.

{{anchor|Myth of Progress}}{{see also|Progress trap}}
Some 20th-century authors refer to the "Myth of Progress" to refer to the idea that the human condition will inevitably improve. In 1932, English physician [[Montague David Eder]] wrote: "The myth of progress states that civilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable direction. Progress is inevitable... Philosophers, men of science and politicians have accepted the idea of the inevitability of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= David Eder | first=Montague | year=1932 | title=The Myth of Progress | journal=D.

Psycho-Anal | volume=14 | pages=399 | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=IJP.014.0399A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eder argues that the advancement of civilization is leading to greater unhappiness and loss of control in the environment. The strongest critics of the idea of progress complain that it remains a dominant idea in the 21st century, and shows no sign of diminished influence. As one fierce critic, British historian [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (b. 1948), concludes:&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (2004). "An Illusion with a Future," ''Daedalus'' Vol. 133(3), pp 10+; also Gray (2004). ''Heresies: Against Progress and Other Illusions''. Granta Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Faith in the liberating power of knowledge is encrypted into modern life.

The illusion that through science humans can remake the world is an integral part of the modern condition. Renewing the eschatological hopes of the past, progress is an illusion with a future.}}

Recently the idea of progress has been generalized to psychology, being related with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as "what counts as a means of advancing towards the end result of a given defined goal."&lt;ref&gt;Cerbaro, R. H. and Whisler, J. L. (2016). The Idea of Progress: A Theoretical and Concise Goal-Structure Model. Current Research in Psychology, 7 (1): 12.15, p. 13.

===Antiquity===

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] said that thought in [[ancient Greece]] was dominated by the theory of world-cycles or the doctrine of eternal return, and was steeped in a belief parallel to the Judaic "[[Original sin|fall of man]]," but rather from a preceding "[[Golden Age]]" of innocence and simplicity. Time was generally regarded as the enemy of humanity which depreciates the value of the world. He credits the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] with having had a potential for leading to the foundation of a theory of progress through their materialistic acceptance of the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] as the explanation for a world without an intervening [[deity]].
{{cquote|For them, the earliest condition of men resembled that of the beasts, and from this primitive and miserable condition they laboriously reached the existing state of civilisation, not by external guidance or as a consequence of some initial design, but simply by the exercise of human intelligence throughout a long period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}

[[Robert Nisbet]] and [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] have attributed a notion of progress to other Greeks. [[Xenophanes]] said "The gods did not reveal to men all things in the beginning, but men through their own search find in the course of time that which is better." [[Plato]]'s Book III of ''[[The Laws]]'' depicts humanity's progress from a state of nature to the higher levels of culture, economy, and polity. Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'' also outlines a historical account of the progress of mankind.

===Renaissance===
During the Medieval period, science was to a large extent based on [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] (a method of thinking and learning from the [[Middle Ages]]) interpretations of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] work. The Renaissance of the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries changed the mindset in Europe towards an empirical view, based on a [[pantheistic]] interpretation of [[Plato]]. This induced a revolution in curiosity about nature in general and scientific advance, which opened the gates for technical and economic advance. Furthermore, the individual potential was seen as a never-ending quest for being God-like, paving the way for a view of Man based on unlimited perfection and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst; Paul Oskar Kristeller and John Herman Randall (eds., 1948). ''The Renaissance Philosophy of Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Enlightenment (1650–1800)===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French historian and philosopher [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) was a major proponent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At first Voltaire's thought was informed by the idea of progress coupled with rationalism. His subsequent notion of the historical idea of progress saw science and reason as the driving forces behind societal advancement.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) argued that progress is neither automatic nor continuous and does not measure knowledge or wealth, but is a painful and largely inadvertent passage from barbarism through civilization toward enlightened culture and the abolition of war. Kant called for education, with the education of humankind seen as a slow process whereby world history propels mankind toward peace through war, international commerce, and [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, Jeanne A. (1991). "Reasonable Hope: Kant as Critical Theorist," ''History of European Ideas'', '''21''' (4): 527–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish theorist [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816) defined human progress as the working out of a divine plan, though he rejected predestination. The difficulties and dangers of life provided the necessary stimuli for human development, while the uniquely human ability to evaluate led to ambition and the conscious striving for excellence. But he never adequately analyzed the competitive and aggressive consequences stemming from his emphasis on ambition even though he envisioned man's lot as a perpetual striving with no earthly culmination. Man found his happiness only in effort.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, John Andrew (1978). "Adam Ferguson and the Idea of Progress," ''Studies in Burke and His Time'' '''19''' (2): 99–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the Enlightenment, as a [[secularization]] of ideas from early [[Christianity]], and a reworking of ideas from [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIZfQTd3nSMC&amp;pg=PA402 The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought] By David Miller, Janet Coleman, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein takes a minority view in seeing evidence for ''The Idea of Progress in Classical Antiquity'', Johns Hopkins Press (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
In the 19th century, Romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically better the human condition, and in some ways could make it worse.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Christopher John, ed. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850''. Fitzroy Dearborn, Vol.  II, p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) reacted against the concept of progress as set forth by William Godwin and Condorcet because he believed that inequality of conditions is "the best (state) calculated to develop the energies and faculties of man". He said, "Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state". He argued that man's capacity for improvement has been demonstrated by the growth of his intellect, a form of progress which offsets the distresses engendered by the law of population.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Samuel M. (1966). "Malthus and the Idea of Progress," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''27''' (1): 92–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) criticized the idea of progress as the 'weakling's doctrines of optimism,' and advocated undermining concepts such as faith in progress, to allow the strong individual to stand above the plebeian masses. An important part of his thinking consists of the attempt to use the classical model of 'eternal recurrence of the same' to dislodge the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Tassone, Giuseppe (2002). ''A Study on the Idea of Progress in Nietzsche, Heidegger and Critical Theory''. E. Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) argues there was general agreement in the late 19th century that the steady accumulation of knowledge and the progressive replacement of conjectural, that is, theological or metaphysical, notions by scientific ones was what created progress. Most scholars concluded this growth of scientific knowledge and methods led to the growth of industry and the transformation of warlike societies into an industrial and pacific one. They agreed as well that there had been a systematic decline of coercion in government, and an increasing role of liberty and of rule by consent. There was more emphasis on impersonal social and historical forces; progress was increasingly seen as the result of an inner logic of society.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers, George G. (1965). "The Idea of Progress: A Critical Reassessment," ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist theory (late 19th century)===
Marx developed a theory of [[historical materialism]]. He describes the mid-19th century condition in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty, and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all which is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind.&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto of the Communist Party: Chapter 1, Marx &amp; Engels&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, Marx described the process of social progress, which in his opinion is based on the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production:

{{Quote|No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Preface|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm|work=Critique of political economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Capitalism]] is thought by Marx as a process of continual change, in which the growth of markets dissolve all fixities in human life, and Marx admits that capitalism is progressive and non-[[reactionary]]. [[Marxism]] further states that capitalism, in its quest for higher profits and new markets, will inevitably sow the seeds of its own destruction. Marxists believe that, in the future, capitalism will be replaced by [[socialism]] and eventually communism.

{{cquote|The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.|4=[[George Bernard Shaw]]}}

Many advocates of capitalism such as [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] agreed with Marx's analysis of capitalism as a process of continual change through [[creative destruction]], but, unlike Marx, believed and hoped that capitalism could essentially go on forever.

Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought—Marxism and liberalism—believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement. Marxists strongly opposed capitalism and the liberals strongly supported it, but the one concept they could both agree on was [[modernism]], a trend of thought which affirms the power of human beings to make, improve and reshape their society, with the aid of scientific knowledge, technology and practical experimentation.

The '''protocol relating to the status of refugees''' of 1967 broadens the definition of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] of 1951. The main point of the protocol was to "grant all refugees the same status irrespective of the effective date of the 1st of January 1951."

The protocol was completed on the 31st of January 1967 in [[New York City]]. Switzerland ratified the protocol on the 20th of May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Publications from Switzerland: [https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19670017/201209280000/0.142.301.pdf ''Protokoll über die Rechtsstellung der Flüchtlinge''] (PDF) von 1968, Stand: 28.

[[Image:Quantum efficiency graph for WFPC2-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|A graph showing variation of quantum efficiency with wavelength of a CCD chip in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 3]].]]
The term '''quantum efficiency''' ('''QE''') may apply to '''incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) ratio''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Sean|title=2.5% efficient organic plastic solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=2001|volume=78|issue=6|doi=10.1063/1.1345834|url=http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v78/i6/p841_s1?bypassSSO=1|accessdate=20 May 2012|bibcode = 2001ApPhL..78..841S }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[photosensitivity|photosensitive device]] or it may refer to the [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|TMR effect]] of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction.

This article deals with the term as a measurement of a device's electrical sensitivity to light. In a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) it is the percentage of [[photon]]s hitting the device's photoreactive surface that produce [[charge carrier]]s. It is measured in [[electron]]s per photon or [[ampere|amps]] per [[watt]]. Since the energy of a photon is [[proportionality (mathematics)#Inversely proportional|inversely proportional]] to its [[wavelength]], QE is often measured over a range of different wavelengths to characterize a device's [[efficiency]] at each photon energy level. The QE for photons with energy below the [[band gap]] is zero. Photographic film typically has a QE of much less than 10%,&lt;ref name=Trager200&gt;{{cite book|last=Träger|first=Frank|title=Handbook of Lasers and Optics|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642194092|pages=601, 603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad5G1HWtDRgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA603#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while CCDs can have a QE of well over 90% at some wavelengths.

==Of solar cells==
[[Image:Solarcellige-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|A graph showing variation of internal quantum efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and reflectance with wavelength of a crystalline silicon solar cell.]]

A [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|solar cell's quantum efficiency]] value indicates the amount of current that the cell will produce when irradiated by photons of a particular wavelength. If the cell's quantum efficiency is [[integral|integrated]] over the whole [[sunlight|solar electromagnetic spectrum]], one can evaluate the amount of current that the cell will produce when exposed to sunlight. The ratio between this energy-production value and the highest possible energy-production value for the cell (i.e., if the QE were 100% over the whole spectrum) gives the cell's overall [[solar cell efficiency|energy conversion efficiency]] value. Note that in the event of [[multiple exciton generation]] (MEG), quantum efficiencies of greater than 100% may be achieved since the incident photons have more than twice the [[band gap]] energy and can create two or more electron-hole pairs per incident photon.

===Types===
Two types of quantum efficiency of a solar cell are often considered:

*'''External Quantum Efficiency (EQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy ''shining on the solar cell from outside'' (incident photons).
*'''Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy that shine on the solar cell from outside ''and'' are absorbed by the cell.

The IQE is always larger than the EQE. A low IQE indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is unable to make good use of the photons. To measure the IQE, one first measures the EQE of the solar device, then measures its transmission and reflection, and combines these data to infer the IQE.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{EQE} = \frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{photons/sec}}= \frac{\text{(current)}/\text{(charge of one electron)}}{(\text{total power of photons})/(\text{energy of one photon})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{IQE} = 
\frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{absorbed photons/sec}}= 
\frac{\text{EQE}}{\text{1-Reflection}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The external quantum efficiency therefore depends on both the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light and the collection of charges. Once a photon has been absorbed and has generated an electron-hole pair, these charges must be separated and collected at the junction. A "good" material avoids charge recombination. Charge recombination causes a drop in the external quantum efficiency.

The ideal quantum efficiency graph has a [[Boxcar function|square shape]], where the QE value is fairly constant across the entire spectrum of wavelengths measured. However, the QE for most solar cells is reduced because of the effects of recombination, where charge carriers are not able to move into an external circuit. The same mechanisms that affect the collection probability also affect the QE. For example, modifying the front surface can affect carriers generated near the surface. And because high-energy (blue) light is absorbed very close to the surface, considerable recombination at the front surface will affect the "blue" portion of the QE. Similarly, lower energy (green) light is absorbed in the bulk of a solar cell, and a low diffusion length will affect the collection probability from the solar cell bulk, reducing the QE in the green portion of the spectrum. Generally, solar cells on the market today do not produce much electricity from [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] light (&lt;400&amp;nbsp;nm and &gt;1100&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths, respectively); these wavelengths of light are either filtered out or are absorbed by the cell, thus heating the cell. That heat is wasted energy, and could damage the cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/21/silicon-nanoparticle-film-can-increase-solar-cell-performance/ Silicon nanoparticle film can increase solar cell performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantum efficiency of Image Sensors''' :
Quantum efficiency (QE) is the fraction of photon flux that contributes to the photocurrent in a photodetector or
a pixel. Quantum efficiency is one of the most important parameters used to evaluate the quality of a detector and is often called the spectral response to reflect its wavelength dependence. It is defined as the number of signal electrons created per incident photon. In some cases it can exceed 100% (i.e. when more than one electron is created per incident photon).

'''EQE mapping''' :
Conventional measurement of the EQE will give the efficiency of the overall device. However it is often useful to have a map of the EQE over large area of the device. This mapping provides an efficient way to visualize the homogeneity and/or the defects in the sample. It was realized by researchers from the Institute of Researcher and Development on Photovoltaic Energy (IRDEP) who calculated the EQE mapping from electroluminescence measurements taken with an [[hyperspectral]] imager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delamarre |display-authors=etal  |title=Evaluation of micrometer scale lateral fluctuations of transport properties in CIGS solar cells |journal=Proc. SPIE  |volume=100 |date=2013 | doi=10.1117/12.2004323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Delamarre |display-authors=etal |title=Quantitative luminescence mapping of Cu(In,Ga)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin-film solar cells |journal=Progress in Photovoltaics |date=2014 | doi=10.1002/pip.2555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectral responsivity==
[[responsivity|Spectral responsivity]] is a similar measurement, but it has different units: [[ampere]]s per [[watt]] (A/W); (i.e. how much [[electric current|current]] comes out of the device per incoming photon of a given energy and wavelength). Both the quantum efficiency and the responsivity are functions of the photons' wavelength (indicated by the subscript λ).

To convert from responsivity (''R&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'', in A/W) to QE&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rogalski, K. Adamiec and J. Rutkowski, ''Narrow-Gap Semiconductor Photodiodes'', SPIE Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; (on a scale 0 to 1):

:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda}\times\frac{h c}{e}\approx\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda} {\times} (1240\;{\rm W}\cdot {\rm nm/A})  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is the wavelength in [[nanometre|nm]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]].

===Determination===
:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\eta =\frac{N_e}{N_\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt; = number of electrons produced, &lt;math&gt;N_\nu&lt;/math&gt; = number of photons absorbed.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_\nu}t = \Phi_o \frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming each photon absorbed in the depletion layer produces a viable electron-hole pair, and all other photons do not,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_e}t = \Phi_{\xi}\frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the measurement time (in seconds), 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_o&lt;/math&gt; = incident optical power in watts, 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; = optical power absorbed in depletion layer, also in watts.

In mathematics, a '''quantum groupoid''' is any of a number of notions in [[noncommutative geometry]] analogous to the notion of [[groupoid]]. In usual geometry, the information of a groupoid can be contained in its [[monoidal category]] of representations (by a version of [[Tannaka–Krein duality]]), in its groupoid algebra or in the commutative [[Hopf algebroid]] of functions on the groupoid. Thus formalisms trying to capture quantum groupoids include certain classes of (autonomous) [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]], [[Hopf algebroid]]s etc.

Cox|Don Cox]] (standing), Field Marshal of the [[Black Panther Party]], in the Bernsteins' 13-room penthouse on Park Avenue in Manhattan, January 14, 1970.&lt;ref name="nymag1970" /&gt; (Photo by Stephen Salmieri.)]]"'''Radical chic'''" is a term coined by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] in his 1970 essay "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's" to describe the adoption and promotion of [[Political radicalism|radical political]] causes by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[socialite]]s, and [[Upper class|high society]]. The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terrorist chic==

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

{{Democracy}}
'''Radical democracy''' was articulated by [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]] in their book ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics]]'', written in 1985.  They argue that [[social movements]] which attempt to create [[social change|social and political change]] need a strategy which challenges [[neoliberal]] and [[neoconservative]] concepts of [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="hegemony"&gt;Laclau, E and Mouffe, C. (1985). ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics'', Verso: London.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is to expand the [[Liberalism|liberal]] definition of democracy, based on [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Equality before the law|equality]], to include [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]].&lt;ref name="hegemony" /&gt;

"Radical democracy" means "the root of democracy".  Laclau and Mouffe claim that [[liberal democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]], in their attempts to build [[consensus]], oppress differing opinions, races, classes, genders, and worldviews.&lt;ref name="hegemony"/&gt;  In the world, in a country, and in a social movement there are many (a plurality of) differences which resist consensus.  Radical democracy is not only accepting of difference, [[dissent]] and antagonisms, but is dependent on it.&lt;ref name="hegemony" /&gt;  Laclau and Mouffe argue based on the assumption that there are oppressive [[Power (philosophy)|power]] relations that exist in society and that those oppressive relations should be made visible, re-negotiated and altered.&lt;ref name="hegemony" /&gt;  By building democracy around difference and dissent, oppressive power relations existing in societies are able to come to the forefront so that they can be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Mouffe, C. (1996). ''Democracy, Power, and the ‘Political’''. In Benhabib, S. (ed.) Democracy and Difference (pp. 245-255). Princeton: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other contexts, radical democracy is a term used to refer to the [[post-Marxist]] perspectives of [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Italian radicalism]]—especially [[Paolo Virno]].

== Re-interpretations ==
Since Laclau and Mouffe argued for a radical democracy, many other theorists and practitioners have  adapted and changed the term.  For example,  [[bell hooks]] and [[Henry Giroux]] have all written about education for a radical democracy. [[Paulo Freire]]'s work, although initiated decades before Laclau and Mouffe, can also be read through similar lenses. &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (2004). ''Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;hooks, b. (1996). ''Representation and Democracy: An Interview''. In Trend, D. (ed.) Radical Democracy: Identity, Citizenship, and the State (pp. 228-236). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (1996). ''Pedagogy and Radical Democracy in the Age of “Political Correctness”''. In Trend, D. (ed.) Radical Democracy: Identity, Citizenship, and the State (pp. 179-194). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Paul Chatterton]] and [[Richard JF Day]] have written about the importance of radical democracy within some of the autonomous movements in Latin America (namely the EZLN—[[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the MST—[[Landless Workers' Movement]] in Brazil, and the [[Piquetero]]—Unemployed Workers Movement in Argentina).&lt;ref&gt;Chatterton, P. ''Making Autonomous Geographies: Argentina’s Popular Uprising and the ‘Movimiento de Traebajadores Desocupados (Unemployed Workers Movement)'', Geoforum, (2005), Volume 36, Issue 5, pp. 545-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day, R. (2005). ''[[Gramsci Is Dead: Anarchist Currents in the Newest Social Movements]]''. Between the lines: Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Because of radical democracy's focus on difference, and challenging oppressive power relations, it has been seen as conducive to [[post-colonial theory]] and [[decolonization]].  However, the concept of radical democracy is seen in some circles as colonial in nature due to its reliance on a western notion of democracy.&lt;ref name="dhaliwal"&gt;Dhaliwal, A. (1996). ''Can the Subaltern Vote? Radical Democracy, Discourses of Representation and Rights, and Questions of Race.'' In Trend, D. (ed.) Radical Democracy: Identity, Citizenship, and the State (pp. 42-61). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, radical democracy challenges [[consensus decision-making]] processes which are essential to many indigenous governing practices.&lt;ref name="dhaliwal" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="974">In [[behaviorism]], '''rate  of response''' is a ratio between two measurements with different units. Rate of responding is the number of responses per minute, or some other time unit. It is usually written as ''R''. Its first major exponent was [[B.F. Skinner]] (1939). It is used in the [[Matching Law]].

''R'' = # of Responses/Unit of time = ''B''/''t''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Real freedom''' is a term coined by the [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] and [[economist]] [[Philippe Van Parijs]]. It expands upon notions of [[negative freedom]] by incorporating not simply institutional or other constraints on a person's choices, but also the requirements of physical reality, resources and personal capacity. To have real freedom, according to Van Parjis, an individual must:

:1. not be prevented from acting on their will (i.e. they must have traditional negative freedom)
:2. possess the resources or capacities actually to carry out their will.

Under this conception, a [[moral agent]] could be ''negatively'' free to take a holiday in [[Miami]], because no-one is forcing them not to (condition 1 is met); but not ''really'' free to do so, because they cannot afford the flight (condition 2 is not met). Similarly, someone could be negatively free to swim across the [[English Channel]]; but not really free, because they are not a good enough swimmer and would not be able to succeed in the task. Real freedom is, then, a matter of ''degree'' — one is more or less really free, not just either really free or not; and no-one has ''complete'' real freedom — no-one is currently really free to [[Teleportation|teleport]] to [[Mars]], for instance.

Real freedom expands on negative freedom by adding the idea of actually being able to exercise a capacity or resource in the absence of constraint; but does not go as far as some ideas of positive freedom, by refraining from appeal to self-government by a real, best, or higher self.

Van Parijs uses the concept of real freedom as part of his influential argument for a [[universal basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philippe |last=Van Parijs |title=Real Freedom For All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism? |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers, particularly advocates of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]], promote the view that causation in biological systems is inherently reciprocal.&lt;ref name="Laland2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|journal=Proc R Soc B|date=2015|volume=282|page=20151019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Harvard evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] (1961)&lt;ref name="Mayr1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=Cause and effect in biology|journal=Science|date=1961|volume=134|pages=1501-1506|bibcode=1961Sci...134.1501M|doi=10.1126/science.134.3489.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, [[Proximate and ultimate causation|‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’]]. Ultimate causes (e.g. [[natural selection]]) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. [[physiology]]) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayr, 1980&lt;ref name="Mayr1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=E|editor1-last=Mayr|editor1-first=E|editor2-last=Provine|editor2-first=WB|title=The Evolutionary Synthesis|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA|pages=1-48|chapter=Some thoughts on the history of the evolutionary synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate [[dichotomy]] within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate-ultimate distinction]] implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West-Eberhard, 2003&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: [[genotypes]] cause [[phenotypes]] (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in [[Environment (biophysical)|environments]] cause changes in [[organisms]] (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt; (see also &lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|title=The Strategy of the Genes|date=1957|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=D|title=The proximate and the ultimate: past, present, and future|journal=Behav Process|date=1999|volume=46|pages=189-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierry|first1=B|title=Integrating proximate and ultimate causation: just one more go!|journal=Curr Sci|date=2005|volume=89|pages=1180-1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. 

==Reciprocal causation in evolutionary biology==
Reciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary [[evolutionary biology]], including [[sexual selection]] theory, [[coevolution]], habitat selection, and [[frequency-dependent selection]]. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a [[Peafowl|peacock]]’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen [[mate choice]] decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.

Reciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]], or [[epigenetic inheritance]]) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. [[niche construction]]), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to [[natural selection]] of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of [[adaptive evolution]]. This goes beyond the recognition that [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic processes]] can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Contention==
Acceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology)]], [[niche construction]], [[cultural evolution]], human cooperation, and the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|last9=Wray|first9=GA|last10=Hoekstra|first10=HE|last11=Futuyma|first11=DJ|last12=Lenski|first12=RE|last13=Mackay|first13=TFC|last14=Schluter|first14=D|last15=Strassmann|first15=JE|title=Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=514|pages=161-164|bibcode=2014Natur.514..161L|doi=10.1038/514161a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawkins|first1=R|title=Extended phenotype—but not too extended.

A '''role-playing game system''' is a set of [[game mechanics]] used in a [[role-playing game]] (RPG) to determine the outcome of a [[Player character|character]]'s in-game actions.

==History==
By the late 1970s, the [[Chaosium]] staff realized that [[Steve Perrin]]'s ''[[RuneQuest]]'' system had the potential to become a "house system", where one set of game mechanics could be used for multiple games; [[Greg Stafford]] and [[Lynn Willis]] proved that theory by boiling down the RuneQuest rules into the thin 16-page ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}} [[Hero Games]] used their ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' rules as the basis for their [[Hero System]].&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|146}} The [[Pacesetter Ltd|Pacesetter]] house system centered on a universal "action table" that used one chart to resolve all game actions.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|197}} [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Steve Jackson]] became interested in publishing a new roleplaying system, designed by himself, with three goals: that it be detailed and realistic; logical and well-organized; and adaptable to any setting and any level of play; this system was eventually released as ''[[GURPS]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|104–107}} The ''D&amp;D''-derived [[Megaversal system|Palladium house system]] ultimately encompassed all of the [[Palladium Books]] titles.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|60}} ''[[Mekton|Mekton II]]'' (1987) by [[R. Talsorian Games]] revealed for the first time the full-fledged [[Interlock System]].&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|208}}

In 1990, [[Game Designers' Workshop]] released the ''[[Twilight: 2000]]'' second edition game system , and decided to turn it into their house system, an umbrella under which all future games would be designed.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|60}} [[TSR (company)|TSR]]'s ''[[Amazing Engine]]'' was a [[Generic role-playing game system|universal game system]], a simple beginner's system.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|27}} In 1996, Hero Games partnered with R. Talsorian and decided to create a new, simpler rules system to attract new players, merging it with the Interlock game system and calling it Fuzion.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|150}} ''[[Dragonlance: Fifth Age]]'' (1996) was built on TSR's new [[SAGA System|SAGA]] storytelling game system, which centered on resource management (through cards) rather than die rolls.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|29}} TSR published ''[[Alternity]]'' (1997), another universal system, this one directed only toward science-fiction games.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|29}} [[West End Games]]' MasterBook system had failed to catch on as a house system, so they decided to publish another, the [[D6 System]], based on their most well-known and well-tested game system, ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|Star Wars]]'' RPG.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|194}}

==Development==
While early role-playing games relied heavily on either group consensus or the judgement of a single player (the "Dungeon Master" or [[Game Master]]) or on randomizers such as dice, later generations of [[narrativist]] games allow role-playing to influence the creative input and output of the players, so both acting out roles and employing rules take part in shaping the outcome of the game.

An RPG system also affects the game environment, which can take any of several forms. [[Generic role-playing game systems]], such as ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'', ''[[GURPS]]'', and ''[[Fate (role-playing game system)|Fate]]'', are not tied to a specific storytelling [[genre]] or [[campaign setting]] and can be used as a framework to play many different types of RPG.  Others, such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', are designed to depict a specific genre or style of play, and still others, such as ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', are not only genre-specific but come bundled with a specific campaign setting to which the game mechanics are inseparably tied.  In fact, in more psychological games such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[King Arthur Pendragon]]'', ''[[Unknown Armies]]'', and ''[[Don't Rest Your Head]]'', aspects of the game system are designed to reinforce psychological or emotional dynamics that evoke a game world's specific atmosphere.

Many role-playing game systems involve the generation of random numbers by which success or failure of an action is determined.  This can be done using [[dice]] (probably the most common method) or [[Playing card|card]]s (as in ''[[Castle Falkenstein (role-playing game)|Castle Falkenstein]]''), but other methods may be used depending on the system. The random result is added to an '''[[attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]]''' which is then compared to a '''difficulty rating''', although many variations on this game mechanic exist among systems. Some (such as the ''[[Storyteller System|Storyteller]]''/''[[Storytelling System]]'' and the ''[[One-Roll Engine]]'') use [[dice pool]]s instead of individual dice to generate a series of random numbers, some of which may be discarded or used to determine the magnitude of the result.  However, some games (such as the ''[[Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game]]'' and ''[[Nobilis]]'') use no random factor at all. These instead use direct comparison of character ability scores to difficulty values, often supplemented with points from a finite but renewable pool.  These "resource points" represent a character's additional effort or luck, and can be used strategically by the player to influence the success of an action.

[[File:Gerbrand van den Eeckhout 003.jpg|thumb|260px|right|''Scholar and His Books'' by [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]].]]
The '''scholarly method''' or '''scholarship''' is the body of [[principle]]s and [[Practice (social theory)|practice]]s used by [[wikt:scholar|scholars]] to make their claims about the world as valid and trustworthy as possible, and to make them known to the scholarly public. It is the methods that systemically advance the [[teaching]], [[research]], and [[:wikt:practice|practice]] of a given scholarly or academic field of study through rigorous inquiry. Scholarship is noted by its significance to its particular profession{{huh|date=October 2018}}, and is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and can be and is [[peer-reviewed]] through various methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacn.nche.edu/publications/position/defining-scholarship Aacn.nche.edu, Retrieved 15OCT2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Originally started to reconcile the [[philosophy]] of the ancient [[classical philosophy|classical philosophers]] with medieval [[Christian theology|theology]], [[scholasticism]] is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].  The primary purpose of scholasticism is to find the answer to a question or to resolve a contradiction.  It was once well known for its application in medieval theology but was eventually applied to classical philosophy and many other fields of study.

The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The question of the nature, and indeed the possibility, of sound historical method is raised in the [[philosophy of history]], as a question of [[epistemology]]. History guidelines commonly used by historians in their work require [[external criticism]], internal criticism, and [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]].

The [[empirical method]] is generally taken to mean the collection of data on which to base a [[hypothesis]] or derive a conclusion in [[science]]. It is part of the [[scientific method]], but is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with other methods. The empirical method is not sharply defined and is often contrasted with the precision of experiments, where data is derived from the systematic manipulation of variables. The [[experimental method]] investigates [[causality|causal]] relationships among [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]. An experiment is a cornerstone of the [[empiricism|empirical]] approach to acquiring data about the world and is used in both [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s. An experiment can be used to help solve practical problems and to support or negate [[theory|theoretical]] assumptions.

The scientific method refers to a body of techniques for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]], acquiring new [[knowledge]], or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]], [[empirical]] and measurable [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794–6}}, Christian Horsley from the General Scholium, which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Shell to Sea''' ({{lang-ga|Shell chun Sáile}}) is an Irish organisation based in the parish of [[Kilcommon]] in [[Erris]], [[County Mayo]].

It opposes the proposed construction of a [[natural gas]] [[Gas pipeline|pipeline]] through the parish, as well as the ongoing construction&amp;mdash;by [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Statoil]] and Vermilion Energy Trust&amp;mdash;of a [[Oil refinery|refinery]] at [[Bellanaboy]] intended to refine the natural gas from the [[Corrib gas field]]. It proposes instead that the gas be refined at sea, rather than inland, as is done with Ireland's only other producing gas field off [[County Cork]]. Shell to Sea believes the proximity of a raw natural gas pipeline is a risk to local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Accufacts_Report_Hi_res.pdf |title=Report |work=publicinquiry.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231193519/http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Accufacts_Report_Hi_res.pdf |archivedate=31 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three stated aims of the campaign, as cited on its website, are that "Any exploitation of the Corrib gas field be done in a safe way that will not expose the local community in Erris to unnecessary health, safety and environmental risks", "To renegotiate the terms of the Great Oil and Gas Giveaway, which sees Ireland's 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent off the West Coast go directly to the oil companies, with the Irish State retaining a 0% share, no energy security of supply and only 25% tax on profits against which all costs can be deducted" and "To seek justice for the human rights abuses suffered by Shell to Sea campaigners due to their opposition to Shell's proposed inland refinery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelltosea.com/content/campaign-aims|title=Campaign Aims|work=Shell to Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of note include the 2005 jailing of the [[Rossport Five]] and the public outcry that followed,&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; the 2007 [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] received by [[Willie Corduff]] (one of the five), local fisherman Pat O'Donnell's laying of 800 crab pots at sea and [[Maura Harrington]]'s hunger strike against the [[Allseas]] pipe-laying ship ''[[Solitaire (ship)|Solitaire]]'' in 2008, an [[Willie Corduff#2009 alleged assault|alleged assault on Corduff]] in 2009 which was condemned by [[Desmond Tutu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Áine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6575&amp;Itemid=38|title=Archbishop Tutu speaks out on Corrib as seven are arrested: Nobel Peace Laureate and internationally renowned human rights activist, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has spoken out about the controversial Corrib gas controversy|newspaper=The Mayo News|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011 "rape tape" scandal when [[Gardaí]] (police) accidentally filmed themselves joking about the imagined rape of two female protestors after arresting them,&lt;ref name="Corribgate scandal Gardaí caught on confiscated camcorder"/&gt; and the reports of gifts of alcohol worth tens of thousands of euros from Shell to the Gardaí, which broke in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/shell-pipeline-protests-county-mayo&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Corrib gas controversy}}
Opposition to the gas consortium and [[Irish government|government]]'s plans among local residents grew from 2000 when local residents felt they were not adequately consulted. They opposed planning permission and appealed it to [[An Bord Pleanála]] twice. It was felt that government pressure was used to force the planning permission through. They also felt misled about the safety of the gas pipeline which did not require planning permission under the 1976 Gas Act.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Fiosru_2_HI_RES_Final.pdf |title=FIOSRU - November 9 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229225619/http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Fiosru_2_HI_RES_Final.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
The first event organised by Shell to Sea was on the June Bank Holiday weekend in 2005 in support of [[Rossport]] residents' protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/9761|title=Shell's assault on Erris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local landowners in Rossport had previously been told that the raw gas pipeline would be coming through their lands no matter what, and that they would be subject to [[Compulsory Purchase Order|Compulsory Acquisition Orders]] if unwilling to reach a deal with Shell.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; Some&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; agreed to allow Shell on their lands. Others refused, and [[Frank Fahey]], then [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources]] signed 34 Compulsory Acquisition Orders. Those who had refused were threatened with legal action. Legal action was taken which eventually culminated in four farmers and their former teacher, who had joined them in blocking Shell workers coming on their lands, being jailed on 29 June for civil [[contempt of court]] (at the request of Shell) after refusing to give an undertaking not to interfere with Shell's workers. They became known as the [[Rossport Five]].

24-hour pickets on the Shell sites at Rossport, Bellanaboy and [[Glengad]] began after their jailing.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; Rallies in support of the men's stance were held in major towns and cities, and Shell and Statoil filling stations were picketed.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/10589|title=Campaign grows across Ireland|newspaper=An Phoblacht|accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these protests emerged the national Shell to Sea campaign.

The Rossport Five were released on 30 September, after their imprisonment had dominated proceedings in the parliament. [[Peter Cassells]] was appointed as a negotiator to arbitrate between the campaigners and Shell. As his remit did not include discussing the refinery, he was regarded as a distraction by Shell to Sea. The pickets at Bellanaboy continued for over a year, during which no work was done by Shell.

===2006===
On Tuesday 26 September 2006, protesters prevented Shell's employees from entering the site of the intended refinery at Bellanaboy to begin work. Around 150 locals and protesters blocked the entrance to the refinery site and began to recite the [[rosary]]. The workers turned back{{citation needed|date=September 2007}} after discussions with [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]].{{citation needed|date=September 2007}}

One week later on 3 October, more Gardaí were brought in from around the country, which increased their numbers to around 170. This marked a departure in Garda tactics which they have held to. An editorial in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' stated: ''"The Garda [[baton charge]]s that occurred on Friday morning in Bellanaboy were not the product of Sinn Féin or [[Provisional IRA]] machinations; they were the product of abject Government incompetence."''&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', 26 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A decision to avoid arresting protesters in order to damp down the negative publicity that would ensue was discussed in the Garda magazine, ''Garda Review''. A number of people were injured and one young woman was brought to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=420&amp;Itemid=38l|title=Shell enter Bellanaboy site: Up to 170 Gardaí facilitated the entry of Shell workers to the Bellanaboy terminal site|publisher=Mayonews.ie|date=3 October 2006|accessdate=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters occupied [[Shell Ireland]] HQ in [[Dublin]]'s [[Leeson Street]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1011/corrib.html|title=Protest continues in Co Mayo|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and daily protests continued at Bellanaboy with some arrests made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1012/corrib.html|title=Sit-down protests at entrance to Corrib gas terminal site at Bellanaboy|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=12 October 2006|accessdate=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Fahy|authorlink=Jim Fahy|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1020/morningireland.html|title=Shell to Sea in day of action at gas terminal site|work=[[Morning Ireland]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=20 October 2006|accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shell to sea1.jpg|thumb|Protest at gate of intended [[refinery]] site, [[Bellanaboy]], September 2007]] --&gt;

A second large scale protest march took place on 10 November, the anniversary of the execution of [[Ken Saro Wiwa]] and eight other anti-Shell activists in [[Nigeria]] in 1995. When protesters worked their way around Gardaí lines, clashes occurred, resulting in several injuries. Small groups of demonstrators who had been unable to get to the refinery attempted to blockade the nearby Lennon's quarry which supplies material for the construction of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1110/mayo.html|title=Protestors block convoy of vehicles taking construction workers to Corrib gas site|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was political controversy in Ireland about the use of such force on a peaceful demonstration. [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]], leader of [[Fianna Fáil]], said in a statement that the [[Irish government]]'s position was clear in relation to the Corrib gas situation - that the negotiating is over and "that is it". In relation to the policing of the protests, he and the Opposition's [[Enda Kenny]], leader of [[Fine Gael]], would only reiterate that "the law must be obeyed".

A further large scale protest at Bellanaboy scheduled for 24 November was cancelled by the protesters for fear of further serious injuries from Gardaí.&lt;ref name="breakingnews2006"/&gt;

===2007===
On 5 June, five protesters chained themselves together{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} outside the [[Bord na Móna]] facility near [[Bangor Erris]] where Shell have been dumping the peat removed from Bellinaboy.

On 12 September, a protester charged with public order offences had her case dismissed in [[Belmullet]] because of conflicting Garda evidence. The judge dismissed most of the charges and sentenced the five protesters from June to community service for threatening and abusive behaviour. The judge also disclosed that she had received "hate mail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=38192&amp;cat=news|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090619151226/http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=38192&amp;cat=news|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 June 2009|title=''Western People'' article|publisher=Westernpeople.ie|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shell to Sea kayak training.jpg|thumb|right|Shell to Sea kayak training, [[Glengad]], August 2008]] --&gt;
In April 2008, a new group was set up by people formerly active in S2S. [[Pobal Chill Chomáin]] proposed moving the refinery to Glinsk, which would have removed the necessity to transport the gas near people's homes and under roads. The proposal was rejected by both Shell{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} and the government.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 2008, a new security firm, [[Integrated Risk Management Services]], was brought in{{by whom|date=February 2013}} to defend Shell's preparations for the landfall of the raw gas pipeline. In August, S2S began training for marine protests in anticipation of the arrival of the [[Allseas]] pipe-laying ship ''[[Solitaire (ship)|Solitaire]]'', the biggest of its kind in the world with a collection of small boats.

In the meantime, a local Porturlin fisherman, Pat O'Donnell, laid 800 crab pots along the intended path of ''Solitaire'', and defended them from Shell survey boats which attempted to remove them. The [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] stated that as both parties had licenses for their activities, they would have to sort it out between themselves. Two [[Irish Navy]] ships arrived in Broadhaven Bay to assist the [[Garda Water Unit]] in dealing with the protests. ''Solitaire'' was boarded by S2S activists in [[Killybegs]]. Not long after it arrived to Mayo's coast, the ship's company said it had suffered damage to its crane. It returned to Britain for repairs. [[Maura Harrington]] began a [[hunger strike]] to coincide with the arrival of ''Solitaire'', the [[Allseas]] pipe-laying vessel, in [[Broadhaven Bay]]. Harrington, who had recently retired as principal of the local Inver Primary School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0910/breaking8.html?via=mr|title=Corrib work suspended for 'technical' reasons|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued her protest until the ship left Irish waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0920/1221835126751.html|title=Shell to Sea protester ends 10-day hunger strike|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=20 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
In March 2009, Maura Harrington was sentenced to a month in [[Mountjoy Prison]], for assaulting a Garda at McGrath's pier. In July 2009, Niall Harnett and Maura Harrington, two leading Corrib gas activists were jailed for four months over demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0730/breaking77.htm|title=Two Shell protesters jailed|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iGye_GC-ITa9Lpf35__SCt7lrc0A|title=Gas pipeline protesters jailed|work=[[The Press Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the Garda Ombudsman Commission recommended that disciplinary action be taken against a senior member of An Garda Síochána over the handling of the June 2007 protest.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} In a separate development, An Bord Pleanála found that up to half of the final section of Shell's proposed route for the onshore pipeline was ‘unacceptable’ on safety grounds.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===2010===
Shell failed to meet An Bord Pleanala's deadline in February and applied for an extension of time to put their proposals forward as to how the project might proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0201/1224263502431.html|title=Shell asks for more time to resolve Corrib gas issues|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=1 February 2010|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat O'Donnell, from [[Kilcommon|Porturlin]], was sentenced to seven months imprisonment in February.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0218/1224264714612.html|title=Shell confirms key parts of Corrib gas project postponed|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=18 February 2010|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Niall Harnett of [[Kilcommon]], was jailed.

Brian Barrington BL in a report commissioned for [[Front Line Defenders]] found serious problems in North Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0427/1224269159758.html|title=Frontline report: Main points|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=27 April 2010|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday 31 May 2010, Shell submitted a third revised EIS to An Bord Pleanala for a revised pipeline route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0602/1224271675717.html|title=Planning board to assess latest Corrib plan|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
In April 2011, it emerged that Gardaí who had just arrested two female protestors had made explicit jokes about raping them.&lt;ref name="Corribgate scandal Gardaí caught on confiscated camcorder"&gt;{{cite news|first=Áine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12344:gardai-in-corribgate-scandal&amp;catid=23:news&amp;Itemid=46|title=Gardaí in Corribgate scandal: Corrib Gardaí caught on confiscated camcorder: Investigation under way after ‘rape’ comments found on protestor's tape|newspaper=The Mayo News|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had inadvertently recorded themselves making the comments on a video camera they had taken from one of the women, which they later returned with the recording on it. The comments were widely criticised. In December the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld a complaint about RTÉ's television reporting of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's interim report. The report confirmed that the tape had recorded Gardaí joking about raping the women. The interim report found no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed by Gardaí and no evidence of a breach of discipline. The complaint, which was upheld, stated that RTÉ's report was inaccurate, lacked fairness, objectivity and impartiality and caused the woman involved undue harm and offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1203/1224308523089.html|title=RTÉ report on Corrib tape breached 'fairness'|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=3 December 2011|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct actions continued to hamper construction activities throughout 2011 and 2012. In May, 30 to 35 sections of wooden bog road were removed from their positions in the Shell site at Aughoose in a mass direct action by protestors. In June, between 400 and 500 people attended the ''Party Against the Pipe'' near the Shell compound in Aughoose, a family friendly gathering with craft workshops, music and food to mark the tenth anniversary of resistance to Shell's activities in Erris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Flood|url=http://www.wsm.ie/c/hundreds-gather-erris-party-against-pipe|title=Hundreds gather in Erris for the Party Against the Pipe|publisher=[[Workers Solidarity Movement]]|date=8 June 2011|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct actions continued to hamper construction activities throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013.

===2012===
Another gathering took place over the June bank holiday weekend. In July, Shell attempted to transport the tunnel boring machine from Dubin Port to Ballinaboy, but were met by many direct actions. Close to the compound, the oversize transport lorry drove off the road and remained stuck in the bog for several days. There were several arrests and assaults of protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0802/breaking45.html|title=Shell machine remains stuck|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Shell to Sea launched a new report on the location of Ireland's oil and gas reserves, which depicted all the areas of oil and gas exploration, oil and gas discoveries and commercial fields for the first time on a single map, as well as publishing the license holding companies' estimates of how much each was worth. The report, entitled 'Liquid Assets: Ireland's oil and gas resources and how they could be managed for the people's benefit', was launched by [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]], Socialist Party MEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=O'Loughlin|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/world/reserving-expectations-207108.html|title=Will consumers miss out on potential oil and gas bonanza?|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
In February 2013, with Shell having revealed 2012 profits of €19.6 billion, people blocked trucks on their way to the multinational corporation's tunnelling compound at Aughoose. Campaigner Terence Conway said: "These obscene profits announced by Shell this week come at the expense of communities and the environment where Shell operate". Campaigner Maura Harrington said: "The Government are still willing to force suffering on the people of Ireland through severe cutbacks, yet at the same time give our oil and gas away to multinational companies such as Shell, with no benefit to country. It is time for people to demand that this situation is changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/shell-to-sea-protesters-block-trucks-en-route-to-compound-583405.html|title=Shell to Sea protesters block trucks en route to compound|work=BreakingNews.ie|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rossport Solidarity Camp==
[[File:Rossport Solidarity Camp.jpg|thumb|right|Rossport Solidarity Camp, [[Rossport]], February 2007]]
The Rossport Solidarity Camp was originally set up on ‘Rossport 5’ Philip McGrath's land in early July 2005. The site of the camp was on the proposed pipeline route. Set up at the request of local people who sought outside support in their campaign against the gas project, it houses national and international activists. In Spring 2006, the camp was set up again close to the beach at Glengad near the ‘landfall’ for Shell's proposed pipeline. [[Mayo County Council]] evicted the camp and it closed in December 2007. Since then the "camp" has been organised from the Rossport Solidarity House in Pollathomas. On Saturday 16 August 2008, the camp was set up afresh with two large tents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aoife|last=Finneran|url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/dirty-war-what-really-is-going-on-at-the-battle-of-rossport-1479997.html|title=Dirty War: what really is going on at the battle of Rossport? - Opinion, Frontpage|work=Herald.ie|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=22 September 2008|accessdate=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, camp members picketed the Shell compound near the beach at Glengad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0730/breaking77.htm|title=Two Corrib gas protesters jailed|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It organises informational weekends etc. In the same month they organised a beach party weekend to highlight the Glengad beach landfall site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Toni|last=Bourke|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/1146|title=Reclaim Glendad Beach party this weekend|newspaper=Mayo Advertiser|publisher=Advertiser.ie|date=8 August 2008|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, about 40 Gardaí were stationed below the Camp to prevent activists from accessing either the beach or the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O2 Ideas Room |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/tight-security-as--shell-pipelaying-ship-nears-land-1791515.html|title=Tight security as Shell pipe-laying ship nears land - National News, Frontpage|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

The campaign has a diverse support base,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} including people from many political backgrounds{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} and those with no strong politics at all.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} Local campaigners include former Fianna Fáil and [[Fine Gael]] supporters. Philip McGrath, one of the Rossport Five, was an election agent for Fine Gael leader [[Enda Kenny]]. [[Werner Blau]], a [[physics]] professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and part-time Rossport resident, told his neighbours that the pipeline intended for Rossport would not even comply with [[United States]] standards, which he described as "pretty lax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis, Ireland correspondent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1530695,00.html|title=Jailing of Irish villagers sparks anger as farmers defy Shell in Battle of the Bog: Support swells for opponents of gas pipeline imprisoned for contempt of court|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=18 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its rankings of countries' facilitation of oil and gas companies, the [[World Bank]] rates Ireland in its highest, "very favourable" category,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} along with [[Pakistan]] and [[Argentina]].

In 2006, Shell were accused of trying to influence local business, when the owner of a local adventure centre alleged that Shell offered him €15,000 in return for his support for the construction of the pipeline in 2005. Shell said in response, that at no point was such an offer made as it was against their business principles but that Shell had given a donation of €150 to a [[windsurfing]] festival following a request by the businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=McDonald|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/shell-offered-to-pay-15000-for-support-73717.html|title=Shell 'offered to pay €15,000' for support|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=17 October 2006|accessdate=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of infiltration by political activists from outside the area and intimidation of project supporters had also been rife, but these were denied by the then independent [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Jerry Cowley]] and local Fine Gael [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Michael Ring]].&lt;ref name="breakingnews2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=21/11/2006 - 16:12:21|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/shell-to-sea-campaign-gets-cross-party-support-286033.html |title='Shell to Sea' campaign gets cross-party support|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|date=21 November 2006|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring originally supported S2S, though later changed his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Workplace bullying]]|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=1710340&amp;issue_id=14795|title=Irish Independent|publisher=Unison.ie|date=21 October 2006|accessdate=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardaí also made allegations of intimidation, though no arrests were made or individuals questioned. The president of [[Belmullet]] [[chamber of commerce]] told the media that what was described as "intimidation" is actually [[boycott]]ing of pro-Shell businesses by S2S supporters. He told ''[[The Irish Times]]'': "It has never been anything more serious than that, but that is serious enough."&lt;ref&gt;"Erris will never be the same again", ''The Irish Times'', 27 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[homological algebra]], a '''''t''-structure''' is a way to axiomatize the properties of an [[abelian category|abelian subcategory]] of a [[derived category]].  A ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; consists of two subcategories &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; of a [[triangulated category]] or stable [[infinity category]] which abstract the idea of complexes whose cohomology vanishes in positive, respectively negative, degrees.  There can be many distinct ''t''-structures on the same category, and the interplay between these structures has implications for algebra and geometry.  The notion of a ''t''-structure arose in the work of Beilinson, Bernstein, Deligne, and Gabber on [[perverse sheaf|perverse sheaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Beĭlinson, A. A.; Bernstein, J.; Deligne, P. ''Faisceaux pervers.'' Analysis and topology on singular spaces, I (Luminy, 1981),  5–171, Astérisque, 100, Soc. Math. France, Paris, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Fix a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; with translation functor &lt;math&gt;[1]&lt;/math&gt;.  A '''''t''-structure''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; of full subcategories, each of which is stable under isomorphism, which satisfy the following three axioms.
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(X, Y[-1]) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''X''[1] is also an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, if ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y''[-1] is also an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''A'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y[-1] \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.
It can be shown that the subcategories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; are closed under extensions in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, they are stable under finite direct sums.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a stable &amp;infin;-category, then a '''''t''-structure''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a ''t''-structure on its homotopy category &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{h}\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; (which is a triangulated category).

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; (either a triangulated category or a stable &amp;infin;-category).  In this case, for any integer ''n'', we define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; to be the full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; whose objects have the form &lt;math&gt;X[-n]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt; is the full subcategory of objects &lt;math&gt;Y[-n]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  More briefly, we define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^{\le n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}^{\le 0}[-n], \\
\mathcal{D}^{\ge n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}[-n].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
With this notation, the axioms above may be rewritten as:
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(X, Y) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0} \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{\le 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0} \supseteq \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''A'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''heart''' or '''core''' of the ''t''-structure is the full subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\heartsuit&lt;/math&gt; consisting of objects in both &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\heartsuit = \mathcal{D}^{\le 0} \cap \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The heart of a ''t''-structure is an [[abelian category]] (whereas a triangulated category is additive but almost never abelian), and it is stable under extensions.

A triangulated or stable &amp;infin;-category with a choice of ''t''-structure is sometimes called a '''''t''-category'''.

===Variations===
It is clear that, to define a ''t''-structure, it suffices to fix integers ''m'' and ''n'' and specify &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Some authors define a ''t''-structure to be the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1})&lt;/math&gt;.

The two subcategories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt; determine each other.  An object ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X, Y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all objects ''Y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa.  That is, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1})&lt;/math&gt; are left and right orthogonal complements of each other.  Consequently it is enough to specify only one of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above notation is adapted to the study of cohomology.  When the goal is to study homology, slightly different notation is used.  A '''homological ''t''-structure''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}, \mathcal{D}_{\le 0})&lt;/math&gt; such that, if we define
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}) = (\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}, \mathcal{D}_{\le 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a (cohomological) ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the definition is the same except that upper indices are converted to lower indices and the roles of &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; are swapped.  If we define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_{\ge n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}[n], \\
\mathcal{D}_{\le n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}_{\le 0}[n],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then the axioms for a homological ''t''-structure may be written explicitly as
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\le -1}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(X, Y) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\ge 1} \subseteq \mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\le 1} \supseteq \mathcal{D}_{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''A'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\le -1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
===The natural ''t''-structure===
The most fundamental example of a ''t''-structure is the '''natural ''t''-structure''' on a derived category.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an abelian category, and let &lt;math&gt;D(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; be its derived category.  Then the natural ''t''-structure is defined by the pair of subcategories
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D(\mathcal{A})^{\le 0} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &gt; 0,\ H^i(X) = 0\}, \\
D(\mathcal{A})^{\ge 0} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &lt; 0,\ H^i(X) = 0\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It follows immediately that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D(\mathcal{A})^{\le n} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &gt; n,\ H^i(X) = 0\}, \\
D(\mathcal{A})^{\ge n} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &lt; n,\ H^i(X) = 0\}, \\
D(\mathcal{A})^\heartsuit &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i \neq 0,\ H^i(X) = 0\} \cong \mathcal{A}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the third axiom for a ''t''-structure, the existence of a certain distinguished triangle, can be made explicit as follows.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is a cochain complex with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  Define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le 0}A^\bullet &amp;= (\cdots \to A^{-2} \to A^{-1} \to \ker d^0 \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots), \\
\tau^{\ge 1}A^\bullet &amp;= (\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to A^0 / \ker d^0 \to A^1 \to A^2 \to \cdots).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It is clear that &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\ge 1}A^\bullet = A^\bullet / \tau^{\le 0}A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; and that there is a short exact sequence of complexes
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \tau^{\le 0} A^\bullet \to A^\bullet \to \tau^{\ge 1} A^\bullet \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This exact sequence furnishes the required distinguished triangle.

This example can be generalized to exact categories (in the sense of Quillen).&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne, 1.3.22.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also similar ''t''-structures for the bounded, bounded above, and bounded below derived categories.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then the full subcategory &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;D(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; consisting of those complexes whose cohomology is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; has a similar ''t''-structure whose heart is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perverse sheaves===
The category of ''[[perverse sheaves]]'' is, by definition, the core of the so-called ''perverse t-structure'' on the derived category of the category of sheaves on a [[complex analytic space]] ''X'' or (working with l-adic sheaves) an [[algebraic variety]] over a finite field. As was explained above, the heart of the standard t-structure simply contains ordinary sheaves, regarded as complexes concentrated in degree 0. For example, the category of perverse sheaves on a (possibly singular) algebraic curve ''X'' (or analogously a possibly singular surface) is designed so that it contains, in particular, objects of the form
:&lt;math&gt;i_* F_Z, j_* F_U[1]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i: Z \to X&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of a point, &lt;math&gt;F_Z&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinary sheaf, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth open subscheme and &lt;math&gt;F_U&lt;/math&gt; is a locally constant sheaf on ''U''. Note the presence of the shift according to the dimension of ''Z'' and ''U'' respectively. This shift causes the category of perverse sheaves to be [[well-behaved]] on singular spaces.  The simple objects in this category are the [[intersection cohomology]] sheaves of subvarieties with coefficients in an irreducible local system.
This t-structure was introduced by Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne.&lt;ref&gt;Beĭlinson, A. A.; Bernstein, J.; Deligne, P. ''Faisceaux pervers.'' Analysis and topology on singular spaces, I (Luminy, 1981),  5–171, Astérisque, 100, Soc. Math. France, Paris, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown by Beilinson that the derived category of the heart &lt;math&gt;D^b(Perv(X))&lt;/math&gt; is in fact equivalent to the original derived category of sheaves. This is an example of the general fact that a triangulated category may be endowed with several distinct t-structures.&lt;ref&gt;Beĭlinson, A. A. ''On the derived category of perverse sheaves.'' K-theory, arithmetic and geometry (Moscow, 1984–1986),  27–41, Lecture Notes in Math., 1289, Springer, Berlin, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graded modules===
A non-standard example of a t-structure on the derived category of (graded) modules over a [[graded ring]] has the property that its heart consists of complexes
:&lt;math&gt;\dots \to P^n \to P^{n+1} \to \dots&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; is a module generated by its (graded) degree ''n''. This t-structure called geometric t-structure plays a prominent role in [[Koszul duality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Alexander; Ginzburg, Victor; Soergel, Wolfgang. ''Koszul duality patterns in representation theory.''  J. Amer. Math. Soc.  9  (1996),  no. 2, 473–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectra===
The category of [[spectrum (topology)|spectra]] is endowed with a t-structure generated, in the sense above, by a single object, namely the [[sphere spectrum]]. The category &lt;math&gt;Sp^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the category of connective spectra, i.e., those whose negative [[homotopy group]]s vanish. (In areas related to homotopy theory, it is common to use homological conventions, as opposed to cohomological ones, so in this case it is common to replace "&lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;" by "&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;". Using this convention, the category of connective spectra the notation is denoted &lt;math&gt;Sp^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.)

===Motives===
A conjectural example in the theory of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motives]] is the so-called ''motivic t-structure''. Its (conjectural) existence is closely related to certain [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]] and vanishing conjectures, such as the [[Beilinson-Soulé conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanamura, Masaki. ''Mixed motives and algebraic cycles. III.''  Math. Res. Lett.  6  (1999),  no. 1, 61–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truncation functors==
In the above example of the natural ''t''-structure on an abelian category, the distinguished triangle guaranteed by the third axiom was constructed by truncation.  As operations on the category of complexes, the truncations &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\le 0}A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\ge 1} A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; are functorial, and the resulting short exact sequence of complexes is natural in &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this, it can be shown that there are truncation functors on the derived category and that they induce a natural distinguished triangle.

In fact, this is an example of a general phenomenon.  While the axioms for a ''t''-structure do not assume the existence of truncation functors, such functors can always be constructed and are essentially unique.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a triangulated category and that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''t''-structure.  The precise statement is that the inclusion functors
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\iota^{\le n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D}^{\le n} \to \mathcal{D}, \\
\iota^{\ge n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n} \to \mathcal{D}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
admit [[adjoint functor|adjoints]].  These are functors
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}^{\le n}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}^{\ge n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\iota^{\le n} \dashv \tau^{\le n}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} \dashv \iota^{\ge n}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
Moreover, for any object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique
:&lt;math&gt;d \in \operatorname{Hom}^1(\tau^{\ge 1} A, \tau^{\le 0} A)&lt;/math&gt;
such that ''d'' and the counit and unit of the adjunctions together define a distinguished triangle
:&lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0} A \to A \to \tau^{\ge 1} A\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \tau^{\le 0} A[1].&lt;/math&gt;
Up to unique isomorphism, this is the unique distinguished triangle of the form &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; objects of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  It follows from the existence of this triangle that an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\ge n+1}(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le n-1}(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;).

The existence of &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; implies the existence of the other truncation functors by shifting and taking opposite categories.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, the third axiom for a ''t''-structure asserts the existence of an &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and a morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to A&lt;/math&gt; fitting into a certain distinguished triangle.  For each &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, fix one such triangle and define &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}(A) = X&lt;/math&gt;.  The axioms for a ''t''-structure imply that, for any object &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(T, X) \cong \operatorname{Hom}(T, A),&lt;/math&gt;
with the isomorphism being induced by the morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to A&lt;/math&gt;.  This exhibits &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a solution to a certain universal mapping problem.  Standard results on adjoint functors now imply that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is unique up to unique isomorphism and that there is a unique way to define &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; on morphisms that makes it a right adjoint.  This proves the existence of &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and hence the existence of all the truncation functors.

Repeated truncation for a ''t''-structure behaves similarly to repeated truncation for complexes.  If &lt;math&gt;n \le m&lt;/math&gt;, then there are natural transformations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le n} &amp;\to \tau^{\le m}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} &amp;\to \tau^{\ge m},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which yield natural equivalences
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le n}\ &amp;\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \tau^{\le n} \circ \tau^{\le m}, \\
\tau^{\ge m}\ &amp;\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \tau^{\ge m} \circ \tau^{\ge n}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} \circ \tau^{\le m} \ &amp;\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \tau^{\le m} \circ \tau^{\ge n}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Cohomology functors==
The ''n''th ''cohomology functor'' &lt;math&gt;H^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H^n = \tau^{\le 0} \circ  \tau^{\ge 0} \circ [n].&lt;/math&gt;
As the name suggests, this is a cohomological functor in the usual sense for a triangulated category.  That is, for any distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to Y \to Z \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a [[long exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \to H^i(X) \to H^i(Y) \to H^i(Z) \to H^{i + 1}(X) \to \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
In applications to algebraic topology, the cohomology functors may be denoted &lt;math&gt;\pi_n&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;H^n&lt;/math&gt;.  The cohomology functors take values in the heart &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\heartsuit&lt;/math&gt;.

For the natural ''t''-structure on a derived category &lt;math&gt;D(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt;, the cohomology functor &lt;math&gt;H^n&lt;/math&gt; is, up to quasi-isomorphism, the usual ''n''th cohomology group of a complex.  However, considered as functors on complexes, this is ''not'' true.  Consider, for example, &lt;math&gt;H^0&lt;/math&gt; as defined in terms of the natural ''t''-structure.  By definition, this is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H^0(A^\bullet)
&amp;= \tau^{\le 0}(\tau^{\ge 0}(A^\bullet)) \\
&amp;= \tau^{\le 0}(\cdots \to 0 \to A^{-1} / \ker d^{-1} \to A^0 \to A^1 \to \cdots) \\
&amp;= (\cdots \to 0 \to A^{-1} / \ker d^{-1} \to \ker d^0 \to 0 \to \cdots).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This complex is non-zero in degrees &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so it is clearly not the same as the zeroth cohomology group of the complex &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the non-trivial differential is an injection, so the only non-trivial cohomology is in degree &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, where it is &lt;math&gt;\ker d^0 / \operatorname{im} d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the zeroth cohomology group of the complex &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows that the two possible definitions of &lt;math&gt;H^0(A^\bullet)&lt;/math&gt; are quasi-isomorphic.

A ''t''-structure is '''non-degenerate''' if the intersection of all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt;, as well as the intersection of all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;, consists only of zero objects.  For a non-degenerate ''t''-structure, the collection of functors &lt;math&gt;\{H^n\}_{n \in \mathbf{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; is conservative.  Moreover, in this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;) may be identified with the full subcategory of those objects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;H^i(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i &gt; n&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;).

==Exact functors==
For &lt;math&gt;i = 1, 2&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_i&lt;/math&gt; be a triangulated category with a fixed ''t''-structure &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_i^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}_i^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt;  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;F \colon \mathcal{D}_1 \to \mathcal{D}_2&lt;/math&gt; is an exact functor (in the usual sense for triangulated categories, that is, up to a natural equivalence it commutes with translation and preserves distinguished triangles).  Then &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is:
* '''Left ''t''-exact''' if &lt;math&gt;F(\mathcal{D}_1^{\ge 0}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}_2^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;,
* '''Right ''t''-exact''' if &lt;math&gt;F(\mathcal{D}_1^{\le 0}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}_2^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;, and
* '''''t''-exact''' if it is both left and right ''t''-exact.

It is elementary to see that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is fully faithful and ''t''-exact, then an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;FA&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_2^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_2^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;).  It is also elementary to see that if &lt;math&gt;G \colon \mathcal{D}_2 \to \mathcal{D}_3&lt;/math&gt; is another left (resp. right) ''t''-exact functor, then the composite &lt;math&gt;G \circ F&lt;/math&gt; is also left (resp. right) ''t''-exact.

The motivation for the study of one-sided ''t''-exactness properties is that they lead to one-sided exactness properties on hearts.  Let &lt;math&gt;\iota_i^\heartsuit \colon \mathcal{D}_i^\heartsuit \to \mathcal{D}_i&lt;/math&gt; be the inclusion.  Then there is a composite functor
:&lt;math&gt;{}^pF = H^0 \circ F \circ \iota_1^\heartsuit \colon \mathcal{D}_1^\heartsuit \to \mathcal{D}_2^\heartsuit.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is left (resp. right) exact, then &lt;math&gt;{}^pF&lt;/math&gt; is also left (resp. right) exact, and that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is also left (resp. right) exact, then &lt;math&gt;{}^p(G \circ F) = ({}^pG) \circ F&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is left (resp. right) ''t''-exact, and if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;), then there is a natural isomorphism &lt;math&gt;{}^pF(H^0A)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ H^0F(A)&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;H^0F(A)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ {}^pF(H^0A)&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;(T^*, T_*) \colon \mathcal{D}_1 \leftrightarrows \mathcal{D}_2&lt;/math&gt; are exact functors with &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; left adjoint to &lt;math&gt;T_*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is right ''t''-exact if and only if &lt;math&gt;T_*&lt;/math&gt; is left ''t''-exact, and in this case, &lt;math&gt;({}^pT^*, {}^pT_*)&lt;/math&gt; are a pair of adjoint functors &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1^\heartsuit \leftrightarrows \mathcal{D}_2^\heartsuit&lt;/math&gt;.

==Constructions of ''t''-structures==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; be a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  If ''n'' is an integer, then the '''translation by ''n''''' ''t''-structure is &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le n}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge n})&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''dual ''t''-structure''' is the ''t''-structure on the [[opposite category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;((\mathcal{D}^{\le 0})^\text{op}, (\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})^\text{op})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; be a triangulated subcategory of a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;((\mathcal{D}')^{\le 0}, (\mathcal{D}')^{\ge 0}) = (\mathcal{D}' \cap \mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}' \cap \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt;
is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; is stable under the truncation functor &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  When this condition holds, the ''t''-structure &lt;math&gt;((\mathcal{D}')^{\le 0}, (\mathcal{D}')^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''induced ''t''-structure'''.  The truncation and cohomology functors for the induced ''t''-structure are the restriction to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; of those on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently the inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is ''t''-exact, and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}')^\heartsuit = \mathcal{D}^\heartsuit \cap \mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt;.

To construct the category of perverse sheaves, it is important to be able to define a ''t''-structure on a category of sheaves over a space by working locally in that space.  The precise conditions necessary for this to be possible can be abstracted somewhat to the following setup.  Suppose that there are three triangulated categories and two morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_F\ \stackrel{i_*}{\to}\ \mathcal{D}\ \stackrel{j^*}{\to}\ \mathcal{D}_U&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the following properties.
* There are two sequences of triples of adjoint functors &lt;math&gt;(j_!, j^*, j_*)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(i^*, i_*, i^!)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The functors &lt;math&gt;i_*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j_!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;j^*&lt;/math&gt; are full and faithful, and they satisfy &lt;math&gt;j^*i_* = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* There are unique differentials making, for every ''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, exact triangles
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j_!j^*K &amp;\to K \to i_*i^*K \to j_!j^*K[1], \\
i_*i^!K &amp;\to K \to i_*i^*K \to i_*i^!K[1].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, given ''t''-structures &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_U^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}_U^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_F^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}_F^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_F&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, there is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^{\le 0} &amp;= \{ K \in \mathcal{D} \colon j^*K \in \mathcal{D}_U^{\le 0},\ i^*K \in \mathcal{D}_F^{\le 0}\}, \\
\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0} &amp;= \{ K \in \mathcal{D} \colon j^*K \in \mathcal{D}_U^{\ge 0},\ i^*K \in \mathcal{D}_F^{\ge 0}\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This ''t''-structure is said to be the '''gluing''' of the ''t''-structures on ''U'' and ''F''.  The intended use cases are when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_U&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_F&lt;/math&gt; are bounded below derived categories of sheaves on a space ''X'', an open subset ''U'', and the closed complement ''F'' of ''U''.  The functors &lt;math&gt;j^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_*&lt;/math&gt; are the usual pullback and pushforward functors.  This works, in particular, when the sheaves in question are left modules over a sheaf of rings &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'' and when the sheaves are ℓ-adic sheaves.

Many t-structures arise by means of the following fact: in a triangulated category with arbitrary [[direct sum]]s, and a set &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; of [[compact object (category theory)|compact objects]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, the subcategories
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1} &amp;= \{X \in \mathcal{D} \colon \operatorname{Hom}(S_0[-n], X) = 0, n \ge 0\}, \\
\mathcal{D}^{\le 0} &amp;= \{Y \in \mathcal{D} \colon \operatorname{Hom}(Y, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}) = 0\},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
can be shown to be a t-structure.&lt;ref&gt;Beligiannis, Apostolos; Reiten, Idun. ''Homological and homotopical aspects of torsion theories.''  Mem. Amer. Math. Soc.  188  (2007),  no. 883, viii+207 pp. Theorem III.2.3&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ''t''-structure is said to be '''generated by &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;'''.

Given an abelian subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to construct a subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and a ''t''-structure on that subcategory whose heart is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne, proposition 1.3.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
If the requirement &lt;math&gt;D^{\le 0}\subset D^{\le 1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D^{\ge 1}\subset D^{\ge 0};&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the opposite inclusion
:&lt;math&gt;D^{\le 0}\supset D^{\le 1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D^{\ge 1}\supset D^{\ge 0},&lt;/math&gt;
and the other two axioms kept the same, the resulting notion is called a ''co-t-structure'' or ''weight structure''.&lt;ref&gt;Bondarko, M. V. ''Weight structures vs. t-structures; weight filtrations, spectral sequences, and complexes (for motives and in general).''  J. K-Theory  6  (2010),  no. 3, 387–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">'''Trading Blows'', or'' Trading licks'', or '''- blows, - shots'', etc., is an endurance test in which the participants (usually two [[boy]]s or young men) take turns, alternating between administering a blow to an opponent and assuming the agreed exposed position (e.g. bending over an object or grabbing the ankles) to endure the next one, using the same implement (e.g. a [[fraternity paddle]]), until only the winner can still bring himself to endure the gradually increasing pain in the progressively tormented target part of their anatomy (usually the posterior, in which case it is a form of [[spanking]], or the cheeks), which in the interest of fairness should be either bared or only covered by a common uniform. As the blows are not given by the same person but by the parties themselves, the strongest-armed one actually has an unfair (but not always decisive) physical advantage.

Such rather [[macho]] displays of willpower, restraining the instinct to avoid pain, can serve various purposes, including:
*a [[physical punishment]], especially for quarreling, possibly the origin of the practice (this ritualized alternative to a more disabling or even lethal [[duel]] should also make its participants realize the futility of physical aggression)
*a motivation test, especially as part of an initiation process, such as [[hazing]]
*an obedience test, as in certain [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle game]]s (possibly really an excuse for the rather sadistic amusement of the seniors)
*a duel, either personal or as champions representing similar, especially rivaling, groups; in certain fraternities, refusing such a challenge may result in exclusion from the membership, even for an alumnus
*as a game, either to 'proudly' display one's tenacity (often to impress some audience) or in the pursuit of a sadist and/or masochistic, erotic or pain-addicted, kick.
*as a [[sexual fetish]]

Another game with the same name is often played among boys or young men, where two people agree on a place to hit the other (e.g. the shoulder or chest) and the two take turns trading punches until one person cannot stand the pain any longer. The first person to give up is the loser.

[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]], with writing in three different scripts, was instrumental in deciphering Ancient Egyptian.]]

'''Writing''' is a medium of human [[communication]] that represents [[language]] and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or [[spoken language]]. Writing is not a language, but a [[tool]] used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]], and [[semantics]], with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called ''text'', and the recipient of text is called a ''reader''. Motivations for writing include [[publication]], [[storytelling]], correspondence, [[record keeping]] and [[diary]]. Writing has been instrumental in keeping [[history]], maintaining [[culture]], dissemination of knowledge through the [[Mass media|media]] and the formation of [[legal systems]].

As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in [[Mesopotamia]] outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}} In both [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.

== Means of recording information ==
[[H.G. Wells]] argued that writing has the ability to "put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =A Short History of the World |first=H. G. |last=Wells |year=1922 |page=41|title-link=A Short History of the World (H. G. Wells) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main article|Writing system}}
[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alphabet]]ic writing is a frequent category in [[human communication]]. ]]
The major [[writing system]]s—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories: [[logographic]], [[Syllable|syllabic]], [[alphabetic]], [[featural]], and [[ideographic]] (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, [[pictographic]], is insufficient to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.

====Logographies====
A [[logogram]] is a written character which represents a word or [[morpheme]]. A vast number of logograms are needed to write [[Chinese characters]], [[cuneiform]], and [[Mayan script|Mayan]], where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—("logoconsonantal" in the case of hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese "radicals", hieroglyphic "determiners"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for "fin", pronounced "ka", was also used to represent the syllable "ka" whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (meaning) element called a ''radical'' with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a ''phonetic''. However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.

The main logographic system in use today is [[Chinese characters]], used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of [[languages of China|China]], [[languages of Japan|Japan]], and sometimes in [[Korean language|Korean]] despite the fact that in [[South Korea|South]] and [[North Korea]], the phonetic [[Hangul]] system is mainly used.

====Syllabaries====
A [[syllabary]] is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s. A glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel, or just a vowel alone, though in some scripts more complex syllables (such as consonant-vowel-consonant, or consonant-consonant-vowel) may have dedicated glyphs. Phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script. For instance, the syllable "ka" may look nothing like the syllable "ki", nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. Other languages that use syllabic writing include the [[Linear B]] script for [[Mycenaean Greek]]; [[Cherokee]]; [[Ndyuka language|Ndjuka]], an English-based [[creole language]] of [[Surinam]]; and the [[Vai language|Vai]] script of [[Liberia]]. Most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component. [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]], though technically an [[abugida]], has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary.

====Alphabets====
{{See also|History of the alphabet}}

An [[alphabet]] is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly [[phonology|phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.

As languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

=====Abjads=====
In most of the writing systems of the Middle East, it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written, although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks. Writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Such systems are called ''[[abjad]]s'', derived from the Arabic word for "alphabet".

=====Abugidas=====
In most of the alphabets of India and Southeast Asia, vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant. These are called ''[[abugida]]s''. Some abugidas, such as [[Ethiopic]] and [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree]], are learned by children as syllabaries, and so are often called "syllabics". However, unlike true syllabaries, there is not an independent glyph for each syllable.

Sometimes the term "alphabet" is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels, such as the [[Latin alphabet]], although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets. Because of this use, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] is often considered to be the first alphabet.

====Featural scripts====
A featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips ("labial" sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters "b" and "p"; however, labial "m" is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking "q" and "d" are not labial. In Korean [[hangul]], however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed.

Another featural script is [[SignWriting]], the most popular writing system for many [[sign languages]], where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented [[secular icon|iconically]]. Featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tengwar]].

====Historical significance of writing systems====
[[Image:Olin-Warner-LoC-tympanum-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] representing Writing, above exterior of main entrance doors, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington DC, 1896.]]

Historians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history, with history defined by the advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing, but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.

Writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation, and meaning of individual signs changes over time. By tracing the development of a script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time.

===Tools and materials===
{{See also|writing implements}}
The many tools and writing materials used throughout history include [[stone tablet]]s, [[clay tablet]]s, bamboo slats, [[papyrus]], [[wax tablet]]s, [[vellum]], [[parchment]], [[paper]], [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], [[stylus]]es, [[quill]]s, [[ink brush]]es, [[pencil]]s, [[pen]]s, and many styles of [[lithography]]. The Incas used knotted cords known as [[quipu]] (or khipu) for keeping records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/index.html|title=The Khipu Database Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[typewriter]] and various forms of [[word processor]]s have subsequently become widespread writing tools, and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
{{Main article|Proto-writing|History of writing}}

===Neolithic writing===
[[File:Tărtăria Amulet.png|thumb|250px|Amulet of the [[Tărtăria tablets]], the earliest found example of the [[Old European script]] and of human writing in the world generally, dating to 5500–5300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, Harald (2002). ''Geschichte der Schrift'', C.H. Beck, {{ISBN|3-406-47998-7}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is a product of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] that was in [[Romania]] and neighbouring regions.]]

By definition, the modern practice of [[history]] begins with written records. Evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of [[prehistory]]. The [[Dispilio Tablet]] (Greece), [[Jiahu symbols]] (China) and [[Tărtăria tablets]] (Romania), which have been carbon dated to the [[6th millennium BC]], are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings.

===Mesopotamia===
While neolithic writing is a current research topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East. Writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining financial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}}

[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Globular envelope with a cluster of accountancy tokens, Uruk period, from [[Susa]]. [[Louvre Museum]]]]

Archaeologist [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat]] determined the link between previously uncategorized clay "tokens", the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, [[Mesopotamian]] [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref name="Rudgley"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age| last=Rudgley| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Rudgley| year=2000| pages=48–57| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added "a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols".

The original [[Mesopotamian]] writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing, Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' pp. 381–383&lt;/ref&gt; the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers. This system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of [[pictographs]]. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but by the 29th century BC also for phonetic elements. Around 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonia]]n) around 2600 BC, and then to others such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]. With the adoption of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as the 'lingua franca' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.

===Elamite scripts===
Over the centuries, three distinct Elamite scripts developed.
[[Proto-Elamite]] is the oldest known writing system from Iran. In use only for a brief time (c. 3200–2900 BC), clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is thought to have developed from early [[cuneiform]] (proto-cuneiform). The Proto-Elamite script consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly [[logogram|logographic]].

[[Linear Elamite]] is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in Iran. It was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, although this cannot be proven since Linear-Elamite has not been deciphered. Several scholars have attempted to decipher the script, most notably [[:de:Walther Hinz|Walther Hinz]] and [[:it:Piero Meriggi|Piero Meriggi]].

The [[Elamite cuneiform]] script was used from about 2500 to 331 BC, and was adapted from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]. The Elamite cuneiform script consisted of about 130 symbols, far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts.

====Cretan and Greek scripts====
{{Further information|Cretan hieroglyphs|Linear A|Linear B}}

[[Cretan hieroglyphs]] are found on artifacts of [[Crete]] (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). [[Linear B]], the writing system of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]],&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."/&gt; has been deciphered while [[Linear A]] has yet to be deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."&gt;{{harvnb|Olivier|1986|pp=377f.}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name group="A"&gt;Beginning date refers to first attestations, the assumed origins of all scripts lie further back in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the [[Aegean Islands]] ([[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Cythera (island)|Kythera]], [[Milos|Melos]], [[Santorini|Thera]]), and the [[Greek mainland]] ([[Laconia]]) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete ([[Knossos]]), and mainland ([[Pylos]], [[Mycenae]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tiryns]]) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.

===China===
{{Further information|Oracle bone script|Bronzeware script}}

The earliest surviving examples of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called "[[oracle bone]]s", tortoise [[plastron]]s and ox [[scapula]]e used for divination—date from around 1200 BC in the late [[Shang dynasty]]. A small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historians have found that the type of [[Media (arts)|media]] used had an effect on what the writing was documenting and how it was used.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 2003, archaeologists reported discoveries of [[Jiahu symbols|isolated tortoise-shell carvings]] dating back to the 7th millennium BC, but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|196px|thumbnail|right|[[Narmer Palette]], with the two serpopards representing unification of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], [[3000 B.C.|3000 B. C.]]]]
The earliest known [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are the [[Narmer Palette]], dating to c. 3200 BC, and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older, though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition. The hieroglyphic script was [[logogram|logographic]] with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|alphabet]].

Writing was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of [[scribe]]s. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.

The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] appears to have been developed by Canaanite turquoise miners in the Sinai desert around the mid-19th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwasser, Orly. "How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs", Biblical Archaeology Review, Mar/Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous Egyptian mining site known as Serabit el-Khadem. This site was also home to a temple of Hathor, the "Mistress of turquoise". A later, two line inscription has also been found at Wadi el-Hol in Central Egypt. Based on [[hieroglyph]]ic prototypes, but also including entirely new symbols, each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word: the basis of an alphabetic system. It was not until the 12th to 9th centuries, however, that the alphabet took hold and became widely used.

===Indus Valley===
{{Main article|Indus script}}

Indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (which spanned modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]]) used between 2600 and 1900 BC. In spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims, it is as yet undeciphered. The term 'Indus script' is mainly applied to that used in the mature Harappan phase, which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early [[Harappa]] after 3500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, David (1999). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm 'Earliest writing' found]" BBC&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by the mature Harappan script. The script is written from right to left,&lt;ref&gt;(Lal 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes follows a [[boustrophedonic]] style. Since the number of principal signs is about 400–600,&lt;ref&gt;(Wells 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts, many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic&lt;ref&gt;(Bryant 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically syllabic scripts have about 50–100 signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs). Several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an [[agglutinative]] language underlies the script.

===Central Asia===
In 2001, archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in [[Central Asia]] that used writing c. 2000 BC. An excavation near [[Ashgabat]], the capital of [[Turkmenistan]], revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient writing found in Turkmenistan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1330705.stm |quote=A previously unknown civilisation was using writing in Central Asia 4,000 years ago, hundreds of years before Chinese writing developed, archaeologists have discovered. An excavation near Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that seems to have been used as a stamp seal. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenician writing system and descendants===
The [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script, in which [[Proto-Canaanite]] is believed to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The [[Phoenician script|Phoenician writing system]] was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from [[Hieratic]], [[Cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. This writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greeks]], who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The [[Cumae alphabet]], a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and its own descendants, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Rune]]s. Other descendants from the [[Greek alphabet]] include [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used to write [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the [[Aramaic script]], from which the [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic script]]s are descended.

The [[Tifinagh]] script (Berber languages) is descended from the Libyco-Berber script, which is assumed to be of Phoenician origin.

===Mesoamerica===
A stone slab with 3,000-year-old writing, known as the [[Cascajal Block]], was discovered in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]] and is an example of the oldest script in the Western Hemisphere, preceding the oldest [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] writing by approximately 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |authorlink=John Noble Wilford |title=Writing May Be Oldest in Western Hemisphere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/15writing.html |quote=A stone slab bearing 3,000-year-old writing previously unknown to scholars has been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and archaeologists say it is an example of the oldest script ever discovered in the Western Hemisphere. |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Briggs |title='Oldest' New World writing found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5347080.stm |quote=Ancient civilisations in Mexico developed a writing system as early as 900 BC, new evidence suggests. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oldest Writing in the New World |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5793/1610 |first=Maria del Carmen |last=Rodríguez Martínez |display-authors=etal |year=2006 |volume=313 |issue=5793 |pages=1610–1614 |doi=10.1126/science.1131492 |pmid=16973873 |quote=A block with a hitherto unknown system of writing has been found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico. Stylistic and other dating of the block places it in the early first millennium before the common era, the oldest writing in the New World, with features that firmly assign this pivotal development to the Olmec civilization of Mesoamerica. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |accessdate=30 March 2008 |bibcode=2006Sci...313.1610R }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be [[Olmec]].

Of several [[pre-Columbian]] scripts in [[Mesoamerica]], the one that appears to have been best developed, and the only one to be deciphered, is the [[Maya script]]. The earliest inscription identified as Maya dates to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Saturno2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saturno|first=William A.|author2=David Stuart |author3=Boris Beltrán |title=Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala|journal=Science|date=3 March 2006|volume=311|issue=5765|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1126/science.1121745|pmid=16400112|bibcode=2006Sci...311.1281S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya writing used logograms complemented by a set of syllabic glyphs, somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing.

===South America===
The [[Incas]] had no known script. Their [[quipu]] system of recording information—based on knots tied along one or many linked cords—was apparently used for inventory and accountancy purposes and could not encode textual information.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Dacia===
Three stone slabs were found by Romanian archaeologist [[Nicolae Vlassa]], in the mid-20th century (1961) in [[Tărtăria]] (present-day [[Alba County]], [[Transylvania]]), [[Romania]], ancient land of [[Dacia]], inhabited by Dacians, which were a population who may have been related to the [[Getae]]s and [[Thracians]].
One of the slabs contains 4 groups of pictographs divided by lines. Some of the characters are also found in Ancient [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], as well as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] and [[Iberian scripts|Iberian]].
The origin and the timing of the writings are disputed, because there are no precise evidence [[in situ]], the slabs cannot be carbon dated, because of the bad treatment of the [[Cluj]] museum. There are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs, that certifies the 5300–5500 BC period.

==Modern importance==
In the 21st century, writing has become an important part of daily life as [[technology]] has connected individuals from across the globe through systems such as [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. [[Literacy]] has grown in importance as a factor for success in the modern world. In the United States, the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the [[writing center]] and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their [[socioeconomic status]].

Other parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the [[World Literacy Foundation]] and [[International Literacy Foundation]], as well as a general push for increased global communication.
