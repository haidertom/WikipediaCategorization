'''Adventures in Preservation''', formerly named Heritage Conservation Network, is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to safeguarding the world’s architectural heritage. Its programs give volunteers from all walks of life the opportunity to be involved in preservation in a variety of hands-on ways.

== Overview ==

Adventures in Preservation (AiP) is a non-profit organization revolving around “Heritage Travel with Purpose”. AiP connects people and preservation through hands-on programs that safeguard cultural heritage and foster community sustainability. AiP travelers have the opportunity to travel, experience their destination, and learn hands-on skills from experts while assisting communities in a meaningful way.

AiP organizes a series of hands-on building conservation workshops and [[volunteer vacations]]. Working in locations around the world, participants support community-based preservation projects, such as restoring houses to create [[affordable housing]]. The workshops are meaningful opportunities to give back while learning about preservation in general, as well as specific building conservation techniques.

Each workshop is led by a technical expert, who teaches and guides volunteers as they work. Participation is open to all, from teens to active retirees. Since its founding in 2001, Adventures in Preservation has worked in a half-dozen countries, including Albania, Slovenia, Mexico, Italy, Ghana, and the United States. Many other projects are in development. Requests for assistance come directly from people involved at the [[Grassroots democracy|grass-roots]] level, and projects are put onto a wait list.

== Global impact and recognition ==
Numerous examples have shown that AiP’s volunteer efforts are a major catalyst for conservation. AiP volunteers have played a key role in restoration projects at the Francis Mill in [[Waynesville, North Carolina]]; the Weisel Bridge, [[Quakertown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Manor house|Manor House]] in Oplotnica, Slovenia; the gardens of [[Bartow-Pell Mansion|the Bartow-Pell Mansion]] Museum, [[The Bronx|The Bronx, New York]]; and adobe residences in [[Mesilla, New Mexico]].

They have also been involved in restoration efforts at the Jean (Jacob) Hasbrouck House, [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz, New York]]; the Monastery of {{Interlanguage link multi|San Giovanni Battista, Serravalle|it|3=Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista (Vittorio Veneto)|lt=San Giovanni Battista}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto|it|3=Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto)|lt=Serravalle}}, [[Vittorio Veneto]], Italy; a [[shotgun house]] in Cairo, Illinois; the Chief’s House in Ablekuma, Ghana; and missions in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua, Mexico]]. AiP also organized crews of volunteers in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], to help clean up in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

AiP volunteers restore more than buildings. They restore people's lives, their communities, and their pride in their heritage. The workshops also contribute variously to [[heritage tourism]], [[economic development]], and job training initiatives.

The organization and its volunteers have received awards for their efforts at Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum and their emergency stabilization work at the James Brown House and Farm Ooltehwah, Tennessee.

== Workshops ==
AiP adventures have always provided you a great educational experience, with hands-on training and excursions designed to highlight the essence of each country’s culture. AiP offers six to eight workshops each year. As with most [[volunteer travel]] programs, there is a fee for participating. This fee covers lodging, most meals, insurance, instructions, and a contribution towards the cost of conservation work and [[building material]]s. Current workshop offerings are listed on their website.

"Jammers" is a special term for the people who travel with AiP to explore and help restore the world's cultural heritage, because they are so much more than volunteers or participants. To make a long story short, "jammers" comes from an early misunderstanding that Adventures in Preservation worked with jam and jelly, as in strawberry and other fruit preserves. An interesting possibility, but not so. It represents the way a group of musicians, or other groups, come together to jam and create something new and wonderful.

'''''American Gangster''''' is a 2007 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[crime film]] directed and produced by [[Ridley Scott]] and written by [[Steven Zaillian]]. The film is fictionally based on the criminal career of [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]], a gangster from [[La Grange, North Carolina]] who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the [[Vietnam War]], before being detained by a task force led by detective [[Richie Roberts]]. The film stars [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]] in their first lead acting roles together since 1995's ''[[Virtuosity]]''. The film also co-stars [[Ted Levine]], [[John Ortiz]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Norman Reedus]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Lymari Nadal]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]

Development for the film initially began in 2000, when [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story about the rise and fall of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] introduced a 170-page [[scriptment]] to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in [[Toronto]] for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with [[Terry George]], it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout [[New York City]] and concluded in [[Thailand]].

''American Gangster'' premiered in New York on October 20, 2007, and was released in the United States and Canada on November 2. The film was well received by most film critics, and grossed over US$266.5 million worldwide, with domestic grosses standing at $130.1 million. Many of the people portrayed, including Roberts and Lucas, have stated that the film took a lot of creative license with the story, and three former [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents sued Universal claiming the agency's portrayal was demoralizing. ''American Gangster'' was nominated for twenty-one awards, including two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Ruby Dee), and won three including a [[14th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Dee.

==Plot==
In 1968, [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]] is the right-hand man of [[Harlem]] gangster [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]]. When Johnson dies of a heart attack, Lucas takes control of the Harlem crime scene.

After handing in almost $1 million that he found in a mobster's car, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] detective [[Richie Roberts]] is ostracized in his precinct. After his exiled and addicted partner overdoses on a potent brand of  [[heroin]] called "Blue Magic", Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a task force  that targets local suppliers. Lucas buys Blue Magic directly from producers in Thailand and smuggles it into the U.S. through returning [[Vietnam War]] servicemen. His low overhead allows him to eventually wholesale Blue Magic to most of the dealers in the New York area. With this monopoly, Lucas expands his control to nightclubs, casinos, and prostitution. He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers, including Huey and Turner, as lieutenants to spread his empire. During his rise to becoming Harlem's crime boss, Lucas falls in love with Eva, a Puerto Rican beauty queen.

As Lucas' business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the [[Fight of the Century]] with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]] boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure [[Nicky Barnes]], a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the [[Fall of Saigon]] cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.

Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' cousin and driver shoot a woman and then use the threat of a long sentence to get him to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]]. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized [[Shelby Mustang]] Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.

In the police station, Lucas offers to bribe Roberts, but is rebuffed. Instead, Roberts offers Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, three quarters of the New York [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, having just passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.

[[File:Russell Crowe TIFF 2006.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Russell Crowe]] (pictured here in 2006) worked with director Ridley Scott on the film's script.|alt=Russell Crowe in a premiere.]]
In 2000, [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to "The Return of Superfly", a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story by [[Mark Jacobson]] about the rise and fall of the 1970s heroin kingpin Frank Lucas.&lt;ref name="fame"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Kleinknecht, William | title=FROM FOES TO FRIENDS AND NOW ON TO FAME | work=[[The Star-Ledger]] | date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] brought a 170-page script to director [[Ridley Scott]], who expressed interest in making two films from it. However, Scott did not immediately pursue the project, choosing to make ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' instead. In November 2003, Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with [[Brian De Palma]] to direct ''Tru Blu'', with a script by Zaillian based on Frank Lucas.&lt;ref name="re-imagined"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117895211.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title=U is re-Imagined | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=November 5, 2003 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20154184,00.html|title=Clash of the Titans|first=Josh|last=Rottenberg |date=October 25, 2007 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaillian interpreted the story as one of "American business and race", focusing the script thematically on corporate business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Leland, John |authorlink=John Leland (journalist) | title=Gross National Product |work=The New York Times | date=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was initially slated for a spring 2004 start.&lt;ref name="re-imagined" /&gt; In March 2004, the studio entered new negotiations with [[Antoine Fuqua]] to direct, as well as [[Denzel Washington]] to star in the film as Frank Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Snyder, Gabriel |author2=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901768.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 | title='Tru Blu' has liftoff at Imagine | work=Variety | date=March 15, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following May, [[Benicio del Toro]] entered negotiations to star as Detective Richie Roberts, who brought down Lucas.

Universal Pictures reported that it greenlit ''American Gangster'' with a budget of $80&amp;nbsp;million, which escalated to $93&amp;nbsp;million, with $10&amp;nbsp;million for development costs and $3&amp;nbsp;million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93&amp;nbsp;million from the beginning. The studio also sought for ''American Gangster'' to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company [[General Electric]] received [[tax credit]]s in New York City, so production was moved to the city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98&amp;nbsp;million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as [[Ray Liotta]] and [[John C. Reilly]] in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.&lt;ref name=wrap&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca |author2=Jeff Jensen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,724273,00.html |title='Gangster' Wrap |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 22, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115130416/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C724273%2C00.html |archivedate=November 15, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, ''American Gangster'' was revived as Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with [[Terry George]] to revise Zaillian's script and direct the film, which was to be financed with a target budget of US $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117919334.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=U's still high on 'Gangster' | work=Variety | date=March 13, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Smith]] was approached to replace Washington as Frank Lucas, though an offer would be held off until George completed his revision of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117923659.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 | title=Thesp's 'American' dream | work=Variety | date=May 30, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George cut many key scenes, characters and Asian locations to reduce costs, but the project failed to progress given financial problems and Grazer feeling they "couldn't make it right" without the removed material.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=daily/&gt;

After a meeting between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided he was ready to do it. Producer [[Brian Grazer]] and Imagine executive Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision.&lt;ref name="going"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940290.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title=U gets going on 'Gangster' | work=Variety | date=March 23, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, [[Ridley Scott]] entered talks with the studio to take over ''American Gangster'' from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis.

Scott had discussed the script with Crowe as they worked on ''A Good Year'' in France, and they sought to take on the project. The director reviewed Zaillian's script, Terry George's rewrite, and a revision by [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] during the project's incarnation with director Antoine Fuqua. Scott preferred Zaillian's approach and chose to follow it. In realizing the project, the director encountered a challenge in the script since the characters Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts do not encounter each other until twenty minutes before the end of the film. The director sought to flesh out the private universes of the characters that would evolve and have scenes cut between the two characters to provide a balance. Elements like Frank Lucas's interaction with his family and Richie Roberts' dysfunctional marriage were written to add to the characters' backgrounds.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{Cite news | author=Douglas, Edward | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=38623 | title= Ridley Scott's ''American Gangster'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=October 25, 2007 | accessdate=November 3, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071027024412/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=38623| archivedate= October 27, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rappers [[T.I.]], [[Rza|RZA]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] were added to the cast to appeal to younger audiences.&lt;ref name=jay /&gt;

Scott chose to direct ''American Gangster'' based on the paradoxical values of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The film somewhat focuses on the comparatively ethical business practices of the "wicked gangster" and the womanizing and failed marriage of the "do-gooder" police detective. Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw "the arc of the character" had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions.&lt;ref name="fame" /&gt; To prepare for their roles, the actors met their real-life counterparts. Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's manner of speaking and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation.&lt;ref name="fame" /&gt; The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for ''American Gangster''.&lt;ref name="going" /&gt; It was rumored that Washington got paid another $20&amp;nbsp;million for when the project was greenlit again; that rumor proved to be false, as he signed on for his gross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/10/american-gangst.html |title=American Gangster: A Grazer Tale |author=Thompson, Anne |work=Thompson on Hollywood |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=Oct 17, 2007 |quote=Denzel Washington had already gotten paid his upfront guarantee pay-or-play, so he signed on just for his gross. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107134457/http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/10/american-gangst.html |archivedate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget had escalated to $100 million, which Grazer stated was unexpected given "It's not a [[high-concept]] comedy, it's not a fantasy movie, it's not a [[four-quadrant movie]]".&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Grazer and Scott still had to pay back the studio $3 million for a [[cost overrun|budget overrun]].&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/15/business/fi-gangster15/|title='Gangster' gets a shot|date=October 15, 2007|first=Claudia|last=Eller|website=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Image:Bknavyard.JPG|thumb|left|Principal photography took place in several location throughout New York, including the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].|alt=Panoramic view of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.]]
[[Principal photography]] began in July 2006 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{Cite web | author=Whipp, Glenn | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NOT+MAKING+IT+WOULD+BE+A+CRIME+'AMERICAN+GANGSTER'+OVERCOMES+MORE...-a0170398415| title=NOT MAKING IT WOULD BE A CRIME 'AMERICAN GANGSTER' OVERCOMES MORE OBSTACLES THAN MOST HOLLYWOOD DRAMAS| website=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]| date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=November 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Gangster'' was filmed over a period of approximately four months in over 180 different locations, most of them across New York; it set the record for containing the highest number of filming locations of a movie.&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; Two months were spent in New York, with all the city's [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] being used. Approximately fifty to sixty locations were set in Harlem alone. While in the neighbourhood, Scott stated that he found several interiors that had been untouched since the 1940s.&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; According to production designer Arthur Max, exhaustive [[location scouting]] was done to find parts of New York that could still resemble the city of the early 1970s, filming Lucas' headquarters at [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] 20 blocks north, on 136th Street.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2007/american_gangster_production_details.htm |title=''American Gangster'' Production Notes |website=Universal Pictures |accessdate=November 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113144/http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2007/american_gangster_production_details.htm |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interview with [[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]], Scott stated that "[he] just walked in [...] and [...] just sho[o]t in the house." Several [[gas mask]]s were brought by producers due to health hazards and sanitary concerns existing in the buildings. Scott found filming in Harlem to be difficult, commenting that the rapid [[gentrification]] in Harlem provided poor opportunities for shooting angles.&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; [[Hand-held camera]]s were extensively used to depict a "[[guerrilla filmmaking]]" style.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Other locations for principal photography include the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], [[Old Westbury Gardens]], a segment of the [[George Washington Bridge]], and the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Brooklyn Supreme Courthouse]]. [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] had the locations for both the Lucas farm and the estate Lucas buys for his family.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Filming locations began setting up in [[Thailand]] in November 2006, after [[Branko Lustig]] consulted with Suvit Yodmanee, the country's tourism minister.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/1/movies/15833311&amp;sec=movies |title=Thailand beckons |website=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |publisher=Star Publications |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=November 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614040826/http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F1%2Fmovies%2F15833311&amp;sec=movies |archivedate=June 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for ''American Gangster'' concluded in [[Chiang Mai]] the following month.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Using his experience from visiting New York in the same time period in which the film's story took place, Scott sought to downplay a "[[The Beatles|Beatles]]" atmosphere to the film and to instead create a shabbier atmosphere, saying that "Harlem was really, really shabby, beautiful [[brownstone]]s falling apart."&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; Production and costume design was emphasized, transforming the location into the rundown streets of upper Manhattan from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Denzel Washington, as Frank Lucas, went through 64 different costume changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Schwartz, Robert | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963680.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title='Gangster' puts hit on gentrification | work=Variety | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
In 2006, [[Greg Calloway]] was approached by producers to produce a soundtrack for the film. He presented the idea to [[Atlantic Records]] chairman [[Craig Kallman]], and one of the company's artists, [[T.I.]], got an acting role in the film. However, the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures owned the rights to the film; "It was a Universal film and they were not going to give the soundtrack to [[Warner Music Group|WMG]]" (Atlantic's parent company).&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregcalloway.wordpress.com/bio/|title=Who Is Who is Greg Calloway?|publisher=Greg Calloway's official website|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Scott brought back [[Marc Streitenfeld]], who had worked with him in ''A Good Year''. The composer stated that "the overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker" given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of [[blues]] and [[soul music]] to fit the 1970s setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/soundtracks/INTERVIEW-Marc-Streitenfeld-7411.html|publisher=Cinema Blend|title=INTERVIEW - Marc Streitenfeld|first=Scott|last=Gwin|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical score for ''American Gangster'' was recorded between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself. Additional score material was composed and recorded by [[Hank Shocklee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Goldwasser, Dan | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/87/ | title=Marc Streitenfeld scores Ridley Scott's ''American Gangster'' | publisher=ScoringSessions.com| date=May 15, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official soundtrack album for ''American Gangster'' was released by [[Def Jam Recordings]] within a week of the film's release. In addition to Streitenfeld and Shocklee's score material, the soundtrack album also features songs influenced by music in the 1960s and 1970s, including from blues and soul musicians such as [[Bobby Womack]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Sam &amp; Dave]], and [[John Lee Hooker]].&lt;ref name=jay&gt;{{Cite news|author=Halbinger, David M. |author2=Leeds, Jeff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/arts/music/20jayz.html |title=For Jay-Z, Inspiration Arrives in a Movie |work=The New York Times |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207172627/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/arts/music/20jayz.html |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazer stated that "I wanted to introduce a visual and sonic world that is a contained entity of the '70s", and Scott felt it was vital to have "the brand of music that was Harlem at the time."&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Denzel Washington pressed Grazer into inviting rapper [[Jay-Z]] to write the film's score, but the producer "just didn't think there'd be enough for Jay-Z to do" given the intentions to do a soundtrack filled with 1970s music.&lt;ref name=jay /&gt; The film's trailer had already used Jay-Z's "Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)", and the rapper was invited to an advanced screening. The film had a profound resonance on the musician, who decided to create a concept album, also entitled ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]''.&lt;ref name=notes /&gt; The rapper recorded tracks that were prompted by specific scenes in the film. It was speculated that the album's release in conjunction with the film would attract a young audience and help Universal Pictures generate profits to recover from the film's troubled development history.&lt;ref name=jay /&gt; According to Jay-Z: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was like I was watching the film, and putting it on pause, and giving a back story to the story. It immediately clicked with me. Like ''Scarface'' or any one of those films, you take the good out of it, and you can see it as an inspiring film."&lt;ref name=jay /&gt;

{{quote box|width=35%|align=left|quote="Like many moviemakers [...], Mr. Scott loves his bad guy too much. And by turning Lucas into a figure who seduces instead of repels, an object of directorial fetishism and a token of black resistance, however hollow, he encourages us to submit as well. Part of this is structural and economic: blood and nihilism are always better sells than misery and hopelessness. Yet there's also a historical dimension, because when Lucas strolls down a fast-emptying Harlem street after putting a bullet into another man’s head and the camera pulls back for the long view, you are transported into the realm of myth. Once, another gunman, or the director, might have taken direct aim at Lucas. But the world belongs to gangsters now, not cowboys."|source=—Manohla Dargis of ''The New York Times''&lt;ref name=nyttimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/movies/02gang.html|last=Dargis|first=Manolha|title=American Gangster (2007)|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a perfect four star rating and opined, "This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well." Ebert also praised Crowe's performance, saying that his contribution to the storytelling was "enormous".&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071101/REVIEWS/711010303|title=American Gangster |accessdate=November 5, 2011 |date=November 2, 2007 |last=Ebert |first=Robert |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Paul Byrnes of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' felt that ''American Gangster'' was "one of the most intelligent gangster films in years" and expressed that the film offers "the spectacle of grand themes and two bigger-than-life characters played by two of the best actors in cinema." Concluding his review, Byrnes gave the film four out of four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film-reviews/american-gangster/2008/01/03/1198949939913.html|title=American Gangster|first=Paul|last=Byrnes|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=January 3, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Jim "Stax" Vejvoda rated the film four out of five stars, praising the acting—particularly of the two protagonists, "both dynamic presences on-screen, with neither actor outweighing the other's importance to the story"—and declaring that despite being preceded by other gangster stories such as ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''American Gangster'' managed to justify its existence with "emphasis on the human and class elements of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/01/american-gangster-review-2|title=American Gangster Blu-ray Review|last=Monfette, Pirrello|first=Christopher, Phil|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111092627/http://movies.ign.com/articles/831/831913p1.html|archivedate=November 11, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manohla Dargis of ''The New York Times'' strongly commended the film, opining that "greatness hovers just outside ''American Gangster''." She continued: "It's a seductive package, crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city back in the day, when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red."&lt;ref name=nyttimes/&gt; These sentiments were echoed by Sukhdev Sandhu of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', who asserted that the storyline was "amazing".&lt;ref name="Tele"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/3669300/Film-reviews-American-Gangster-and-Brick-Lane.html|title=Film reviews: American Gangster and Brick Lane|first=Sukhdev |last=Sandhu |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, some reviewers were more critical of ''American Gangster''. Jonathan Crocker of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'' was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'' and ''[[Prince of the City]]'' – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84261/american-gangster.html|title=American Gangster (2007)|last=Crocker|first=Jonathan|website=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]|date=November 18, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that ''American Gangster'' is "never dull, but it could have used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue." Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have "a ghastly ingenuity".&lt;ref name=ewew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20155724,00.html|title=American Gangster (2007)|first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was "undeniably enjoyable" and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks" and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134550|title=American Gangster|website=Empire|first=Ian|last=Freer |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slant Magazine]] journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was "dumb as a rock", and that it was "far too convinced of its import to be any fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/american-gangster/3211|title=American Gangster|first=Nick|last=Schager|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|publisher=|date=October 21, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving ''American Gangster'' a two out of five stars, [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." He resumed: "He never has the menace of his dirty cop in ''[[Training Day]]'', and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]''. That shoulder-shimmying swagger is rarely seen, and the brand-classic robes of ''American Gangster'' sit on him heavily."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/16/russellcrowe.denzelwashington|title=American Gangster |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accuracy of the film====
In an interview with [[MSNBC]], Lucas expressed his excitement about the film and amazement at Denzel Washington's portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://insidedateline.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/10/26/4374157-breakfast-with-the-real-american-gangster |title=Breakfast with the real 'American Gangster'|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date= October 26, 2007 |author=Davis, Bradley |work=[[Dateline NBC|Inside Dateline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lucas admitted to several news outlets that only a small portion of the film was true,&lt;ref name=GangLiesNYPost&gt;{{Cite web|title=GANGING UP ON MOVIE'S 'LIES' |website=New York Post |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/item_KbkhlJoI4y3vbAa9lEAEZN;jsessionid=3AB880C9B783B42F3625F06ACCFC358D |author=[[Susannah Cahalan]] |date=November 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214041142/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/item_KbkhlJoI4y3vbAa9lEAEZN |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that much of it was fabricated for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=TheVoice&gt;{{cite web|date = 2007-12-09|url = http://archive.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=12509|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120917180100/http://archive.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=12509|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2012-09-17|title = The Real American Gangster|publisher = voice-online|accessdate = 2008-03-08|last = Janelle Oswald|quote = She spent five years in prison for aiding her husband's narcotic smuggling trade.

Roberts criticized the portrayal of Lucas, describing it as "almost noble".&lt;ref name=GangLiesNYPost/&gt;

[[Sterling Johnson Jr.]], a federal judge who served as a special narcotics prosecutor for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] and assisted the arrest and trial of Lucas, described the film as "one percent reality and ninety-nine percent Hollywood." In addition, Johnson described the real life Lucas as "illiterate, vicious, violent, and everything Denzel Washington was not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Coyle, Jake|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/295102|title=Fabrications dim American Gangster's Oscar hopes|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Jack Toal, Gregory Korniloff, and Louis Diaz filed a lawsuit against Universal saying that the events in the film were fictionalized and that the film [[Defamation|defamed]] them and hundreds of other agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&amp;nav=F8nI|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208093858/http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&amp;nav=F8nI|archivedate=February 8, 2008|title=DEA agents sue over 'American Gangster' |publisher=[[WPRI-TV|WPRI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by US District Judge Colleen McMahon. While McMahon noted that the [[intertitle]] that appears at the end of the film, stating that Lucas' collaboration led to the arrest of many corrupt DEA agents, was "wholly inaccurate", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished that "It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to "show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent".&lt;ref name="ABC/Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher =[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]/[[Reuters]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/american-gangster-lawsuit-dismissed/1045622|title=American Gangster lawsuit dismissed|date= February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as being the right-hand man of [[Bumpy Johnson]], rising above the power of the Mafia and [[Leroy Barnes|Nicky Barnes]], and that he was the mastermind behind the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a biographer of Frank Lucas, deemed the story as a myth. [[Associated Press]] entertainment writer Frank Coyle noted that "this mess happened partly because journalists have been relying on secondary sources removed from the actual events."&lt;ref&gt;Chepesiuk, Ron (January 17, 2008).

'''''An Uncommon Story''''' ({{lang-ru|Необыкнове́нная исто́рия|translit=Neobyknovennaya istoriya}}) is an [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] literary [[memoir]] by [[Ivan Goncharov]], written in 1875&amp;ndash;1876 (with an 1878 addendum) and first published in [[1924 in literature|1924]]. Parts of it were later included into ''The Complete Goncharov'' (1978&amp;ndash;1980, Vol VII).

According to the [[Gale (publisher)|''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'']], ''An Uncommon Story'' "…confirmed the psychopathic side of [its author's] personality; it is an account of imagined plots against him and imagined attempts by others to plagiarize his work."&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date=| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ivan-goncharov| title =Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov| publisher  = Gale Encyclopedia of Biography| accessdate = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers disagreed, finding there was much more veracity to Goncharov's claims than had previously been reported.&lt;ref name="feb"&gt;{{cite web | author = Budanova, N.F.| date = | url = http://feb-web.ru/feb/gonchar/critics/gmi/gmi-1842.htm| script-title=The Uncommon Story: The True Facts. Foreword. | publisher  = feb-web.ru|language=Russian| accessdate = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Uncommon Story'' had one single agenda: to prove that [[Ivan Turgenev]] has not only borrowed  major ideas, character types, and conflicts from Goncharov's ''[[The Precipice (Ivan Goncharov)|The Precipice]]'' to use in his ''[[Home of the Gentry]]'', but also (in the author's words) "infused the best European literature with them." 

''An Uncommon Story'' caused much debate; that it was published at all caused some controversy, for according to its author's special request, these memoirs were to be issued only in case plagiarism accusations were brought against him after his death. Since no such allegations have ever been made, Goncharov's book was formally published contrary to his will. In this same note, however, the author mentioned that he wished for future "historians of Russian literature" to take hold of it. 

It was the latter who deemed the publication advisable since (according to scholar N. F. Budanova) "it shed an important light upon Goncharov and Turgenev's relations," and also provided researchers with "valuable material for making a comparative analysis of both classic novels which, indeed, had striking similarities."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Ivan Goncharov.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Goncharov]]
In the mid-1850s, Ivan Goncharov and Ivan Turgenev were on friendly terms. Goncharov, who'd launched his career in a spectacular fashion and was declared by some a "true [[Nikolay Gogol]] heir", had no serious rival as a novelist on the Russian literary scene until the late 1850s; [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] was still in exile, [[Leo Tolstoy]] was writing novelets and short stories, and Turgenev was considered a master of miniatures. 

The success of ''[[Home of the Gentry]]'' must have come as a surprise to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: "Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but you seem to be eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: ''Если смею выразить Вам взгляд мой на Ваш талант, то скажу, что Вам дан нежный, верный рисунок и звуки, а Вы порываетесь строить огромные здания... и хотите дать драму.&lt;/ref&gt; Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Literary historians argued later that Turgenev's overnight success might have seemed totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, felt like he was the only master of his field. Goncharov produced one  novel in a decade, but his new rival did it in a seemingly fleeting manner, which must have made the injustice look even more gross. 

Of all the possible explanations for the improbable manner in which Turgenev, a master of miniatures, could have suddenly re-invented himself as a novelist, only one for Goncharov looked plausible: the younger man must have nicked his own ideas, structures, conflicts, and character types, and "with these pearls started to play his own lyre." 

Some commentators later dismissed such claims as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general [[hypochondria]]. Others argued that this would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were not altogether groundless. At least one fact was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;
[[File:Iwan Turgenew.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Turgenev]]]]

In 1887, four years after Turgenev's death, Goncharov attached a note to this novel's original text, which read: "This manuscript contains the material for a novel which in 1869, as ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' was about to publish it, I gave the title ''The Precipice''. Before that I used to refer to is as ''Raisky, the Artist'' and was freely expounding upon it to my fellow writers, mostly to Turgenev. It was to him that in 1855, soon after returning from my around-the-world journey, I recounted in detail, in the course of several meetings, all the details of it [...] because he, being a perceptive and sensitive  man of art, seemed to be most sympathetic to those of my works that he promised a great future for."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two men were very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an impeccable literary taste. In ''An Uncommon Story'' he wrote: "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, ''[[Oblomov]]'' will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes."&lt;ref&gt;An Uncommon Story. P.202.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tellingly, Turgenev even prompted minor detail to ''Oblomov'', namely, in the scene where Olga and Schtoltz converse in [[Switzerland]]. Goncharov acknowledged Turgenev's priority in "discovering nihilism", and admitted there was historical and artistic authenticity to Bazarov's character. In the late 1850s relations between the two apparently deteriorated, and in March 1860 things came to a head.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

===Accusations of plagiarism===
Prior to the publication of ''Home of the Gentry'', Goncharov took an opportunity to get acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from ''The Precipice'', the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: "Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar [to that of mine]; you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied." In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in ''The Precipice''), which, being "a weak one", had been "magnanimously sacrificed" by Turgenev.&lt;ref&gt;''Complete Goncharov'', Moscow, 1978, Vol.VIII, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of ''Home of the Gentry'', but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this  corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

On March 29, 1860, in the critic [[Stepan Dudyshkin]]'s flat an "arbitrary court" took place, with [[Pavel Annenkov]], [[Alexander Druzhinin]] and [[Aleksandr Nikitenko]] present. The court's verdict was conciliatory: "Since both Turgenev's and Goncharov's novels have had for their ground the very same soil of Russian reality, similarities and coincidences, in ideas and even phraseology, would only be natural and for both writers excusable."&lt;ref&gt;Annenkov, Pavel. Literature Memoirs. М., 1960. Pp.441—442. //Nikitenko, Vol.2, pp.115—116.&lt;/ref&gt; After that Goncharov and Turgenev stopped communicating. In 1864, at Druzhinin's funeral, they made peace but never became friends again, even if Turgenev in one of his letters mentioned his feeling "very close to Goncharov." As Turgenev's new novels were appearing one after another, Goncharov was becoming more and more resentful, apparently seeing his worst suspicions confirmed.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

====The manuscript====
The original manuscript, a notebook, consisting of 53 pages, held in the Russian National Library, according to N.Budanova, looks very much like a rough copy that's never been revisited by the author, with lots of edits, some fragments blotted out so as to be unreconstructable. The notebook consists of two parts, written in different times. Part 1, ''Uncommon Story (True Facts)'', pages 1–50, is dated December 1875 and January 1876. The author's commentary to it reads: {{quote|Hereby I express my will for my ancestors or whoever get hold of this manuscript, to extract from it and make public whatever they feel necessary [...] but only if, through Turgenev’s efforts, or otherwise, a notion (based on similarities between my novel and those of Turgenev and some West European authors) should become prevalent in the press that it was me who had borrowed from them and not vice versa, and that I was just following other people's steps. [Otherwise]... I would like this manuscript to be burnt down or transferred to the Imperial Public library for the use of future historians of Russian literature.}} 
Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, had another note attached to it: "I've sealed the previous fifty pages in an envelope as finished. But in the course of the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue..." There is an inscription on the envelope: "These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883".&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
''An Uncommon Story'' was first published in 1924 by the Russian Public Library archives, with a foreword by D. I. Abramovich. It was preceded by the publication in 1923 of the whole of the Goncharov-Turgenev correspondence by Boris Engelgardt, who accompanied it with a thorough analysis of the two authors' relations.&lt;ref&gt;I.A.Goncharov and I.S.Turgenev. From the Unpublished material of the Pushkin House. Foreword and commentaries by B.M. Engelgardt, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the issue lay dormant. 
[[File:Uncommon story autograph.jpg|thumb|Page 1 of ''An Uncommon Story'' manuscript. 1875 authoghraph.]]
Then in 1972, A. Batyuto suggested Goncharov might have been a major influence on early Turgenev, after all.&lt;ref&gt;Batyuto, A. Turgenev and Goncharov // Turgenev the Novelist. Leningrad, 1972. Pp.326—349.&lt;/ref&gt; Having drawn the comparative analysis of Turgenev's ''[[On the Eve]]'' and Goncharov's ''The Precipice'', the author came to the conclusion: the former most obviously used "methods of novel-structuring he'd borrowed from other writers, Goncharov included". According to Batyuto, when it came to the art of building up a novel, Turgenev in his early days was certainly taking cues from Goncharov.&lt;ref&gt;Batyuto, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, O. Demikhovskaya in an article called "I.A. Goncharov and I.S. Turgenev" criticized the 'biased approach' to the problem demonstrated by Engelgardt, who in 1923 made an emphasis on Goncharov's personal idiosyncrasies as being the major factor behind the conflict. She presented Turgenev as the guilty party and recounted numerous quarrels he had with [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Materials, 1976. Pp.85—94.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to V. Nezdvedtsky, the reason behind the two writers' conflict was "the typological resemblances of both and Goncharov's jealousy of his more fortunate rival." The author poined out that, while working on a completely new type of Russian novel (and leaving behind Grigorovich and Pisemsky with their traditionalism), both Goncharov (who first came up with the idea of plotline's "poetisation") and Turgenev were up against common challenges and were therefore keenly aware of each other's works. This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in ''An Uncommon Story'' drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences.&lt;ref&gt;Nezdvedtsky, V.A. The Uncommon Story, VII, pp.449—458 // The Turgenev vs Goncharov conflict as an issue for literary historians. // Slavica. Debrecen. 1986. Vol.XXIII. Pp.315—332.&lt;/ref&gt; N. Budanova thought such thing would have been impossible at the time for it would have been perceived by the public as a confession of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt; 

While the fact that ''The Precipice'' and ''Home of the Gentry'' had a lot in common, Goncharov's other allegations have been unanimously dismissed by literary historians as groundless. Parallels he's drawn between ''The Precipice'' and Turgenev's ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' were proved to be far-fetched, as was his claim that ''[[Torrents of Spring]]'', was 'an improvisation' on ''The Precipice''{{'}} part I.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt; Goncharov's claims that some European authors started to use his ideas and character types through Turgenev's influence are seen to be void, although Budanova noted that  some contemporary critics might have prompted such an idea to the author who in his later life grew to be highly impressionable and suspicious. For example, [[Aleksey Suvorin]] in his article "The French Society in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s new novel" suggested that the ''[[Sentimental Education]]''{{'}} main character Frédéric Moreau was "akin to the so-called 'people of the 1840s' in Russia and that he was "similar to Raisky... its just that Flaubert has treated his character more objectively than our respected novelist."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vestnik Evropy]]''. 1870, No.2. P.822.&lt;/ref&gt; Some similarities between Goncharov's characters and those of [[Madame Bovary]] have been mentioned by Russian critics too.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Goncharov's allegations, made in ''An Uncommon Story'', that Turgenev did a lot of harm to Russian literature in the West, have been proved invalid. On the contrary, Turgenev has been praised by many as an avid a promoter of Russian classics: his own translations of the works by [[Pushkin]], [[Lermontov]] and [[Gogol]] into French did a lot to popularize them in Europe. Several translations of important Russian works have been made through his recommendations. "We have every reason to insist that Turgenev preached Russian literature to the West. Forms and methods of such popularization have been different, and it is upon Turgenev's great authority that Western views on many Russian novels are still being based upon," wrote Soviet scholar Mikhail Alekseev in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Alexeyev, M.P. I.S.Turgenev as the Russian Literature's propagator in the West. The works of the New Russian literature dpt. Moscow, Leningrad, 1948. P.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apapa Hoard''' is an important collection of medieval bronze jewellery found at [[Apapa]] near [[Lagos]], Nigeria. Dating to the early 16th Century, the hoard has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=16157&amp;plaA=16157-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
Items from the treasure consist entirely of bronze [[jewellery]]. They include a pair of wire bracelets, two bracelets designed in the form of interlocking animals, two [[Staff of office|staff]]-mounts with [[pendant]] bells, two ring-shaped armlets, a group of bells, a ring with cascabels and a [[gorget|breast plate]] in the shape of a ram's head with pendant bells. The latter object is the most prestigious item from the hoard and is one of the finest cast bronzes ever found in southern [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=619723&amp;partId=1&amp;place=16157&amp;plaA=16157-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard was discovered by accident in 1907 when a [[Water well|well]] was being dug to a depth of 3 metres. The jewellery would have been worn by an elite member of a local tribe living in 15th-16th centuries and has been attributed by scholars to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Kingdom of [[Owo]], which was for a long time under the control of the [[Benin Empire]]. Soon after its discovery, the hoard was acquired by a private collector who later sold it to the British Museum in 1930.

'''Arte Povera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈarte ˈpɔːvera|pron}}; literally ''poor art'') is a [[contemporary art]] movement. The Arte Povera movement took place between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s in major cities throughout Italy and above all in [[Turin]]. Other cities where the movement was also important are [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Naples]] and [[Bologna]]. The term was coined by Italian art critic [[Germano Celant]] in 1967&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=J.U-S.|title=Arte Povera’s radical simplicity|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/10/post-war-art|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in [[Italy]] during the period of upheaval at the end of the 1960s, when artists were taking a [[Political radicalism|radical]] stance.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Arte Povera|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10454|work=MoMA: The Collection|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began attacking the values of established institutions of government, industry, and culture.

The exhibition "Im Spazio" (The Space of Thoughts), curated by Celant and held at the Galleria La Bertesca in Genoa, Italy, from September through October 1967, is often considered to be the official starting point of Arte Povera.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Celant, who became one of Arte Povera's major proponents, organized two exhibitions in 1967 and 1968, followed by an influential book published by Electa in 1985 called ''Arte Povera Storie e protagonisti/Arte Povera. Histories and Protagonists'', promoting the notion of a revolutionary art, free of convention, the power of structure, and the market place.

Although Celant attempted to encompass the radical elements of the entire international scene, the term properly centered on a group of Italian artists who attacked the corporate mentality with an art of unconventional materials and style. Key figures closely associated with the movement are [[Giovanni Anselmo]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Enrico Castellani]], [[Pier Paolo Calzolari]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Marisa Merz]], [[Giulio Paolini]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Giuseppe Penone]],  [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Emilio Prini]], and [[Gilberto Zorio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyn|title=Arte Povera|year=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4556-6|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often used [[found object]]s in their works. Other early exponents of radical change in the visual arts include proto Arte Povera artists: [[Antoni Tàpies]] and the [[Dau al Set]] movement, [[Alberto Burri]], [[Piero Manzoni]], and [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Spatialism]]. Art dealer [[Ileana Sonnabend]] was a champion of the movement.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

==Trends and concepts==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
* A return to simple objects and messages
* The body and behavior are art
* The everyday becomes meaningful
* Traces of nature and industry appear
* Dynamism and energy are embodied in the work
* Nature can be documented in its physical and chemical transformation
* Explore the notion of space and language
* Complex and symbolic signs lose meaning
* Ground Zero, no culture, no art system, Art = Life

==Artists==
[[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later 1960s he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of "art" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of ''Arte Povera''. In his 1967 ''Muretto di straci'' (''Rag Wall'') Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric.

[[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Mario Merz]] attempted to make the experience of art more immediately real while also more closely connecting the individual to nature. In his ''(Untitled /Twelve Horses)'', Kounellis brings the real, natural life into the gallery setting, by showing twelve horses racked-up on the gallery walls. Recalling the [[Dada]] movement and [[Marcel Duchamp]], his aim was to challenge what could be defined as art, but unlike Duchamp, maintains the objects real and alive, redefining the notion of life and art, while keeping both entities independent.{{Quote | text=The 'reality effect' is not secondary but constitutive.(...)Kounellis shifts the frontier of what can be defined as art, but there is never the idea that art should be dissolved into life. On the contrary, art is given a new message as a rite of initiation through which to re-experience life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumley|first=Robert|title=Movements in Modern Art, Povera Arte|year=2004|publisher=Tate|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Piero Gilardi]], much like the aim of Arte Povera itself, was concerned with bridging the natural and the artificial. In his ''(Nature Carpets)'', 1965, which gained him recognition and assimilation into the Arte Povera movement, Gilardi built three-dimensional carpets out of [[polyurethane]] which used "natural" leaves, rocks, and soil as decoration, design and art meshed together to question societal sensibilities towards what is real and natural and how artificiality was being engrained into the contemporary commercialized world.

[[File:Taykinposter.JPG|right|thumb|Poster for ''The Great Tay-Kin'' by Law and [[George Grossmith|Grossmith]]]]
'''William Arthur Law''' (22 March 1844 – 2 April 1913), better known as '''Arthur Law''', was an [[English people|English]] playwright, actor and scenic designer.

==Life and career==
Law was born in [[Northrepps]], [[Norfolk]], England,&lt;ref name=VoE&gt;{{cite book | title = Visitation of England and Wales | volume =  7 |editor-last=Howard |editor-first=Joseph Jackson |editor-first2=Frederick Arthur |editor-last2=Crisp | year = 1899 | page = 64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=btYKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to Rev. Patrick Comerford Law and his wife, Frances ''nee'' Arbuthnot.  He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.  From 1864 to 1872, he served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]].&lt;ref name=MaW&gt;{{cite book | title = Men and women of the time: a dictionary of contemporaries | last = Plarr | first = Victor | edition = 15th | publisher = G. Routledge | year = 1899 | page = 625 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CPcMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Law began to act, making his professional stage debut in 1872 at the Theatre Royal, [[Edinburgh]].  He then toured the British provinces and played at London's [[Surrey Theatre]] for two years, after which joined the [[German Reed Entertainments]] in London in 1874.&lt;ref name=MaW/&gt;  While performing with the [[Thomas German Reed|German Reeds]], he wrote nineteen short comic theatre works performed by the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1026 Law, Arthur William], ''Who's Who'', 1907, vol. 59, p. 1026&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1877, Law married actress [[Fanny Holland]], with whom he appeared with the German Reeds at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] and [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]].  The couple had a son named Hamilton Patrick John Holland Law (born 1879).&lt;ref name=VoE/&gt;

Some of Law's plays for the German Reeds include ''A Night Surprise'' in 1877 (under the pseudonym, "West Cromer"), ''A Happy Bungalow'' (1877), with music by [[Charles King Hall]]; ''Cherry Tree Farm'' (1881)&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 June 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nobody’s Fault'' (1882), both with music by [[Hamilton Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText2003/20030426.html Review of ''Nobody’s Fault''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310193857/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText2003/20030426.html |date=10 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, he wrote ''[[Uncle Samuel]]'', a curtain raiser for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] played at the [[Opera Comique]], with music by [[George Grossmith]].  It played, together with ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', in 1881, and Law appeared in the role of John Bird.  Law later appeared on stage at the [[Savoy Theatre]] as Mr. Wranglebury in the companion piece ''[[Mock Turtles (opera)|Mock Turtles]]'' in 1882, and as Major Murgatroyd in ''Patience'' in 1882, filling in for [[Frank Thornton]].&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/L/LawArthur.htm Arthur Law], Who Was Who in the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 15 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During a two-year period, from 1879 to 1881, Law and Holland performed on tour as "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Arthur Law's Entertainment," but the venture proved unsuccessful.  He retired from acting following a final engagement at [[Savoy Theatre]], in 1881, to turn his attention completely to writing.&lt;ref name=MaW/&gt;

===Later years===
His first "serious" drama, ''Hope'', was produced at London's Standard Theatre in 1882.  That year he also wrote a musical farce, ''Mr. Guffin's Elopement'', in collaboration with George Grossmith, for [[Toole's Theatre]], starring [[J. L. Toole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London| publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, Grossmith and Law wrote ''The Great Tay-Kin'', produced at Toole's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/people/gg.html Review that mentions ''The Great Tay-Kin'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Law wrote dozens of other plays.  His best known include an adaptation of ''[[The Mystery of a Hansom Cab]]'', produced at the [[Princess's Theatre]] in 1888; ''The Judge'', produced at [[Terry's Theatre]] in 1890; ''The Magic Opal'' (an [[operetta]] with music by [[Isaac Albéniz]]) played at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in 1893; ''The New Boy'' at Terry's and the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in 1894; ''The Sea Flower'' at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in 1898, ''A Country Mouse'' at the Prince of Wales's in 1902; ''The Bride and Bridegroom'' at the New Theatre in 1904; and ''Artful Miss Dearing'' at Terry's in 1909.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

A few of Law’s plays were also produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], including ''The New Boy'' in 1894 at the [[Manhattan Theatre|Standard Theatre]] and ''A Country Mouse'' in 1902 at the Savoy Theatre. He also created the scenic design for ''The Bachelor'', by [[Clyde Fitch]], in 1909 at the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=4309 "Arthur Law"], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Law died in [[Parkstone]], a suburb of [[Poole]], [[Dorset]], England at the age of 69.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

The '''Artistic Patronage of the Neapolitan Angevin dynasty''' includes the creation of sculpture, architecture and paintings during the reigns of Charles I, Charles II and Robert of Anjou in the south of Italy.

In 1266, [[Charles of Anjou]] established the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] dynasty, a royal dynasty that ruled [[Naples]] until 1435. Upon taking the crown, Charles of Anjou (now Charles I) hoped to solidify his rule by commissioning great works of art for public display.  Recognizing art's potential as a political tool, Charles invited artists from [[France]] and [[Italy]] to join him at his court in Naples. Subsequent [[kings of Naples]] would also employ art as a means of validating their dynastic claims. This forged a tradition of artistic [[patronage]] in which the Royal Court of Naples functioned as an important artistic center, drawing artists and architects from throughout France and Italy. From their impressive artistic and architectural programs, emerged a Neapolitan variation of the [[French Gothic]] style that became increasingly dominated by Italian artistic developments.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Paoletti and Gary M. Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 3rd ed. (London: Laurence King Publishing, 2005), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Arnolfo di Cambio]], [[Pietro Cavallini]], and [[Simone Martini]] created works for the Angevin kings of Naples, contributing to the kingdom's wealth of artistic riches.

==Charles I of Anjou==

===Sculpture===
Tuscan sculptor [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] entered the service of Charles I in 1277. Prior to arriving in Rome, Arnolfo di Cambio had worked on the [[pulpit]] for the [[Siena Cathedral]] as part of the workshop of [[Nicola Pisano]], which was completed in 1268.  Arnolfo di Cambio completed a marble statue of the Charles I now housed in the [[Musei Capitolini]]. One of the first portrait statues since [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], the statue of Charles I helped set the precedent for royal portrait sculpture in the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Jill Elizabeth Blondin, “Pope Sixtus IV at Assisi: The Promotion of Papal Power,” in Patronage and Dynasty: The Rise of the Della Rovere in Renaissance Italy, ed. Ian Verstegen (Kirksville, MO: Truman State University Press, 2007), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact location of its original placement is not known, it would be fair to assume that it stood in a monumental setting where it could be admired by the King's subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williamson, Gothic Sculpture, 1140-1300 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998), 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture shows the king sitting stoically with a royal scepter in his right hand and a jeweled crown upon his head.  In addition to this medieval iconography, however, King Charles's royal robes and lion headed [[curule seat]] have been borrowed from [[Roman sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lincoln Frothingham, The monuments of Christian Rome from Constantine to the Renaissance (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1908), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnolfo di Cambio portrayed this medieval Neapolitan King as an authoritative [[Roman Emperor]], but has also succeeded in maintaining the individual likeness of his royal patron.

===Architecture===
As the founder of a new royal dynasty, Charles I needed to build a royal residence that could function as the seat of his government. He commissioned architect [[Pietro de Caulis]] to design the [[Castel Nuovo]] (1279–87), which was to serve as the residence of the kings and queens of Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Janis Elliott and Cordelia Warr, “Introduction,” in The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina: Art, Iconography, and Patronage in Fourteenth Century Naples, ed. Janis Elliott and Cordelia Warr (Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2004), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles I provided funding for the rebuilding of the [[Franciscan]] church of [[San Lorenzo Maggiore (Naples)|San Lorenzo Maggiore]], an early example of the Neapolitan adaptation of the French Gothic style.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott and Warr, “Introduction,” in Elliott and Warr, The Church of [[Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia|Santa Maria Donna Regina]], 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[tracery]] designs at San Lorenzo Maggiore were inspired by the French Gothic church of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint Denis]], its “cavernous [[nave]] and its unarticulated walls” show the influence of Italian Franciscan churches.&lt;ref name="Paolettiand"&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles II of Anjou==

===Architecture===
During the reign of [[Charles II of Anjou]] (1285-1308), the second Angevin King of Naples, the king's wife, [[Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples]], was responsible for initiating a number of architectural projects. The most important of these projects was the rebuilding of the Clarissan convent of [[Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia]], after an earthquake destroyed the original convent in 1293. In 1307, Queen Mary donated funds to the abbess of the Clarissans for the construction of the new church. The Clarissans, or [[Poor Clares]], were the female branch of the Franciscan Order, founded by [[Saint Clare of Assisi]]. The church comprises two levels; on the ground level is a dark, low-vaulted nave and above it is a [[choir]] supported on eight columns.&lt;ref&gt;Cathleen A. Fleck, “’Blessed the Eyes that See Those Things you See’: The Trecento Choir Frescoes at Santa Maria Donnaregina in Naples,” Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 67, no. 2 (2004): 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground level was most likely for the congregation and the upper level reserved for the nuns.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fleck, “ 'Blessed the Eyes that See Those Things you See,’” 204&lt;/ref&gt; A polygonal [[apse]] with [[stained glass]] [[lancet windows]] illuminates the church, contrasting with the dark nave below.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By commissioning Santa Maria Donna Regina, Mary of Hungary began a tradition of royal female patronage in the Kingdom of Naples.&lt;ref name="Paolettiand" /&gt;

[[File:Sandommaghigh3.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The Church of [[San Domenico Maggiore, Naples|San Domenico Maggiore]] in Naples (apse area).]]
In 1283, Charles II funded the reconstruction of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church of [[San Domenico Maggiore]], a church similar to his father's church of San Lorenzo Maggiore in its fusion of French Gothic and Italian stylistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott and Warr, “Introduction,” in Elliott and Warr, The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
In 1308, Roman painter [[Pietro Cavallini]] and a group of his pupils arrived at the royal court Naples. Cavallini and his students are believed to have been commissioned by Mary of Hungary to paint the [[fresco]] cycles located above the choir in the church of [[Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia|Santa Maria Donna Regina]].&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Kelly, “Religious patronage and royal propaganda in Angevin Naples: Santa Maria Donna Regina in context,” in Elliott and Warr, The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The fresco cycles, completed between 1320 and 1323, cover all four of the church walls and include: the [[Last judgment]] on the west wall; pairs of prophets and apostles and the lives of [[Saint Agnes]] and [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] on the south wall; pairs of prophets and apostles, the life of [[Saint Elizabeth of Hungary]], and the [[Passion of Christ]] on the north wall; an “angelic hierarchy” on the east wall.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, “’Blessed the Eyes that See Those Things you See,’” 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1308, Charles II commissioned Pietro Cavallini to paint a fresco cycle depicting three scenes from the life of [[Mary Magdalene]] in the Brancaccio chapel at the Dominican church of San Domenico Maggiore. The painter [[Giotto]] worked at the royal court of Naples from 1328 until 1332, during which time he painted a number of panel paintings and frescoes. All of these works are unfortunately lost, but a work by one of his followers survives in the Brancaccio Chapel at the church of San Domenico Maggiore, a fresco of [[Noli Me Tangere]] from around 1310.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 129-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robert of Anjou==

===Painting===
[[Robert of Anjou]] was the third son of King Charles II and Mary of Hungary. Charles II's first son [[Charles Martel of Anjou]] had died by 1295, putting his second son Louis next in line for the throne.  Louis, however, did not desire the crown of Naples, and would instead become [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] of [[Toulouse]] in 1296. Louis and Charles II died in 1297 and in 1308 respectively, leading to Robert's coronation in 1309. By 1317, Louis, with the help of Robert's royal influence, was canonized as [[Saint Louis of Toulouse]].  The Neapolitan House of Anjou now possessed its own saint, which Robert of Anjou would use to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse, Robert of Anjou and Simone Martini,” Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 39, no. 1 (1976): 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this year that the [[Sienese]] painter Simone Martini was commissioned, most likely by Robert of Anjou, to paint the Altarpiece of St Louis of Toulouse, now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[altarpiece]], Saint Louis of Toulouse sits enthroned in his brown sackcloth and crimson jeweled [[cope]], holding his [[crozier]] with his right hand and donning his bishop's [[mitre]] on his haloed head.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Hyman, Sienese Painting (London: Thames and Hudson, 2003), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Two angels hover over him, sustaining the crown of sainthood above his mitre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 22.&lt;/ref&gt; As he receives the celestial crown, the Saint, with his left hand, offers the Neapolitan crown to his brother Robert of Anjou, shown in profile, who kneels before him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

[[File:Simone Martini. St. Louis of Toulouse Altarpiece. 1317. Mus.Capodimonte, Naples..jpg|thumb|250px|Altarpiece of Saint Louis of Toulouse by Simone Martini, 1317.]]
Despite the presence of [[religious iconography]], the altarpiece's motives were more political than devotional.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert of Anjou's nephew [[Caroberto]], as the son of Charles II's first son Charles Martel, had a legitimate claim to the Neapolitan throne. Robert of Anjou sought to validate his royal ascension through Simone Martini's employment of both dynastic and religious iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Suzette Denise Scotti, “Simone Martini’s St. Louis of Toulouse and its Cultural Context” (master’s thesis, Louisiana State University, 2009), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Iconographic parallels can be identified between Simone Martini's figure of Saint Louis of Toulouse and Arnolfo di Cambio's figure of Charles of Anjou.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both figures are shown frontally and are seated on lion-shaped thrones; they wield objects of power and wear jeweled crowns.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Louis is represented more like a great king than a Franciscan saint, emphasizing the altarpiece's political function.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the altarpiece's dynastic political power was derived from its decorative iconography. The most prominent dynastic icon featured in the altarpiece is the [[fleur-de-lys]], the symbol of the [[French monarchy]]. The Angevins of Naples had descended from the French [[House of Capet]] and thus utilized the fleur-de-lys as their royal emblem. The fleur-de-lys motif is punched into the traditional Sienese gold ground, forming a decorative border around Simone Martini's main panel.&lt;ref name="Hyman, Sienese Art, 50"&gt;Hyman, Sienese Art, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The frame of the altarpiece is painted a deep blue and decorated with large gold fleurs-de-lys, modelled in deep [[relief]].&lt;ref name="Hyman, Sienese Art, 50"/&gt; Below the frame is a [[predella]] in which Simone Martini painted five scenes from the life of Saint Louis of Toulouse. This would have proved challenging for Simone as Saint Louis had just been canonized, requiring him to invent a new set of iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 30.&lt;/ref&gt; These scenes function as both religious and dynastic icons by depicting the miracles of a saint from the Angevin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Two additional dynastic icons can be observed on the clasp of St Louis's cope: the red and yellow heraldic colors of Provence and the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Paolettiand_a"&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 132&lt;/ref&gt; By presenting these two territories, both claimed by the Angevins, Simone has revealed the extent of Robert of Anjou's political reach.&lt;ref name="Paolettiand_a"/&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Monastero di SantaChiaraNaples.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Façade (right) and belltower of Santa Chiara.]]
Robert of Anjou and his wife [[Sancha of Majorca]] financed the construction of the Franciscan double convent of [[Santa Chiara (Naples)]]. The monastic complex was begun in around 1310 by the architect Gagliardo Primario and was completed by the 1340s. The structure included two [[cloisters]] to separately house the Poor Clares and the Franciscan friars.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Astrid Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples: Church building in Angevin Italy, 1266-1343 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2004), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The main church comprised a long nave with nine lateral chapels on each side and a friars’ choir at the far end by the main [[altar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; A wall stood behind the friars’ choir, separating it from the nuns’ choir located on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[long gallery]], supported by the lateral chapels, stretched across the length of the church, above which was a row of [[clerestory]] windows.&lt;ref&gt;Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of Santa Chiara alludes to the cathedrals of [[Provence]] and [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Chiara's monumental scale surpassed that of all churches in the kingdom, turning this Franciscan convent into a display of Angevin royal power.&lt;ref&gt;Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 133-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[File:Maria di Ungheria Tino.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Funerary monument of Mary of Hungary in Santa Maria Donna Regina by Tino di Camaino.]]
In order to further solidify his dynastic claims, Robert of Anjou initiated an ambitious campaign to erect funerary monuments for members of the Angevin dynasty. The tomb's structure inside of Santa Chiara was designed by architect Gagliardo Primario and the individual funerary monuments were erected by a number of different sculptors. Robert commissioned the Sienese sculptor [[Tino di Camaino]] to create the funerary monument for his mother, Mary of Hungary. Tino di Camaino had arrived at the royal court of Naples in 1323 and worked for the Angevins for the last fourteen years of his life. Unlike the other funerary monuments commissioned by Robert, which were to be erected inside of the monastic complex of Santa Chiara, Mary of Hungary was to be placed inside of Santa Maria Donna Regina. Tino's sculptural monument for Mary consisted of a [[sarcophagus]] decorated with seven niches, each one containing a sculpted figure of one of her seven sons.&lt;ref name="Paolettiand_a" /&gt; Featured most prominently in the central [[niche (architecture)|niche]] is St. Louis of Toulouse.&lt;ref name="Paolettiand_a" /&gt; Robert sits to his right, affirming the king's celestial ties. In this representation of Robert, as in Simone Martini's painting, his dynastic legitimacy is emphasized. He sits majestically, wearing a crown and holding symbols of royal power. The chest of Mary's tomb is adorned with figures depicting the [[four cardinal virtues]]: Prudentia, Temperantia. Justitia, and Fortitudo.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Schaus, ed., Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia (New York: Routledge, 2006), 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert of Anjou's tomb was created by [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptors Pacio and Giovanni Bertini, who had most likely trained with Tino di Camaino.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 133&lt;/ref&gt; For his monument, erected inside of Santa Chiara, Pacio and Giovanni Bertini represented Robert of Anjou in a relief at the center of the sarcophagus, in a recumbent [[effigy]] on the sarcophagus, and in a free-standing sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 133&lt;/ref&gt; In the free-standing sculpture, Robert is portrayed as an enthroned Roman ruler, much like in Arnolfo di Cambio's statue of his grandfather, Charles I.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In the recumbent effigy, however, Robert is barefoot and wearing a friar's [[tunic]], showing his devotion to the Franciscan order.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In the relief at the center of the sarcophagus, Robert is depicted with members of his royal family, including his successor, his granddaughter [[Joan I of Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 134&lt;/ref&gt; With this funerary monument, Pacio and Giovanni Bertini successfully present an image of both royal and spiritual power, and secure the dynastic claims of future Angevins rulers.

An '''arts district''' is a demarcated urban area, usually on the periphery of a [[city centre]], intended to create a 'critical mass' of places of cultural consumption - such as [[Art gallery|art galleries]], [[Nightclub|dance club]]s, [[Theater (structure)|theatre]]s, [[art cinema]]s, music venues, and public squares for performances. Such an area is usually encouraged by public policy-making and planning, but sometimes occurs spontaneously. It is associated with allied service-industry jobs like cafes, printers, fashion outlets, restaurants, and a variety of 'discreet services' (see the back-page small-ads of almost any cultural events-listings magazine).

There may also be some artists' studios located in nearby back-streets. But, as [[Richard Florida]] has found from his research, cultural production facilities are often better sited some miles away from cultural consumption facilities - except in some very tolerant cities and in countries where a boisterous alcohol-based nightlife scene does not lead to aggressive and anti-social behaviour.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the term sometimes used is "Cultural quarter" or "Arts quarter".

== Types of Arts Districts ==
Steiner and Butler outline five types of arts districts commonly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Frederick|title=Planning and Urban Design Standards|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-76090-0|page=242|author2=Kent Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cultural compounds - tend to be the oldest art districts often established in cities before the 1930s.  These tend to be well-known art districts engrained into the mentality and culture of a community or nation.
# Major Cultural Institutions - large institutions that serve as anchors for an arts district such as large concert halls, playhouses, libraries, or museums.
# Arts and entertainment centers - focus primarily on smaller, popular attractions such as small theaters, private galleries, restaurants, and other entertainment that often has a more bohemian feel than larger more established districts.
# Downtown Arts Districts - occasionally art districts encompass an entire downtown and especially when tourism and walk-ability is the focus of downtown.
# Cultural Production Districts - cultural production districts are characterized by production spaces such as specialized studios, arts centers, and media facilities.  These areas are often tied to affordable studio housing for artists and prioritize the cultural life of the neighborhood.

'''Bernadette Corporation''' is a [[New York City]] and [Paris]- based art and fashion collective founded in 1994. Core members include Bernadette van Huy, [[John Kelsey (artist)|John Kelsey]], and Antek Walzcak. Bernadette Corporation is known for its performance, fashion, and art which in varying ways emulates and disturbs corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/24/bernadette-corporation-ica "Bernadette Corporation: Don't have sex with each other."] ''The Guardian''. March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Influences from fashion to film include [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Malcolm McLaren]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]].  The group is often described in terms of the [[Situationist]] movement.

==History==
When Bernadette Corporation first formed, they were hired to organize parties at downtown nightclubs. They quickly began making fashion and took part in the world of 1990s underground fashion. In the 1990s, their clothes were published in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''Purple'', ''Visionaire'', ''Index Magazine'', and ''[[Artforum]]''. They take influences from the "three Bs"; [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/bernadette-corporation-1|title=Bernadette Corporation|website=frieze.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 1990s, Bernadette Corporation became more productive as a publishing, film, and video group, briefly publishing the magazine ''Made in USA'', named after the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film of the same name. 

In 2001 Bernadette Corporation temporarily merged with Le Parti Imaginaire to make the film ''Get Rid of Yourself'', which retains both fiction and documentary elements. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernadettecorporation.com/introduction.htm Introduction to Bernadette Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bernadette Corporation's other films include; ''The B.C. Corporate Story,'' ''Hell Frozen Over,'' and ''Get Rid of Yourself.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=10164 Electronic Arts Intermix films listing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, Chris.

==Bernadette Van Huy==
Bernadette van Huy is a New York based artist and one of the founding members of Bernadette Corporation. She moved to Manhattan at the age of 23 at which point she began to organise parties in New York nightclubs. She is one of the two currently active members of the collective along with John Kelsey&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/24/bernadette-corporation-ica "Bernadette Corporation at Stedelijk Museum

[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Third Volume of a 1727 edition of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' printed by Jacob Tonson]]

A '''biography''', or simply '''bio''', is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or [[curriculum vitae]] ([[résumé]]), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.

Biographical works are usually [[non-fiction]], but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the [[genre]] known as biography.

An '''authorized biography''' is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An '''[[autobiography]]''' is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or [[ghostwriter]].

== History ==
At first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kendall}}

=== Historical biography&lt;!--'Historical biography' redirects here--&gt; ===
[[File:Einhard.jpg|thumb|right|Einhard as scribe]]

One of the earliest biographers was [[Cornelius Nepos]], who published his work ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae'' ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by [[Plutarch]], in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators [[Demosthenes]] and [[Cicero]], or the generals [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]]; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is [[The Twelve Caesars|''De vita Caesarum'']] ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by [[Suetonius]], written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]].

In the early [[Middle Ages]] (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Hermit]]s, [[monk]]s, and [[priest]]s used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the [[Church Fathers|church father]]s, [[martyr]]s, [[pope]]s, and [[saint]]s. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]] (see [[Hagiography]]). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the [[Vita Karoli Magni|life of Charlemagne]] by his courtier [[Einhard]].

In [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islamic Civilization]] (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of [[Muhammad]] and other important figures in the early [[history of Islam]] began to be written, beginning the [[Prophetic biography]] tradition. Early [[Biographical dictionary|biographical dictionaries]] were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the [[prophets of Islam]] and [[Sahaba|their companions]], with one of these early examples being ''[[The book of The Major Classes (book)|The Book of The Major Classes]]'' by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.{{sfn|Nawas|2006|p=110}}

[[File:Foxe's Book of Martyrs - Frontispiece (1761).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', was one of the earliest English-language biographies.]]
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of [[monarch|king]]s, [[knight]]s, and [[tyrant]]s began to appear. The most famous of such biographies was ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by Sir [[Thomas Malory]]. The book was an account of the life of the fabled [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Following Malory, the new emphasis on [[humanism]] during the [[Renaissance]] promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.

[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the ''Lives'' became an early "bestseller". Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century and the gradual increase in [[literacy]].

Biographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), better known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by [[Thomas Fuller]]'s ''The History of the Worthies of England'' (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.

Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC ''A General History of the Robberies &amp; Murders of the most Notorious Pirates'', by Charles Johnson]. Introduction and commentary by [[David Cordingly]]. Conway Maritime Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The American biography followed the English model, incorporating [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}{{sfn|Stone|1982}}{{clear}}

=== Emergence of the genre ===
[[File:James Boswell of Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|[[James Boswell]] wrote what many consider to be the first modern biography, ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', in 1791.]]

The first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters [[Samuel Johnson]] published in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |title=James Boswell's 'Life of Johnson': The First Modern Biography |last=Butler |first=Paul |date=19 April 2012 |website=University of Mary Washington Libraries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111164251/http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |archive-date=11 November 2014 |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern [[genre]] of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the [[English language]]. Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brocklehurst |first1=Steven |date=16 May 2013 |title=James Boswell: The Man who Re-Invented Biography |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-22540020 |website=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar [[hagiography|hagiographical]] method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of [[saint]]s produced in [[Medieval era|Medieval]] times. A distinction between mass biography and [[Biography in literature|literary biography]] began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and [[middle-class]] culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable [[paperback]] editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. [[Periodical]]s began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}

[[Autobiography|Autobiographies]] became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], (his ''Autobiography'' appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Literary Gossip |newspaper=The Week |location=Toronto |date=6 December 1883 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=13 |url = https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n7/mode/1up |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), philosophers, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], churchmen – [[John Henry Newman]] – and entertainers – [[P. T. Barnum]].

=== Modern biography ===
The sciences of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century’s biographies.{{sfn|Stone|1982}} The demise of the [[Great man theory|"great man"]] theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through [[Darwinian]] theories. "Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of [[psychoanalysis]] led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy.{{sfn|Casper|1999}} The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.

[[File:Eminent Victorians title page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' set the standard for 20th century biographical writing, when it was published in 1918.]]
British critic [[Lytton Strachey]] revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'', consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the [[Victorian era]]: [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Thomas Arnold]], and [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Levy (journalist) |date=20 July 2002 |title=A String Quartet in Four Movements |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strachey set out to breathe life into the [[Victorian era]] for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the ''cortège'' of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism." Strachey defied the tradition of "two fat volumes....of undigested masses of material" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a "set of mouth bungled hypocrites". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Jones |first1=Malcolm |date=28 October 2009 |title=Boswell, Johnson, &amp; the Birth of Modern Biography |url=http://www.newsweek.com/boswell-johnson-birth-modern-biography-81357 |magazine=Newsweek |location=New York |issn=0028-9604 |access-date=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included [[Gamaliel Bradford (biographer)|Gamaliel Bradford]], [[André Maurois]], and [[Emil Ludwig]], among others. [[Robert Graves]] (''I, Claudius'', 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies." The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of "celebrity voyeurism", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By [[World War I]], cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical "boom."

The feminist scholar [[Carolyn Gold Heilbrun|Carolyn Heilbrun]] observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of [[Feminism|feminist]] activism. She cited [[Nancy Milford|Nancy Milford's]] 1970 biography ''Zelda'', as the "beginning of a new period of women's biography, because "[only] in 1970 were we ready to read not that [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]] had destroyed [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative." Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of [[May Sarton|May Sarton's]] ''Journal of a Solitude,'' for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding "beauty even in pain" and transforming "rage into spiritual acceptance," but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their "open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life."{{sfn|Heilbrun|1988|pp=12, 13}}

===Recent years===
In recent years, [[multimedia]] biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary [[biographical film]]s, [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[The Biography Channel]], and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].

CD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist [[Ralph Ueltzhoeffer]]. Media scholar [[Lev Manovich]] says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways.{{sfn|Manovich|2001|p=220}} General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.{{sfn|Hughes|2009|p=159}}

In recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfson College at Oxford University, [[Hermione Lee]] argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result  biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; it will be the way they remembered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Stephen Frears|Frears, Stephen]]; [[Katie Derham|Derham, Katie]]; [[Hermione Lee|Lee, Hermione]]; [[Ray Monk|Monk, Ray]] |title=The Art of Life: Are Biographies Fiction? |url=http://iai.tv/video/the-art-of-life |publisher=Institute of Arts and Ideas |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.{{sfn|Regard|2003}}

Daniel R. Meister in 2017 argues that:
:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. Meister, "The biographical turn and the case for historical biography" ''History Compass'' (Dec. 2017) DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12436 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12436/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical research===
[[Biographical research]] is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials".{{sfn|Roberts|2002}} The central aim of biographical research is to produce rich descriptions of persons or "conceptualise structural types of actions", which means to "understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked".{{sfn|Zinn|2004|p=3}} This method can be used to understand an individual’s life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.

=== Critical issues ===
There are many largely unacknowledged pitfalls to writing good biographies, and these largely concern the relation between firstly the individual and the context, and, secondly, the private and public. Paul James writes:
{{cquote| The problems with such conventional biographies are manifold. Biographies usually treat the public as a reflection of the private, with the private realm being assumed to be foundational. This is strange given that biographies are most often written about public people who project a ''persona''. That is, for such subjects the dominant passages of the presentation of themselves in everyday life are already formed by what might be called a ‘self-biofication’ process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Paul |title=Closing Reflections: Confronting Contradictions in Biographies of Nations and Peoples |journal=Humanities Research |date=2013 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=124 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3231040/Confronting_Contradictions_in_Biographies_of_Nations_and_Persons_2013_}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Bobby''''' is a 2006 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Emilio Estevez]], and starring an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Joy Bryant]], [[Nick Cannon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Spencer Garrett]], [[Helen Hunt]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Heather Graham]], [[Elijah Wood]] and Estevez himself. The screenplay is a [[fiction]]alized account of the hours leading up to the June 5, 1968 [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|shooting]] of U.S. Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in the kitchen of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]] following his win of the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Democratic presidential primary]] in California.

==Plot synopsis==
The film recreates the ambiance of the era and invokes the hopes inspired by Kennedy through the use of actual broadcast and newsfilm footage of the [[United States Senate|senator]] intercut with dramatic sequences involving mostly fictional characters. It uses an ensemble plot device similar to that employed in the 1932 film ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', and by [[Robert Altman]] in ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''.

The characters include John Casey, a retired hotel doorman who spends his days playing chess with his friend Nelson in the lobby; Diane, who is marrying her friend William with the hope his marital status will have him [[Military deployment|deployed]] to a [[military base]] in [[Germany]] rather than the [[Vietnam War|battlefields]] of [[Vietnam]] when his [[tour of duty]] begins; Virginia Fallon, an alcoholic singer whose career is on the downswing, her put-upon husband/manager Tim, and her agent Phil; Miriam Ebbers, a beautician who works in the hotel salon, and her husband Paul, the hotel manager, who is having an affair with [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] operator Angela; food and beverage manager Daryl Timmons, whose racist attitude gets him fired; [[African American]] [[sous chef]] Edward Robinson and [[Mexican American]] [[busboy]]s José and Miguel; hotel coffee shop waitress Susan; Jimmy and Cooper, campaign volunteers who are sidetracked by an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] trip they take with the help of drug dealer Fisher; married socialites and campaign donors Samantha and Jack; campaign manager Wade and staffer Dwayne, who is in love with Angela's colleague, Patricia; and [[Czechoslovakian]] reporter Lenka Janáčková, who is determined to get an interview with Kennedy. 

At the end of the film, Kennedy is shot by [[Sirhan Sirhan]] after giving his acceptance speech, and is cradled and protected by Jose until help arrives. As Kennedy's speech "[[On the Mindless Menace of Violence]]," delivered in 1968 to the [[City Club of Cleveland|City Club]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is played over the aftermath, it is revealed that Samantha, Daryl, Cooper, Jimmy and William are among those injured by Sirhan's wild firing. Sirhan is apprehended, while Kennedy is rushed into an ambulance (as are the others eventually), and everyone else is moved by the events that have just taken place. Closing titles reveal that Kennedy died of his injuries the following morning with his wife [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel]] at his side, and the other victims of the shooting survived.

==Production==

===Development===
In ''Bobby: The Making of an American Epic'', screenwriter/director [[Emilio Estevez]] discusses the problems he had developing his script. Suffering from [[writer's block]], he checked into a motel in [[Pismo Beach]] where he hoped, free from interruption, he could make some headway with his writing. While talking to the woman working at the front desk, he discovered she had been in the Ambassador Hotel on the evening Kennedy was shot, and later married two young men to help them avoid the draft. Estevez used her experience to mold the character of Diane, and the rest of the story fell into place.

The five other characters "shot" in the assassination scene do not coincide with the five actual victims&amp;mdash;William Weisel of [[ABC News]], Paul Schrade of the [[United Auto Workers]] union, Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans, Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service and 17-year-old Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900110-3,00.html |title=A Life On The Way To Death |work=TIME |date=1968-06-14 |accessdate=2018-01-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501101804/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C900110-3%2C00.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other character based on a real person is busboy José, who represents Juan Romero, the young man who was photographed cradling Kennedy's body immediately after he was shot. The character of José has tickets to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] game in which [[Don Drysdale]] is expected to set the record of six consecutive [[shutout]]s, but is obliged to work a double shift, forcing him to miss the game. Drysdale did in fact achieve his sixth shutout on June 4, 1968, and was congratulated by Kennedy during the victory speech he delivered just before being shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Don_Drysdale_1936 |title=Don Drysdale at |publisher=Baseballlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116155328/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Don_Drysdale_1936 |archivedate=2012-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The [[film score]] was composed by [[Mark Isham]], with "Never Gonna Break My Faith" written by [[Bryan Adams]] and performed by [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Mary J. Blige]], and the [[Boys Choir of Harlem]], which was played during the closing credits. Also, a newly recorded version of "[[Louie Louie]]" was performed in character by [[Demi Moore]] for the film.

Songs heard throughout the film consist of a music compilation from the 1960s, including "[[The Tracks of My Tears]]" by [[Smokey Robinson]], "[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]" by [[Stevie Wonder]], "[[Ain't That Peculiar]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]], an original acoustic version of "[[The Sound of Silence]]" by [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], "[[Anji (instrumental)|Anji]]" covered by Jason Huxley, "[[Come See About Me]]" by [[The Supremes]], "[[There's a Kind of Hush]]" by [[Herman's Hermits]], "[[Black Is Black]]" by [[Los Bravos]], "[[Season of the Witch (song)|Season of the Witch]]" and "[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]" by [[Donovan]], "[[Wives and Lovers]]" by [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], "[[Magic Moments]]" by [[Perry Como]], "[[Pata Pata]]" by [[Miriam Makeba]] and "Initials" from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.

The soundtrack album ''Bobby'' features The Supremes, [[Shorty Long]], [[Hugh Masekela]], [[The Moody Blues]] and Los Bravos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/bobby/|title=Bobby Soundtrack (2006)|website=Soundtrack.net|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Christian Slater at the premiere of Bobby, Toronto Film Festival 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|Christian Slater - who played Daryl Timmons in the film - at [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]] for ''Bobby''{{'}}s North American debut.]]
After an initial [[Film premiere|premiere]] at the NUIG Student Cinema at the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]], the film premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Deauville Film Festival]], the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[Vienna International Film Festival]], the [[London Film Festival]], and [[American Film Institute|AFI Fest]] before going into limited release in the US on November 17, 2006, and a wide release in the subsequent week.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Playing on two screens, it grossed $69,039 during its opening weekend. It eventually earned $11,242,801 in North America and $9,461,790 in other territories for a worldwide box office of $20,704,591.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;

==Reception==
''Bobby'' has an approval rating of 46% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 170 reviews; the average score is 5.6 out of 10. The consensus states, "Despite best intentions from director Emilio Estevez and his ensemble cast, they succumb to a script filled with pointless subplots and awkward moments working too hard to parallel contemporary times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1162559-bobby/|title=Bobby|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a score of 54 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 31 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bobby|title=Bobby|website=Metacritic.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that despite the director's "large and honorable task" and "entirely admirable" intentions, "The actors seem more like 'very special guest stars' than like real, 1968-vintage Americans... Some of the stories feel too obviously melodramatic, while others are vague to the point of inscrutability. In the Vietnam- and drug-related plots, the point is hammered home too hard... while other narratives wind toward no discernible point at all. Nonetheless the ambition behind ''Bobby'' is large and serious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/movies/17bobb.html|title=Bobby - Review - Movies|first=A. O.|last=Scott|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Crust of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "an ambitious film drenched in sincerity and oozing with nostalgia that, despite the energy provided by its title icon via archival footage, falls flat dramatically in nearly every other way. It aspires for the [[Robert Altman|Altmanesque]] interplay of ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' or ''[[Short Cuts]]'' but instead feels like one of those '70s disaster epics such as ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' or ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', in which a star-studded cast endures melodramatic story lines as the audience awaits the inevitable momentous event and tries to guess who will be around at the finish . . . It's easy to become swept up in the palpable enthusiasm Estevez shows toward his subject, but the pedestrian and overly expositional dialogue of the film's characters proves to be as stifling as the excerpts from Kennedy's speeches are stirring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makinen |first=Julie |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-bobby17nov17,0,7778372.story |title= Los Angeles Times' review |publisher=Calendarlive.com  |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Young of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said of Estevez, "Stepping up as writer and director in a way he never has before, [he] successfully pulls together a complexly designed narrative," and added the film "carries an eerie topicality that makes many of its insights instantly click."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117931460.html|title=Review of Bobby - Variety.com|date=12 April 2008|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412140503/http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117931460.html|archivedate=12 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armond White]] of ''[[New York Press]]'' wrote that the film "has a humane sweetness", and that it "literally and vividly unites different ethnic groups, labor strata and social castes" in a way that "is not schematic—its exactitude and believability has a Tocquevillian brilliance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/article-15091-healing-with-hope.html Healing with Hope], Armond White, ''New York Press'', December 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Persall of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' graded the film C, calling it "a misguided jumble of too much fiction, few facts and zero speculation" and Estevez "a mediocre filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/11/22/Floridian/_Bobby__is__a_misnome.shtml |title= St. Petersburg Times'review |publisher=SPTimes.com  |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Medved]], who was in the Ambassador ballroom (20 feet from the podium) the night Kennedy was shot, awarded the film three out of four stars and called it "intriguing but imperfect." He added, "Emilio Estevez gets most of the feelings of the occasion right. But, the melodramatic, multi-character format proves somewhat uneven and distracting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/bobby.doc]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] said, "Estevez writes and directs with lots of passion, not so much subtlety . . . [He] wants the movie to be on the level of a Robert Altman film like ''Nashville'' but falls short."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&amp;subsec=BOBBY|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080924205145/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&amp;subsec=BOBBY|deadurl=yes|title=At the Movies|date=24 September 2008|archivedate=24 September 2008|website=Archive.is|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film one star and called it "trite fiction" and a work of "insipid ineptitude." He ranked it among the worst films of 2006, as did Lou Lumerick of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who dubbed it an "ambitious, but utterly wrong-headed trivialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/9740235/review/12583294/bobby |title=''Rolling Stone'' review |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhist music''' is music created for or inspired by [[Buddhism]] and part of [[Buddhist art]].

==Honkyoku==
[[Honkyoku]] (本曲) are the pieces of [[shakuhachi]] or [[hocchiku]] music played by wandering Japanese Zen monks called [[Komuso]]. Komuso temples were abolished in 1871, but their music, honkyoku, is one of the most popular contemporary music styles in Japan. Komuso played honkyoku for enlightenment and alms as early as the 13th century. In the 18th century, a Komuso named [[Kinko Kurosawa]] of the Fuke sect of [[Zen Buddhism]] was commissioned to travel throughout Japan and collect these musical pieces. The results of several years of travel and compilation were thirty-six pieces known as the [[Honkyoku#Kinko_Ryū|Kinko-Ryu Honkyoku]].

==Chanting==
The [[Buddhist chant|chanting]] of mantras used in or inspired by Buddhism, including many genres in many cultures:
   
*[[repetition (music)|Repetition]] of the name of [[Amitabha]] in [[Pure Land Buddhism]].   
*Repetitious [[chanting]] of [[Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]] and excerpts of the [[Lotus Sutra]] within [[Nichiren Buddhism]] 
*Shomyo in Japanese [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] Buddhism.    
*[[Overtone singing|Throat singing]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] chants  
    
===Tibetan styles===
Tibetan Buddhism is the most widespread religion in Tibet. Musical chanting, most often in Tibetan or Sanskrit, is an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Individual schools such as the Gelug, Nyingma, Sakya and Kagyu, and even individual monasteries, maintain their own chant traditions.

===Shomyo===
[[Shomyo]] (声明) is a style of Japanese [[Buddhist chant]]; mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

'''Cochin ware''', or '''Jiaozhi ware''' ({{zh|t=交趾陶|p=Jiāozhǐ táo}}) is a type of [[Chinese pottery]] from [[Guangdong]] Province, southern China.

== History ==
It was brought to [[Taiwan]] in the 19th century. 

The English term "Cochin" derives from the Chinese word ''[[Jiāozhǐ]]'' (交趾), which was used to describe various parts of the south, including [[Vietnam]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Giao-chỉ''). The region of [[Cochinchina]] is an example of the term.

At that time, Cochin ware consisted mainly of decorations for the walls and roof ridges of temples, including human figures, animals, birds, and flowers in bright, glossy colors. Today, there are only a handful of craftspeople who still possess the traditional Cochin skills, most of whom are in the central-island city of [[Chiayi]].

== Japan ==
In Japan it is known as '''Kōchi ware''' (''Kōchi-yaki''). In the old capital city [[Kyoto]] the masters of the [[tea ceremony]] esteem Kōchi ware as small figures of animals, fish, flowers, dragons, the phoenix etc. Initially imported as ''[[shimamono]]'', it became a part of [[Japanese pottery]]. The Koshun kiln (洸春窯) is also a production centre in Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kyotoartisans.jp/en/2016/02/02/koshungama/&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as "Suterisms"&lt;ref name=People /&gt; or "visual [[koans]]",&lt;ref name=3x3&gt;[http://3x3mag.com/about/currentissue "Current Issue,"] ''3x3 Magazine''. Accessed Dec. 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; his illustrations are notable for their use of [[bistable perception]], in which Suter combines multiple images and concepts into a single image.&lt;ref name=People&gt;Van Biema, David H. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20092214,00.html "Look Twice! Illustrator David Suter Uses Visual Puns to Make His Points,"] ''People'' Vol. 24, No. 21  (November 18, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Suter is also an accomplished fine art painter and sculptor.

== Biography and illustration career ==
Suter grew up in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], the son of Richard Sturgis Suter, who worked in the CIA, and Angela Phillips Suter, an artist.  He was influenced early on by the [[Mathematical art|mathematically]] inspired work of [[M. C. Escher]],&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt; but never had any formal art training.&lt;ref name=People /&gt;

Suter attended a number of different colleges, not graduating from any of them.&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt;  Drafted into the [[U.S. Army|Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]], he spent his deployment in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt; t
Upon returning to the U.S., Suter got work at ''The Washington Post'' as an illustrator, for a while working as a [[courtroom artist]] during the [[Watergate scandal]] trials.&lt;ref name=Jenkins1 /&gt;

Suter was awarded a [[Michigan Journalism Fellowship]] in 1977, where he spent a year studying fine art, philosophy, and history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjfellows.org/fellows/1978.html "Past Fellows: 1977–1978,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028152543/http://www.mjfellows.org/fellows/1978.html |date=2015-10-28 }} Knight-Wallace Fellows at Michigan website. Accessed Dec. 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Michigan]]. Upon completion of the fellowship, in 1978, Suter moved to New York City to pursue editorial illustration full-time. He quickly become sought-after by such publications as ''The New York Times'' (both on the [[op-ed page]] and [[The New York Times Book Review|the book review]]), ''Time'' magazine (for whom he did a number of covers), ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=3x3 /&gt;

In a mid-1980s magazine profile, Suter described his work this way:
{{cquote|I don't think of them as puns. I like to think of them as equations. Every story suggests a certain number of images. And then there are other images, the visual clichés that are in everybody's mind and sort of make up their mental scenery, like [[the Pentagon]], the [[Statue of Liberty]], or the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. My mind is like a [[slot machine]]: You pull the lever and eventually one of the images from the article comes to rest next to a cliché that looks something like it. . . . It's a little like [[algebra]]. I try to combine the two images through a process of finding similarities and canceling out dissimilar aspects.&lt;ref name=People /&gt;}}

For many years, Suter has been working on creating a full-length animation of the complete text of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Jerelle. ''All the Art That's Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn't): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page'' (Columbia University Press, 2013), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s he retired from editorial illustration to work full-time on his painting and sculpture practices.

== Fine art ==
The first exhibition of Suter's fine art — which he terms "[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] [[Expressionist art|Expressionist]]"&lt;ref name=Jenkins1&gt;Jenkins, Mark. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/painter-and-sculpter-david-suters-homespun-art-at-gallery-a/2011/11/16/gIQAKoTrVN_story.html "Style: Painter and sculpter &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; David Suter’s homespun art at Gallery A,"] ''The Washington Post'' (November 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; — was in 1996 at the Morgan Rank Gallery in [[East Hampton, New York]].&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt; He is represented by Gallery A and Alex Gallery in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Jenkins2&gt;Jenkins, Mark.

In 2011, he was arrested and detained in [[Serbia]] while transporting his paintings from [[France]] to [[Romania]] for a gallery show in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Print&gt;Heller, Steven.

== Personal life ==
Suter has four daughters: Valerie, Georgia, Charlotte and Olivia.&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt;

== Quotes ==
{{cquote|He doesn't simply create a striking accompaniment to the text, like most of my artists. His method actually transforms the author's argument into a new visual symbol. . . . No one can do them like him.

{{cquote|Even his mediocre things are good, and his best things are brilliant.
— [[Steven Heller (design writer)|Steven Heller]]&lt;ref name=People /&gt;}}

{{cquote|In some cases David gets to the essence of a subject more quickly and economically than the writer. If people say it's visual trickery, it's bloody good visual trickery. His work will stand up.

'''Ewigkeit''' is the musical project of English artist [[James Fogarty]] aka Mr. Fog from [[Brighton]]. Having released five studio albums, on 28 March 2007, Fogarty announced the end of the project on Blabbermouth, the Death To Music website and also on Myspace&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathtomusic.com/ewigindex.htm Deathtomusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but revived it in 2012.&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/artist/416439-Ewigkeit Ewigkeit] at www.discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Band history==
The purpose of this one-man project was to try and forge a unique musical sound.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;[http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/artist/ewigkeit Ewigkeit] at www.metalmusicarchives.com&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of the first album, ''Battle Furies'' on a short-lived [[Neat Records]] subsidiary called Eldethorn, Fogarty gave his entire music collection away to an [[Oxfam]] charity shop so that he would be free of influences creating his next work.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt; ''Starscape'' was received well by the extreme music press, but label folded and the project was put on hiatus. During the missing years, Ewigkeit concentrated on his other black metal project [[The Meads of Asphodel]] and his collaboration with Jimmy Cauty on the multi-media project Blacksmoke.&lt;ref name="deathtomusic"&gt;[http://www.deathtomusic.com/BTB/btb.html Ewigkeit] at www.deathtomusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 ''Land of Fog'', was eventually released on Metal Age Productions. Fogarty himself regarded this as the first Ewigkeit album, and it gained him enough attention to get his project signed to [[Earache Records]], on which ''[[Radio Ixtlan]]'' was released in 2004, to considerable acclaim.&lt;ref name="deathtomusic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Taylor [http://exclaim.ca/music/article/ewigkeit-radio_ixtlan Radio Ixtlan] the Exclaim! review&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in 2005, ''[[Conspiritus]]'' (mixed by John Fryer), a conceptual album examining conspiracy theories, has been hailed by many as "marking a maturation of Ewigkeit's eclectic sound."&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt; Also in 2005, a [[music video]] was made in collaboration with film-maker Anthony Gates for the track "Its Not Reality".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ju9VO36vM Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Ewigkeit made a live video recording entitled ''Ewigkeit - Live From A Bunker''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.earache.com/news_stories/ewigkeit.html&lt;/ref&gt;, which displayed the project in a live setting acting as a free "online" gig - the 25 minute set (filmed in a [[bunker|Nuclear Bunker]] in the vicinity of Brighton, England) was uploaded to [[Google video]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=5859630464124644924&amp;hl=en-GB Video.google.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119071124/http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=5859630464124644924&amp;hl=en-GB |date=19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also recorded was a free download [[MP3]] [[Extended play|EP]], ''Return to the Land of Fog''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earache.com/bands/ewigkeit/lof/land_of_fog.html Ewigkeit] at Earache.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Fogerty burned all his [[recording contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Ok-cFj0Wk Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt; All previous Ewigkeit material was then made available at www.deathtomusic.com. In January 2007, Death to Music Productions gave away a remastered and superior version of ''Battle Furies''. In March 2007, ''Starscape'' was available free, with the intention that all material will be fully released online.

In March 2007, James Fogarty abandoned the Ewigkeit project, stating in the press-release, "... [metal] is mostly out-of-date, out-of-touch with its origins and (worst of all) conservative in the extreme..."&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

An online link to Fogerty's new project, The Bombs of Enduring Freedom, was created with the debut self-titled album released in December 2007, and an EP ''Kalashikovs and Car Bombs'', followed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/artist/1104371-The-Bombs-Of-Enduring-Freedom  The Bombs of Enduring Freedom] at www.discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he also produced the Old Forest album ''Tales of the Sussex Weald''.&lt;ref name="deathtomusic"/&gt;

In 2012 Ewigkeit was reactivated, with a black metal sound, and two more studio albums were released: ''Back to Beyond'' in August 2012, and ''Cosmic Man'' (July 2017).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Ewigkeit/6150 Ewigkeit] at www.metal-archives.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discogs"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Ewigkeit was the name given to this music project when Fogerty found the word in the English Concise Oxford Dictionary. A little known "imported" word, hardly used in the English language at all, Ewigkeit means 'eternity' in [[German language|German]]. He has been known in interviews to say that in retrospect, it was the worst name he could have chosen.

The '''''Exploding Plastic Inevitable''''', sometimes simply called '''''Plastic Inevitable''''' or '''''EPI''''', was a series of [[multimedia]] events organized by [[Andy Warhol]] between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[Nico]], screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's [[The Factory|Factory]], especially [[Mary Woronov]] and [[Gerard Malanga]]. ''Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' is also the title of an 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called ''The Plastic Exploding Inevitable'' as part of the ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' No. 3 package.&lt;ref name=Aspen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From the research laboratories of Andy Warhol comes this issue of Aspen Magazine |date=April 1967 |url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/advertisements/aspen3Ad.html |journal=[[Evergreen Review]] |volume=11 |issue=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable with Nico.png|thumb|left|170px|Performance of Exploding Plastic Inevitable in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]]]
The ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' had its beginnings in an event staged on January 13, 1966, at a dinner for the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry. This event, called "Up-Tight", included performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico, along with Malanga and [[Edie Sedgwick]] as dancers&lt;ref name=BWJ&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Branden W. |last=Joseph |authorlink=Branden W.

==Legacy==
{{unsourced section|date=January 2017}}
[[Andy Warhol]]'s lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered many innovations that have since become standard practice in rock music light shows. From May 27–29 the '''''EPI''''' played [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, where Williams built a light show including [[stroboscope|stroboscopes]], slides and film projections onstage. At [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s request he was soon to come back and build more. Film maker [[Jonas Mekas]] (who pioneered film projections during concerts at New York's Cinematheque), Andy Warhol and Danny Williams' influential ideas contributed much to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium's prestige and were also used at the [[Fillmore East]] and [[Fillmore West]], both opening in 1968.

[[File:François Cellier by Ellis and Walery.jpg|thumb|Cellier, by [[Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg#Photographic career|Ellis and Walery]], c.1890]]

'''François Arsène Cellier''' (14 December 1849&amp;ndash;5 January 1914), often called '''Frank''', was an English conductor and composer. He is known for his tenure as musical director and conductor of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] during the original runs and early revivals of the [[Savoy opera]]s.

Succeeding his elder brother [[Alfred Cellier|Alfred]] as the company's chief conductor in 1878, Cellier devoted almost all the rest of his life to [[comic opera]]. He was musical director for the original runs of nine [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas and fourteen full-length pieces by other writers at the [[Savoy Theatre]] between 1881 and 1902. He composed songs and also some short [[curtain raisers]] that were well received but have rarely been revived.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Cellier was born in [[South Hackney]], London, the youngest of the five children of Arsène Cellier, a language teacher from France, and his wife Mary Ann Peterine, formerly Peacock, ''né'' Thomsett.&lt;ref name=ancestry&gt;[https://search.ancestryinstitution.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=allgs&amp;gss=sfs28_ms_f-2_s&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Francois%20Arsene&amp;gsfn_x=1&amp;gsln=Cellier&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;MSAV=0&amp;uidh=aqs François Cellier"], Ancestry Institution, [[Wellcome Library]], accessed 20 January 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed his eldest brother [[Alfred Cellier|Alfred]] as a chorister at the [[Chapel Royal#St_James's_Palace|Chapel Royal, St James's]]. Like his brother and the latter's fellow pupil [[Arthur Sullivan]], François benefited from the tutelage of the Rev [[Thomas Helmore]], who ensured that the choristers received an all-round education in addition to their musical training.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving the choir school at the age of seventeen, Cellier held a series of posts as an organist, first in Belfast, Ireland, and then at the church of St John of Jerusalem, South Hackney, where he had been christened, and in 1870 St Michael's, [[Sydenham|Lower Sydenham]].&lt;ref name=era&gt;"Popular Composers: Mr. François Cellier", ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 12 August 1899, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; After a spell as Sullivan's deputy organist at St Peter's, Cranley Gardens, [[South Kensington]], he moved to St Anne's, [[Surbiton]], where he remained for the rest of his career, in tandem with his theatrical conducting work.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

Cellier married Clara Short in 1873. They had five daughters and a son, François, who became an actor under the name of [[Frank Cellier (actor)|Frank Cellier]] and was the father of the actor [[Peter Cellier]].&lt;ref name=ancestry/&gt;

===Conductor and musical director===
In July 1878 Cellier succeeded his brother Alfred as the conductor of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' during its long run at the [[Opera Comique]], London. He remained as the company's musical director there and, from 1881, at the [[Savoy Theatre]], until 1902, with a break between July 1880 and April 1881, when his brother temporarily resumed the position.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The composer conducted at first nights, but Cellier, as musical director, was the principal conductor for the original runs of ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881&amp;ndash;82), ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882&amp;ndash;84), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885&amp;ndash;87), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888&amp;ndash;89), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889&amp;ndash;91), ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893&amp;ndash;94) and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 8&amp;ndash;15&lt;/ref&gt; As the Savoy's musical director he conducted the London runs of fourteen operas by other authors or composers between 1891 and 1902,&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 13&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; fourteen revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan works, beginning with ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1884 and ending with ''Iolanthe'' in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 9&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar number of curtain-raisers and afterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. X&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed musical-director-in-chief at [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]] for the runs of Sullivan's ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' and [[André Messager|Messager's]] ''[[La Basoche]]'' in 1891&amp;ndash;92.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

In the 1890s Cellier began conducting [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] productions outside London. In 1890 he took charge of the first provincial performances of ''The Gondoliers'',&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1894 he conducted a touring company presenting ''Princess Ida'' and ''Utopia, Limited''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902&amp;ndash;03 he led a D'Oyly Carte tour of South Africa, conducting six Gilbert and Sullivan operas and ''[[The Rose of Persia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly left D'Oyly Carte on his return to England in June 1903. During that month he conducted a one-off matinée performance of his new operetta, ''Bob'' (libretto by the author and journalist Cunningham Bridgeman) at the [[Adelphi Theatre]]. The piece had been premiered in [[Walsall]] in April while he was still in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bob'' was also played by D'Oyly Carte touring companies in 1903&amp;ndash;04.&lt;ref name=bob&gt;Walters, Michael, and George Low. [http://www.gsarchive.net/companions/bob/index.html "Bob"], the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 1996, accessed 20 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1904 Cellier conducted a short-lived comic opera, ''Ladyland'', by Eustace Ponsonby and Frank Lambert at the [[Playhouse Theatre|Avenue Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1905 he rejoined the D'Oyly Carte company, until retiring in 1913, as musical director of the touring repertory company and, at the Savoy, conducting the London repertory seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas in 1906&amp;ndash;07 and 1908&amp;ndash;09.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 21, 22, 121–125 and Appendix p. I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composer, orchestrator and author===
[[File:Old Sarah.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Part of a programme showing Cellier's ''[[Old Sarah]]'' preceding a revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], 1897]]
In addition to ''Bob'', which never played at the Savoy Theatre, Cellier composed music for several [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] that played together with the Savoy Operas (and often also on tour), including ''[[Mrs. Jarramie's Genie]]'' (1888, composed jointly with his brother Alfred, libretto by [[Frank Desprez]]), ''[[Captain Billy]]'' (1891, libretto by [[Harry Greenbank]]), ''[[Old Sarah]]'' (1897, libretto by Greenbank), and ''[[Pretty Polly (opera)|Pretty Polly]]'' (1900, libretto by [[Basil Hood]]).&lt;ref name=bob/&gt; These short pieces have rarely been revived professionally, but they were popular with amateur groups in the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;.

For the ''Children's [[H.M.S. Pinafore|Pinafore]]'' in 1879&amp;ndash;80 and the ''Children's [[The Pirates of Penzance|Pirates]]'' in 1884, Cellier transposed the song keys to fit each individual child's voice. The choruses, especially the string parts, were rearranged so that the children's voices could be heard, and orchestral accompaniment was provided for the normally unaccompanied numbers for the support of the young male voices.&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' commented that although his other commitments left him short of time for composition, as a song-writer Cellier was "very favourably known".&lt;ref name=era/&gt; His published songs in the catalogue of the [[British Library]] are: "From Dawn to Dawn" (words by R. J. Martin, 1898); "Sad 'tis to Part" (words by W. S. Beadle, 1889); "The Polo Song" (words by "Marksman", 1901); "No Fear!" (words by R. J. Martin, 1903); and four songs with words by Bridgeman: "Coquet and Coy" (1887); "Hampton Courtship" (1887); "'Tis For the Best" (1888); and "Men of the Day" (1888). His short [[anthem]], "Holy, Holy, Holy" was published in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?ct=facet&amp;fctN=facet_rtype&amp;fctV=Scores&amp;rfnGrp=1&amp;rfnGrpCounter=1&amp;frbg=&amp;&amp;vl(488279563UI0)=any&amp;fn=search&amp;indx=1&amp;dscnt=0&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&amp;tb=t&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;mode=Basic&amp;ct=search&amp;srt=rank&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dum=true&amp;vl(freeText0)=Francois%20Cellier&amp;dstmp=1516461264878 "François Cellier"], British Library, accessed 20 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellier devoted his brief retirement to writing a book of reminiscences about Gilbert, Sullivan and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (''Gilbert and Sullivan and Their Operas''). He died at his home in [[Kingston upon Thames]] in 1914 before the book was completed, and his collaborator, Bridgeman, completed and published it later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
[[Henry Lytton]] wrote:
{{quote|Cellier had his heart and soul in every performance, and what that means is known only to those who work on the stage, and who do sometimes become dull and listless because of their very familiarity with the parts they are playing or because the audience cannot easily be aroused to 'concert pitch'. ... It is at just such times as these that a real conductor is worth his weight in gold. Notwithstanding that he may have seen the piece hundreds of times &amp;ndash; and might with reason be more bored than the principals themselves &amp;ndash; he comes to each new performance with an enthusiasm which shakes the company out of themselves and makes everything go with a will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/lytton_secrets/ch7.html Lytton, Henry. ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922)]&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Cellier's collaborator Bridgeman wrote of his friend's dedication to the music of Arthur Sullivan and Alfred Cellier, to the exclusion, Bridgeman felt, of all other music. Sullivan willed to Cellier the original manuscript scores for ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Mr François Cellier", ''The Times'', 7 January 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Bridgeman, and the anonymous author of ''The Era's'' profile, considered, as Lytton did, that Cellier's natural talent could have equipped him to rival the creative success of at least one of his two musical idols, but that indolence and lack of ambition prevented it.&lt;ref name=era/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridgeman in Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Both those sources agree that Cellier's conducting technique was unshowy and strictly practical, and he took pleasure in being known as "the musician who conducts in English".&lt;ref name=era/&gt;

'''Georges Hulin de Loo''' (10 December 1862, in [[Ghent]] – 27 December 1945, in [[Brussels]]) was a Belgian art historian specialising in [[Early Netherlandish art]]. He was educated in his home city of Ghent where he attended high school and university, earning a Ph.D from the Faculty of Arts in 1883, and a degree in law three years later. He then traveled to Germany and Paris to continue his studies, returning to Ghent in 1889 to take up a teaching position the [[University of Ghent]] in a variety of subjects such as logic and law.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/hulindeloog.htm Hulin de Loo] ''Dictionary of Art Historians''. Retrieved 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After visiting the [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|1902 Bruges exhibition of Netherlandish art]] (''Exposition de tableaux flamands des XIVe, XVe et XVIe siècles'') he published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He went on to become a leading scholar in the field.&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos"&gt;Ridderbos, Bernhard; Van Buren, Anne; Van Veen, Henk. ''Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception and Research''. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89236-816-0}}, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a separate introduction to the catalogue in which he speculated about the painters' identities (''De l’identité de certains maîtres anonymes''), followed by publications about [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Jan Provoost]]. He was the first art historian to suggest that [[Robert Campin]] was in the fact the painter known as the Master of Flemalle and to identify [[Roger van der Weyden]] as an apprentice to Campin.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt;

In 1911 he studied and published a study of the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] suggesting a number of miniatures were painted by [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]], an assertion which continues to be a contentious issue among art historians.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt;
 
Hulin became active in the art community, sat on committees and associations, and was a consulting editor to ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]''. He continued in his teaching position at Ghent University, however, when in 1930 the university became a Flemish speaking institution, he retired soon after.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt; He continued to write, publishing a biography of Roger van der Weyden in 1938.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt; Along with [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]], who also visited the 1902 Bruges exhibition and wrote a review, Hulin became a leading scholar in the field of Netherlandish art.&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos"/&gt;

He died unmarried and without children in 1945.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt;

The '''Great Torc from Snettisham''' or ''Snettisham Great Torc'' is a large, Iron Age [[electrum]] [[torc]] or neck-ring that is the most spectacular object in the [[Snettisham Hoard]] of [[Iron Age]] torcs and other metalwork found near the village of [[Snettisham]] in [[Norfolk]], [[East Anglia]].  The perfectly intact torc is outstanding for its high level of craftsmanship and superb artistry. Soon after its discovery this elaborate collar was acquired by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_great_torc_from_snettisham.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The [[torc]] was accidentally found in 1950 by a farmer ploughing a field at Ken Hill near the village of Snettisham. It had been buried with a bracelet and coin, which helped to date the torc to around 75&amp;nbsp;BC. Many other Iron Age hoards have since been found in the vicinity, but the Great Torc is considered by archaeologists to be the most important find from Snettisham. Declared [[treasure trove]] soon after its discovery, the torc was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the [[National Art Collections Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=828315&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Torc+snettisham&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The Great Torc from Snettisham, which weighs just over a kilogram, is mostly made of gold alloyed with a small part of silver. The torc was made in two ways: complex threads of metal were grouped into ropes and twisted around each other to create the [[crescent]] shaped necklace; the ends of the torc were cast in moulds with [[La Tène]] designs and [[welded]] onto the metal ropes to create the whole composition. Given the large amount of precious metals found at the site, in addition to the sophisticated design of luxurious jewellery such as this, it has been conjectured that the area around Snettisham may have been connected with royalty from the [[Iceni]] tribe, that was based in this part of England at the time.

'''History painting''' is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than artistic style. History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait.  The term is derived from the wider senses of the word ''historia'' in Latin and Italian, meaning  "story" or "narrative", and essentially means "story painting". Most history paintings are not of scenes from [[history]], especially paintings from before about 1850.

In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.

History paintings almost always contain a number of figures, often a large number, and normally show some type of action that is a moment in a narrative. The genre includes depictions of moments in religious narratives, above all the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', as well as narrative scenes from [[mythology]], and also [[allegorical]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/history-painting National Gallery, Glossary entry]; [http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg61/gg61-main1.html History Painting Gallery] from The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; Green and Seddon, 7-8; Harrison, 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were for long the most frequently painted; works such as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] are therefore history paintings, as are most very large paintings before the 19th century. The term covers large paintings in [[oil on canvas]] or [[fresco]] produced between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, after which the term is generally not used even for the many works that still meet the basic definition.&lt;ref&gt;Green and Seddon, 11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

History painting may be used interchangeably with '''historical painting''', and was especially so used before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History painting|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/History+painting|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where a distinction is made "historical painting" is the painting of scenes from secular history, whether specific episodes or generalized scenes.  In the 19th century historical painting in this sense became a distinct genre. In phrases such as "historical painting materials", "historical" means in use before about 1900, or some earlier date.

History paintings were traditionally regarded as the highest form of Western painting, occupying the most prestigious place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and considered the equivalent to the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in literature. In his  ''[[De Pictura]]'' of 1436, [[Leon Battista Alberti]] had argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12; Barlow, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

This view remained general until the 19th century, when artistic movements began to struggle against the establishment institutions of [[academic art]], which continued to adhere to it. At the same time there was from the latter part of the 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to [[military art|battle-scenes]] and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the [[early Renaissance]], and once again became common in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods, and still more so with the rise of [[Neoclassicism]]. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious narratives, literature or mythology.

==Development==
The term is generally not used in art history in speaking of medieval painting, although the Western tradition was developing in large [[altarpiece]]s, fresco cycles, and other works, as well as [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscripts]]. It comes to the fore in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], where a series of increasingly ambitious works were produced, many still religious, but several, especially in Florence, which did actually feature near-contemporary historical scenes such as the set of three huge canvases on ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' by Michelangelo and the ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], neither of which were completed. Scenes from ancient history and mythology were also popular. Writers such as Alberti and the following century [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', followed public and artistic opinion in judging the best painters above all on their production of large works of history painting (though in fact the only modern (post-classical) work described in ''[[De Pictura]]'' is [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic).  Artists continued for centuries to strive to make their reputation by producing such works, often neglecting genres to which their talents were better suited.

[[File:Angelo Bronzino 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', [[Agnolo Bronzino]], c. 1545. According to [[André Félibien]] allegory was the highest form of all history painting.]]

There was some objection to the term, as many writers preferred terms such as "poetic painting" (''poesia''), or wanted to make a distinction between the "true" ''istoria'', covering history including biblical and religious scenes, and the ''fabula'', covering pagan myth, allegory, and scenes from fiction, which could not be regarded as true.&lt;ref&gt;See Reynolds below; nonetheless he bowed to convention: "In conformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting; it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is." (''Discources'', IV); for debates over terminology in the Italian Renaissance, see Bull, 391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The large works of [[Raphael]] were long considered, with those of Michelangelo, as the finest models for the genre.

In the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], allegories and historical scenes are mixed together, and the [[Raphael Cartoons]] show scenes from the Gospels, all in the [[Grand Manner]] that from the [[High Renaissance]] became associated with, and often expected in, history painting. In the Late Renaissance and [[Baroque]] the painting of actual history tended to degenerate into panoramic battle-scenes with the victorious monarch or general perched on a horse accompanied with his retinue, or formal scenes of ceremonies, although some artists managed to make a masterpiece from such unpromising material, as [[Velázquez]] did with his ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]''.

An influential formulation of the hierarchy of genres, confirming the history painting at the top, was made in 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the late 18th century, with both religious and mytholological painting in decline, there was an increased demand for paintings of scenes from history, including contemporary history. This was in part driven by the changing audience for ambitious paintings, which now increasingly made their reputation in public exhibitions rather than by impressing the owners of and visitors to palaces and public buildings. Classical history remained popular, but scenes from national histories were often the best-received. From 1760 onwards, the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], the first body to organize regular exhibitions in London, awarded two generous prizes each year to paintings of subjects from British history.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 17, and 32-34 and generally on growth of historical painting.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770), an early example of the vogue for painting scenes from recent history.]]

The unheroic nature of modern dress was regarded as a serious difficulty. When, in 1770, [[Benjamin West]] proposed to paint ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in contemporary dress, he was firmly instructed to use classical costume by many people. He ignored these comments and showed the scene in modern dress. Although [[George III]] refused to purchase the work, West succeeded both in overcoming his critics' objections and inaugurating a more historically accurate style in such paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenstein, 16-17; Strong, 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists depicted scenes, regardless of when they occurred, in classical dress and for a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depictions of the heroic male nude.

The large production, using the finest French artists, of propaganda paintings glorifying the exploits of [[Napoleon]], were matched by works, showing both victories and losses, from the anti-Napoleonic alliance by artists such as [[Goya]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]]. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818–1819) was a sensation, appearing to update the history painting for the 19th century, and showing anonymous figures famous only for being victims of what was then a famous and controversial disaster at sea. Conveniently their clothes had been worn away to classical-seeming rags by the point the painting depicts. At the same time the demand for traditional large religious history paintings very largely fell away.
[[File:David Wilkie Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Waterloo Dispatch.jpg|thumb|300px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'', 1822. Genre or history painting? The types have merged, in a way typical of the 19th century.]]

In the mid-nineteenth century there arose a style known as [[historicism (art)|historicism]], which marked a formal imitation of historical styles and/or artists. Another development in the nineteenth century was the treatment of historical subjects, often on a large scale, with the values of [[Genre works|genre painting]], the depiction of scenes of everyday life, and [[anecdote]]. Grand depictions of events of great public importance were supplemented with scenes depicting more personal incidents in the lives of the great, or of scenes centred on unnamed figures involved in historical events, as in the [[Troubadour style]]. At the same time scenes of ordinary life with moral, political or satirical content became often the main vehicle for expressive interplay between figures in painting, whether given a modern or historical setting.

By the later 19th century, history painting was often explicitly rejected by [[avant-garde]] movements such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] (except for [[Édouard Manet]]) and the [[Symbolist]]s, and according to one recent writer "[[Modernism]] was to a considerable extent built upon the rejection of History Painting... All other genres are deemed capable of entering, in one form or another, the 'pantheon' of modernity considered, but History Painting is excluded".&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The terms===
Initially, "history painting" and "historical painting" were used interchangeably in English, as when Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in his fourth ''Discourse'' uses both indiscriminately to cover "history painting", while saying "...it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is", reflecting the French term ''peinture historique'', one equivalent of "history painting".  The terms began to separate in the 19th century, with "historical painting" becoming a sub-group of "history painting" restricted to subjects taken from history in its normal sense.  In 1853 [[John Ruskin]] asked his audience: "What do you at present ''mean'' by historical painting? Now-a-days it means the endeavour, by the power of imagination, to portray some historical event of past days."&lt;ref&gt;Lecture IV, p. 172, ''Lectures on Architecture and Painting: Delivered at Edinburgh, in November, 1853'', 1854, Wiley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qKsaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22historical+painting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lxuvUePlD4Pu0gXYk4CwBA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22historical%20painting%22&amp;f=false google books].&lt;/ref&gt;  So for example [[Harold Wethey]]'s three-volume catalogue of the paintings of [[Titian]] (Phaidon, 1969–75) is divided between "Religious Paintings", "Portraits", and "Mythological and Historical Paintings", though both volumes I and III cover what is included in the term "History Paintings".  This distinction is useful but is by no means generally observed, and the terms are still often used in a confusing manner. Because of the potential for confusion modern academic writing tends to avoid the phrase "historical painting", talking instead of "historical subject matter" in history painting, but where the phrase is still used in contemporary scholarship it will normally mean the painting of subjects from history, very often in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;As shown in the usages in Barlow, Strong, and Wright&lt;/ref&gt;  "Historical painting" may also be used, especially in discussion of painting techniques in conservation studies, to mean "old", as opposed to modern or recent painting.&lt;ref&gt;As in "The beautifully renovated Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam will open its doors to the public in 2013. To celebrate this event the Rijksmuseum will host a three-day symposium on Historical Painting Techniques. The central theme of the symposium will be the technical study of historically used painting techniques, the historical painting materials, their origin and trade, and their application in the painter’s workshop." [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques Rijksmuseum, "Painting Techniques - Call for Papers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531094855/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques |date=2013-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th-century British writing on art the terms "'''subject painting'''" or "anecdotic" painting were often used for works in a line of development going back to [[William Hogarth]] of monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative with unidentified characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela M. Fletcher|title=Narrating Modernity: The British Problem Picture, 1895-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvT_0aOkOSkC&amp;pg=PA146|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3568-0|page=146 note 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[William Holman Hunt]]'s 1853 painting ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' or [[Augustus Egg]]'s ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'', a set of three paintings, updating sets by Hogarth such as ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]''.

History painting was the dominant form of [[academic art|academic painting]] in the various national academies in the 18th century, and for most of the 19th, and  increasingly historical subjects dominated.  During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods the heroic treatment of contemporary history in a frankly propagandistic fashion by [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Carle Vernet]] and others was supported by the French state, but after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 the French governments were not regarded as suitable for heroic treatment and many artists retreated further into the past to find subjects, though in Britain depicting the victories of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] mostly occurred after they were over.  Another path was to choose contemporary subjects that were oppositional to government either at home and abroad, and many of what were arguably the last great generation of history paintings were protests at contemporary episodes of repression or outrages at home or abroad: [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' (1814), [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818–19), [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830).  These were heroic, but showed heroic suffering by ordinary civilians.

[[Romanticism|Romantic artists]] such as Géricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works. Others such as [[Jan Matejko]] in Poland, [[Vasily Surikov]] in Russia, [[José Moreno Carbonero]] in Spain and [[Paul Delaroche]] in France became specialized painters of large historical subjects.  The ''[[style troubadour]]'' ("[[troubadour]] style") was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; [[Ingres]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and  [[Henri Jean-Baptiste Victoire Fradelle|Henri Fradelle]] painted such works. Sir [[Roy Strong]] calls this type of work the "Intimate Romantic", and in French it was known as the "peinture de genre historique" or "peinture anecdotique" ("historical genre painting" or "anecdotal painting").&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 36-40; Wright, 269-273, French terms on p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Church commissions for large group scenes from the Bible had greatly reduced, and historical painting became very significant.  Especially in the early 19th century, much historical painting depicted specific moments from historical literature, with the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]] a particular favourite, in France and other European countries as much as Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, throughout; Strong, 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the century medieval scenes were expected to be very carefully researched, using the work of historians of costume, architecture and all elements of decor that were becoming available. And example of this is the extensive research of Byzantine architecture, clothing and decoration made in Parisian museums and libraries by [[José Moreno Carbonero|Moreno Carbonero]] for his masterwork ''The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artehistoria.com/es/obra/entrada-de-roger-de-flor-en-constantinopla|title=Entrada de Roger de Flor en Constantinopla {{!}} artehistoria.com|website=www.artehistoria.com|language=es|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The provision of examples and expertise for artists, as well as revivalist industrial designers, was one of the motivations for the establishment of museums like the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 24-26, 47-73; Wright, 269-273&lt;/ref&gt;  New techniques of [[printmaking]] such as the [[chromolithograph]] made good quality [[monochrome]] print reproductions both relatively cheap and very widely accessible, and also hugely profitable for artist and publisher, as the sales were so large.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical painting often had a close relationship with [[Nationalism]], and painters like Matejko in Poland could play an important role in fixing the prevailing historical narrative of national history in the popular mind.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 32-36&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' ("Fireman art") was a derisory term for official academic historical painting,&lt;ref&gt;Harding, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; and in a final phase, "History painting of a debased sort, scenes of brutality and terror, purporting to illustrate episodes from Roman and Moorish history, were Salon sensations.  On the overcrowded walls of the exhibition galleries, the paintings that shouted loudest got the attention".&lt;ref&gt;White, 91&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painting was an alternative genre that offered similar exotic costumes and decor, and at least as much opportunity to depict sex and violence.

The '''Hove amber cup''' is a [[Bronze Age]] cup that was discovered in a great [[round barrow]] mound which was crudely excavated in 1856, in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]], and is now in [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx The Hove amber cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027000939/http://brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx |date=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found during the construction of [[Palmeira Square]].  The barrow was of exceptional size and quality, suggesting a date in the mid-Bronze Age. The Hove amber cup is one of only two found in Britain; the other was in [[Dorset]]. However, the two are not of the same style of craftsmanship.

Dated to around 1250 BCE, the amber cup was found in a [[Wessex culture]] grave in a coffin made from a treetrunk. Also in the coffin were a skeleton, a Camerton (Wessex culture) type dagger, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a small axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=A. F.|title=European Societies in the Bronze Age|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521367295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbIVASSe9jcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Hove+amber+cup+dagger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yr7T4C5O6qx0AX1o72_Ag&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hove%20amber%20cup%20dagger&amp;f=false|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been associated with a small group of other "unstable" cups with round bottoms, made of precious materials and found in north-western Europe.  Most are in gold, but also silver, amber and [[shale]]. The [[Ringlemere Cup]] and [[Rillaton Cup]] are the two British gold cups.  The amber would have come from the [[Baltic region]], and the group suggest early trade links between Britain and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., full catalogue entry at pp. 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original account==
According to the original description by Barclay Philips, 
{{Quote|In the earth with which the coffin was filled were numerous small fragments of carious bone, apparently charred, some of which were picked out; and about the centre, as if, said one of the men, they had rested on the breast of the body interred, were found the following curious relics: —

An Amber Cup, hemispherical in shape, rather deep in proportion to its width, with a " lip " or " nick," and ornamented merely with a band of fine lines running round the outside, about half an inch from the top. There is one handle, large enough for the insertion of a finger, ornamented with a fillet on each side of the surface, which is flat, similar to that on the cup itself. From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band before mentioned not passing over the space within the handle, and its being marked off with a line at each end, seemingly cut across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by hand. There are two small chips in the rim.

That on the left of the handle is fresh, and was caused by the man who found the cup accidentally striking it, as he told me, with his spade, when he first came upon it ; that on the right is not so large, but is ancient, as is shown by its appearance. The cup is perfectly smooth inside and out, excepting where the earth in which it was buried still adheres to the surface ; but since its exhumation the amber has cracked slightly in every part. On the cup being lifted by the handle, this broke into two pieces, having received a blow from the workman's spade, but fortunately the fragments fit very exactly, and I have therefore easily repaired it.

The following are the dimensions of the cup, which I have carefully measured, expressed in inches and decimal parts: — &lt;br /&gt;
External diameter, 3.5 inches; internal, 3.35. &lt;br /&gt;
Height, 2.5 ; depth, 2.4. &lt;br /&gt;
Internal diameter at and below band, 3'; width of lip, '125. &lt;br /&gt;
Distance of band from upper rim of lip, .5; width of band of six fillets, .3. &lt;br /&gt;
Width of handle at upper and lower end, 1.5 in centre,"6. &lt;br /&gt;
Thickness of handle, '2; depth of handle from upper surface of insertion between lip and fillet to surface below, 1'4. &lt;br /&gt;
Projection of handle from surface of cup to outer surface of handle, .85; average thickness of cup, .2.

According to these measurements I find, by calculation, that the capacity of the cup is a little more than half a pint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philips|first=Barclay|title=Discovery of a Tumulus at Hove, near Brighton, Containing an Amber Cup, &amp;c|journal=Sussex Archaeological Collections|year=1857|volume=IX|pages=119–125|url=https://archive.org/details/sussexarchaeolog09suss}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

'''Leonard Digges''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|g|z}}; 1588 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1635) was an accomplished [[Hispanist]] and minor poet,&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Digges, Leonard (1588-1635)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Steinberg, "Digges, Leonard," in: ''Cassell's Encyclopedia of World Literature,'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; a younger son of the astronomer [[Thomas Digges]] (1545&amp;ndash;95, and younger brother of Sir [[Dudley Digges]] (1583&amp;ndash;1639). After his father's death in 1595, his mother married Thomas Russell of Alderminster,&lt;ref&gt;A village about four miles south of Stratford.&lt;/ref&gt; who was named by [[William Shakespeare]] as one of the two overseers of his will.  There are varying opinions about the extent to which the young Leonard Digges might have been influenced in his choice of profession by his stepfather's association with Shakespeare; disagreements about whether he was or was not personally acquainted with the playwright have in recent years eclipsed discussion of the work of Digges himself.

==Life==
Leonard Digges matriculated at [[University College, Oxford]] in 1603, the year of his mother's remarriage, and graduated BA in 1606.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  This was followed by a period of study abroad.  He may have traveled to Spain with fellow Hispanist [[James Mabbe]], whom he knew from Oxford, for he wrote a note on the flyleaf of a book which Mabbe sent from Madrid to Will Baker, also a friend from Oxford days.  The book was a copy of ''Rimas'' by [[Lope de Vega]] (published in 1613); it still survives, in the library of [[Balliol College]].  Digges's inscription reads:

::Will Baker: Knowinge
::that M&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; Mab: was to
::sende you this Booke
::of sonets, w&lt;sup&gt;ch&lt;/sup&gt; with Spaniards
::here is accounted of their
::lope de Vega as in Englande
::wee sholde of o&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;: Will
::Shakespeare. I colde not
::but insert thus much to
::you, that if you like
::him not, you muste neuer
::neuer reade Spanishe Poet
:::::Leo:Digges&lt;ref&gt;Paul Morgan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ws1SAlRJ-Y8C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "'Our Will Shakespeare' and Lope de Vega: An Unrecorded Contemporary Document,"] in Allardyce Nicoll (ed.),''Shakespeare Survey,'' 16,Cambridge University Press, 2002 reprint, pp.118-120: Samuel Schoenbaum, ''William Shakespeare: a compact documentary life,'' ibid.p.313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony a Wood]] said of Leonard Digges that he "was esteemed by those who knew him in Univ.coll. a great master of the English language, a perfect understander of the French and Spanish, a good poet, and no mean orator."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Anthony, [https://archive.org/stream/athenaeoxoniense02wooduoft/athenaeoxoniense02wooduoft_djvu.txt ''Athenae Oxonienses: an Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in the University of Oxford from 1500 to 1690''], published in London in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood says also that "upon his supplication made to the venerable convocation" of University College Oxford, Digges was made M.A. in 1626, "in consideration that he had spent many years in good letters in transmarine universities."  He lived in the College from then until his death in 1635, and was buried in the College chapel (no longer standing).

==Works==
Digges translated [[Claudian]]'s ''The Rape of Proserpine'' (printed [[1617 in literature|1617]]). His translation of ''Varia fortuna de soldado Píndaro'' by [[Gonzalo de Céspedes y Meneses]], was published in [[1622 in literature|1622]] as  ''Gerardo, the Unfortunate Spaniard'', and was used by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] as a source for his plays ''[[The Spanish Curate]]'' and ''[[The Maid in the Mill]]''.

Digges's publisher was [[Edward Blount]], a close friend of Mabbe's and one of the syndicate which published Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] in 1623.  Digges and Mabbe both contributed prefatory poems to the Folio, as did [[Ben Jonson]]—also published by Blount.  The previous year, Digges and Jonson had both contributed [[commendatory verse]]s to a work translated by Mabbe and published by Blount.&lt;ref name=Freehafer&gt;Freehafer, John, "Leonard Digges, Ben Johnson, and the Beginning of Shakespeare Idolatry", ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Winter, 1970), pp. 63-75&lt;/ref&gt; Commendatory verses by Digges were also included in an edition of Shakespeare's ''Poems'', published by [[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] in 1640, five years after Digges had died.  Freehafer suggests that since these verses refer to Shakespeare's plays rather than to his poems, they may have been intended for the Second Folio.&lt;ref name=Freehafer/&gt;

'''Martin Stone''' (11 December 1946, [[Woking]], [[Surrey]] –  9 November 2016, [[Versailles]], France)&lt;ref name =Tele&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/11/29/martin-stone-guitarist-rare-book-dealer-obituary/ |title=Martin Stone, guitarist and rare book dealer – obituary |work=Daily Telegraph |date=2016-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[guitarist]] and rare book dealer. He was a longtime resident of [[Fingest]] in Buckinghamshire and, latterly, Paris.

==Musical career==
Stone was a few years younger than his later musical partner [[Michael Moorcock]] but grew up in the same part of South London, knew the same book- and music-shops and had the same enthusiasms. Educated at Whitgift Grammar, he initially wanted to be a journalist and began as a cub reporter on ''[[The Croydon Advertiser]]'', interviewing [[Jimmy Page]] when he was still a session musician. Stone's passion for the guitar led him to become a musician.

Stone played in many groups, including Junior's Blues Band, Stone's Masonry, Almost Presley, [[The Action]], [[Savoy Brown|Savoy Brown Blues Band]], [[Mighty Baby]], [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]], Les Soucoupes violentes, Southern Comfort, [[Pink Fairies]], [[The 101ers]], [[Wreckless Eric]], and the Gibson Girls.&lt;ref name =Tele/&gt; Martin also played live with French chanteuse [[Anne Pigalle]] for a couple of years including Glastonbury in 2005 for a second time  

He continued to play, backing [[Marianne Faithfull]] in her live performances, lead guitar in the French band Almost Presley and others.&lt;ref name =Tele/&gt;

He was given consideration as a possible replacement for Brian Jones in the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Daily Telegraph obituary|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=29 November 2016|pages=obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book runner==
By the 1980s Stone was earning much of his living as a bookseller, with an almost uncanny knack for finding 'lost' or famous books. He was a great fan of the writer [[M. P. Shiel]], who first inspired his passion for book collecting and later book-selling, achieving an international reputation as a bookrunner.&lt;ref name =Tele/&gt; He was a major player in [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]]'s memoir ''A Pound of Paper: Confessions of a Book Addict''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Pound of Paper Confessions of a Book Addict |last=Baxter |first=John |authorlink=John Baxter (author)|year=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin/Thomas Dunne Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-312-31726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the subject of a limited edition photographic book ''Martin Stone, Bookscout'' by the California rare bookseller Peter Howard of Serendipity Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4520968 |title=Martin Stone, Bookscout : twenty-two photographs by Steven J. Gelberg with an essay by Peter B. Howard. |accessdate=2009-11-21 |work=SU LAIR |publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  appeared in the television documentary ''Without Walls: The Cardinal And The Corpse'' ([[Iain Sinclair]] / [[Chris Petit]] 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/481345 |title=WITHOUT WALLS: The CARDINAL AND THE CORPSE |accessdate=2009-11-21 |work=Film &amp; TV Database |publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known to be the basis for the character Nicholas Lane in Sinclair's novel ''White Chappell, Scarlett Tracings'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cunningham, David ''White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings''| publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia| date=21 March 2002| url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=8768| accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giotto di Bondone - Navicella - WGA09363.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1628 full-size copy in oil in the Vatican]]
[[File:Parri spinelli, copia della navicella di giotto, metropolitan museum.jpg|thumb|300px|Drawing of the lost mosaic by [[Parri Spinelli]], about 1420, once owned by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/90005191 Parri Spinelli, "Free Copy of Giotto's Navicella"], Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Navicella''''' (literally "little ship") of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, was a large and famous [[mosaic]] by [[Giotto di Bondone]] that occupied a large part of the wall above the entrance arcade, facing the main facade of the basilica across the courtyard. It depicted the version from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (Matthew 14:24–32) of [[Jesus' walk on water|Christ walking on the water]], the only one of the three gospel accounts where [[Saint Peter]] is summoned to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of the miracle appear in three Gospels: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:22–33]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:45|Mark 6:45–52]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:16|John 6:16–21]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost entirely destroyed during the construction of the new [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the 17th century, but fragments were preserved from the sides of the composition, and what is effectively a new work, incorporating some original fragments, was restored to a position at the centre of the portico of the new building in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;"St Peter's"; Lubbock, 158; Tomei, 31; Nicholls, 162; [http://www.bridgemanart.com/asset/279736/Giotto-di-Bondone-c.1266-1337-after/The-Navicella-of-St.-Peter-mosaic-bw-photo?search_context={%22url%22%3A%22\%2Fsearch\%2Flocation\%2FSt.-Peter%27s-Vatican-City\%2F3734%22%2C%22num_results%22%3A17%2C%22search_type%22%3A%22location_assets%22%2C%22sort_order%22%3A%22asset_id%22%2C%22location_id%22%3A%223734%22%2C%22item_index%22%3A16} Present image], from Bridgeman Art Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic, designed to be seen from a distance, was extremely large. A full-scale copy in oil, commissioned by the Vatican from [[Francesco Berretta]] in 1628, after much of the work had already been lost round the edges, measures {{convert|7.4|x|9.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/html/g/giotto/zz_misc/y_mosaic/11navice.html WGA]&lt;/ref&gt; The full mosaic was probably about {{convert|9.4|x|13|m|ft}}, with an inscription in Latin verse running below the image.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The mosaic was commissioned in 1298 by [[Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi]], canon of St. Peter's, whose [[donor portrait]] was to the right of Christ's feet.&lt;ref&gt;Hösl, Ignaz, "Kardinal Jacobus Gaietani Stefaneschi: Ein Beitrag zur Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte des beginnenden vierzehnten Jahrhunderts," Berlin, 1908. &lt;/ref&gt; Giotto's mosaic therefore belonged to the preparations of St. Peters for the [[holy year]] in 1300. The date of the commission is attested by a document copied in the 17th century. There are no indications of a later dating, nor are there indications that Giotto's mosaic replaced an older one. &lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Stefaneschi's obituary of 1347, the work cost 2,200 [[florin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to an official document from 1298,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; references to the work as by Giotto are found in a Vatican [[necrology]] entry for Cardinal Stefaneschi recording his death in 1343, and then the Latin chronicle of Giotto's home city [[Florence]] written in the late 14th century by [[Filippo Villani]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rectangular, and positioned so that those leaving the basilica saw it across the courtyard outside the church, and passed under it if they left by the main route.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; [http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lookandlearn-preview/M/M098/M098735.jpg Later print of the original location]&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure of a man fishing on the shore to the left was thought to be a self-portrait of Giotto, as [[Vasari]]'s ''Life'' records.  The composition was dominated by the fishing boat with its large sail, which represented a metaphor of the "Ship of the Church", whose "captain" on earth was Saint Peter and his successors as [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;St Peter's&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned at a very difficult time for the Papacy, who were unable even to control the gangsterish nobility of Rome, and had therefore left the city, but the image promised that both church and Papacy were, with the help of Christ, "unsinkable".&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 36; Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the eleven figures still in the boat, it has been suggested that the one holding the [[tiller]] is (anachronistically in terms of the Gospels) [[Saint Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 164, reporting Köhren-Jansen, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In the sky, two almost naked classical style "wind god" figures blow through horns or funnels, one from each side, below pairs of haloed male figures.&lt;!-- who? anyone? The 4 Evangelists? --&gt;  Giotto would have produced drawings for specialist mosaic workers to recreate on the wall; whether he had any further involvement as the work was created is unknown.

The subject is depicted elsewhere in [[medieval art]] of the period, and later works like [[fresco]]s in the "Spanish Chapel" of [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella#Spanish Chapel|Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, and in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] by [[Masaccio]] (or perhaps his colleague [[Masolino]]), and one of the [[bronze]] relief panels on [[Ghiberti]]'s north doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on Papal coins and medals, though usually with Peter in the boat, often as the only figure.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 163; [http://www.coinarchives.com/w/results.php?search=Navicella&amp;s=0&amp;results=100 Examples from www.coinarchives.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the only modern (post-classical) work described in [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s ''[[De Pictura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 199; Lubbock, 158&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a large depiction of a maritime scene was unprecedented in [[marine art]], at least since classical times.

The arcade across the courtyard and its mosaic was at first unaffected by the protracted and complicated rebuilding of the main basilica, but in the 17th century the mosaic underwent a complicated series of four moves and restorations or remodellings in 1610, 1618, 1629 and 1674/75 which finally took it to its present size, condition and location above the main door inside the portico of the new church.&lt;ref&gt;See Kleinhenz 749, Capresi 36, Tomei, 31, though none give a coherent account of the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Only two bust-length figures of angels in [[roundel]]s survive from the original;&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 31;  Moioli et al., 244&lt;/ref&gt; one remains in the Vatican, while the other was given to the church of San Pietro Ispano in [[Boville Ernica]] in 1610, when the mosaic was first removed from its original place. The former is considerably restored (in 1924, 1950 and 1975–80), and was discovered underneath later work in 1911 (or 1924). The Boville Ernica fragment consisted of little original substance and was completely restored between 1888 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Werke (Giottus Pictor II) Wien: Böhlau, 2008, Pg. 262-263.
[[File:Bilder-50617-15704-original.tif|thumb|Fragment in Boville Ernica, before restoration.]]
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite none of the copies of the original including these figures it is thought they were part of the original, probably in a border.&lt;ref&gt;Papacy, 6–7; Tomei, 31; Moioli et al., who give the date of discovery of the Vatican fragment as 1924, and the dates of subsequent work&lt;/ref&gt;  There are thought to be some patches of original work remaining in the mosaic still in St Peter's, which is now semi-circular with a straight bottom edge to fit into a [[lunette]]. Areas where original work seems to survive are in "the gilded edge of the ship, the sail blown by the wind, various sections of some apostles".&lt;ref&gt;Vatican&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The style of the work can now only be judged from the two angel fragments, restored as they are. Vasari's description emphasized the varied reactions of the figures in the boat as they saw Peter sinking below the waves, and the patient expression on the face of the fisherman on the shore, who, like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ploughman in ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' seems to ignore the dramatic scene on the water in concentrating on his own task.  But, as [[Svetlana Alpers]] has shown, these were the terms in which Vasari tended to describe large [[history painting]]s he admired, though [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s description in ''[[De pictura]]'' also "treats ...[the work] as a psychological narrative".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 190–192, 199 (quoted); Lubbock, 158 quotes from Alberti&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars, working from the fragments, emphasize the influence of the major Roman artist of the day, [[Pietro Cavallini]], who was also patronized by Cardinal Stefanesci, and of the Late Antique and Early Medieval works to be seen in Rome.  According to [[John White (art historian)|John White]]: "The relatively schematic, linear quality of much late-thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century work is wholly absent.  The impressionistic technique and range of colour both derive from the fifth century. It is impossible to say how much this technique reflects the ideas of Giotto himself and how much those of the skilled mosaicists working under him. The two heads are, however, closely related both to the work of Cavallini, whose art still dominated the Roman scene, and to the basic type of physiognomy developed on the walls of the [[Arena Chapel]]."&lt;ref&gt;White, 332 (quoted); see also Calvesi, 40, and Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
There are a number of records of the original design in drawings and prints—at least 17 are recorded.  The earliest are a number of drawings attributed to the Florentine artist [[Parri Spinelli]] (c. 1387–1453), of which the most detailed is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and others are in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Bayonne]]. However, the variations between these, and other drawings by Spinelli of surviving works, show that he was in the habit of making rather loose interpretations of works that he recorded in drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, no. 2 (New York); Dunbar, 104–110 (Cleveland)&lt;/ref&gt; Most later copies date from after parts of the mosaic were already lost, and none form a complete record of the full design. Some prints, like an [[engraving]] by [[Nicolas Beatrizet]] of about 1559, are reversed (mirror-image) copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/24364447@N05/6559941119/ image on flickr] of the Beatrizet; [http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ Unreversed print of 1567] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130702063243/http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ |date=2013-07-02 }}, by Mario Labacco, from Budapest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel account==
Only in the account in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:24–33]] does Peter also leave the boat to walk on the waves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vision of St Catherine of Siena==
On the evening of January 29, 1380, at the time of [[Vespers]], Saint [[Catherine of Siena]], who had been contemplating the mosaic for some hours, suddenly felt as if "the ship had fallen off and landed on her shoulders" with "unbearable weight".  She apparently never walked again, and died three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Papetros, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lassie Punch 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Whitman punch out book from the 1950s based upon a television show]]

A '''punch out book''' (also known as press out book or push out book) is a large toy book printed on stiff card or [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] usually comprising several pages of perforated, colorfully printed figures or shapes. The figures can be gently "punched" from the pages with the fingers and then assembled into various objects. Punch out books generally do not require scissors, tape, fasteners, or glue for the assembly of the contents. Most punch out books are centered on a single theme like a [[fairy tale]], holiday, television program, or movie. The books first appeared on the market in the 1930s and gained in popularity through the mid-century. [[Whitman Publishing]] of [[Racine, Wisconsin]], was one of the most prolific publishers of punch out books. Vintage punch out books with radio, television or movie themes are sought by collectors and command high prices.

'''''Red Dust''''' is a 2000 novel written by South African-born [[Gillian Slovo]] that is structured around the hearings of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) in the fictional town Smitsrivier and also addresses the question of truth.

In post-[[apartheid]] South Africa, retired anti-apartheid activist and lawyer Ben Hoffman cannot turn down James Sizela's wish to use the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearing of local ex-police officer Dirk Hendricks to find out what happened to James's son Steve who has been missing since the mid-1980s confrontation between white state authorities and the black [[African National Congress]] (ANC). But Ben knows he cannot accept this case alone as he is ill and his powers are waning. He calls his former student, New York prosecutor Sarah Barcant to return to South Africa to help him with the amnesty hearing.
They hope that the questioning of MP Alex Mpondo, a torture victim of Dirk and comrade of Steve, in connection with the TRC's full disclosure law will enable them to get hold of Pieter Muller, Smitsrivier's former police boss, whom they think killed Steve Sizela. Intended to reconcile South Africans with the violent chapter of their country's past the hearings turn out to open up old and create new wounds making the characters face the truth or their ideas of it.

==Biographical context==
Gillian Slovo's interest in the TRC derives from her family background that is deeply rooted in the struggle against apartheid. In fact, her parents are the only whites buried in [[Soweto]]'s [[Avalon Cemetery]].

Her father, [[Joe Slovo]], led the [[South African Communist Party]] and was also a leading figure of the African National Congress. He is also one of the leaders of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the military wing of the ANC, founded in the early 1960s. Joe Slovo returned to South Africa in 1990 to take part in the negotiations between ANC and the white government about a peaceful transition towards democracy. He later served as Minister for Housing under Nelson Mandela until his death in 1995.

[[Ruth First]], Gillian's mother, was a determined activist as well. She worked, after having to flee South Africa in 1964, at various English universities before returning to the continent in 1978 to continue her struggle at the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo, Mozambique. On 17 August 1982, she was murdered by a parcel bomb sent by the South African Security Force.

She acknowledges that ''Red Dust'' is a direct result of her mother's death. She wrote, "The seeds of it were born out of my grave-side realisation that if the country would not leave me alone, then I would have to face it".&lt;ref name=writer&gt;{{cite web |title= Gillian Slovo, Biography |publisher= British Council, Contemporary Writers |url= http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth235 |accessdate= 2008-01-29 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091903/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth235 |archivedate= 3 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Slovo experienced the workings of the TRC herself when she faced the murderer of her mother, [[Craig Williamson]], in amnesty hearings in South Africa. She described the trial as extremely painful, especially given the result that Williamson received amnesty. &lt;!----[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2000/06/02/southafrica/AMNESTY.HTM] this link no longer works---&gt; Yet, she understood the way they (the Security Police) thought and used her personal experiences of unwanted intimacy in ''Red Dust''. Her attitude towards the TRC is reflected in her assumption that "It helps a whole society reconcile itself to its past, without ignoring or denying it."&lt;ref name= new&gt;{{cite web |title= Revealing is Healing |publisher= The Humanist |url= http://newhumanist.org.uk/585 |accessdate= 2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Slovo said:

{{quote|We don't dictate all the experiences we are going to endure, the difficult experiences we're going to endure in life, and we do the best we can through them … but I think in the long term, I think in the long term it was a kind of settling kind of experience.

Because I think in the long term I think it is true, the truth does settle you, there's this slogan the Truth Commission has, it's 'the truth will set you free', and I'm very opposed to slogans, you know, they're everything that I as a writer don't believe in. I think you've got to go for complexity rather than simplicity, and to my great surprise, the truth did set me free.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web |title= Film: Red Dust, interview by Peter Thompson |date= November 13, 2005 |publisher= NineMSN |url= http://sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/film_reviews/article_1914.asp?s=1 |accessdate= 2008-01-29 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724183821/http://sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/film_reviews/article_1914.asp?s=1 |archivedate= 24 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Characterizations==
{{Tone|date=December 2009}}
'''Alex Mpondo'''	
		
ANC- activist Alex Mpondo comes back to Smitsrivier, the city he grew up in, to face his former torturer Dirk Hendricks in order to help the Sizela family to find their murdered son Steve, Mpondo's friend as well as comrade in the struggle.
	 	
Alex Mpondo was tortured for supplying the ANC with weaponry for the fight against the apartheid regime. He was caught and arrested along with Steve Sizela who he saw the last time being carried out of the prison almost dead. This caused an inner conflict about his responsibility of Steve's death because he isn't sure whether he broke in his interrogation and betrayed him by revealing his identity or not. To escape this struggle he left the town in 1985 and now is a Member of Parliament.
	 	
Returning home people portray him as a "charismatic" "ladies man". Sarah Barcant, his lawyer in his amnesty hearing, notices first his strong hands, the blue Jeans and the white T-shirt that hung beautifully from his boxer's shoulders. For her he has "so much of the city about him". The image of the successful MP turns out to be only a facade he puts up to protect himself from his guilty conscience. All this time he has dealt with the problem by repressing his past. He tries to "put Steve out of his mind [and] buried him as surely as Steve himself has been buried". But the question, if he sealed his friend's fate, is still dominating his life: "Steve's death: his fault?" 
	 	
Alex comes only back on James Sizela's request, who holds him accountable for his son's passing away. "It is all for James's sake, (…), not for his own".
	 	
Alex himself is scared to oppose Dirk Hendricks, because his past is going to be excavated. In the beginning of the hearings he tries to keep up his barrier to prevent Dirk Hendricks's narrative, his version of history, becoming his own. Sometimes, when his past gets a grip on him, he is unpredictable and shows hidden facets of his personality, like a "chameleon".
	 	
But the urge to know the answer to his question drives him to keep cross-examining Dirk Hendricks, although he in many situations reaches the point, where he simply wants to quit. He can't stand the intimacy between his torturer and himself, knowing that "he'll turn the screws on him". Alex is ashamed of the fact that he might have broken by telling the place of the weapon storage and also anxious that by revealing this in court he could also lose his reputation of a hero. In his opinion Dirk has turned him white: "He was no longer black".
	 	
In the end Alex Mpondo still doesn't know the truth, but yet he has gained a lot from facing Dirk Hendricks. By talking and reliving the events once more, he is now able to find a way to handle his emotions and to close with the past. He developed a working relationship to his lawyer Sarah Barcant, who forced him to continue the hearings. This climaxes in a love scene, which also is the last one since both of them prefer to continue their individual paths in life.

'''Dirk Hendricks'''

Dirk Hendricks is one of the main  characters in ''Red Dust''.
He is imprisoned for some other crime he committed during the time of apartheid. He is scared of being imprisoned once again, so he applies for amnesty.
"…and Dirk a jailbird…that he looked like shit."
These were Pieter Muller's first thoughts when he saw Dirk after coming out of the van.
Because of his time in prison he lost nearly everything, including his family and his job. He suffers from PTSD and has lost his bearings in the new South Africa. Only his friendship to Pieter  still remains.
His last chance to finally obtain freedom is to apply for amnesty in front of the TRC. In fact Pieter Muller is guilty of murder. Dirk now is indecisive whether to stay loyal to Pieter or to tell the whole truth.
From his point of view he didn't do anything criminal, he was ordered to do so in that special time of riot and trouble. He only did his duty. He was a patriot and believed in fighting for the right cause. His true self is only revealed to Alex. A main part of the story hinges on their intimate relationship of torturer and victim.

'''Sarah Barcant'''

Sarah Barcant, a 36 years old lawyer from New York, a typical career woman, well-dressed with fashionable clothes and "high-heels", comes back to her past.
She is living in New York but was born in Smitsrivier, where she grew up and lived with her parents in the Main Street. Her father was an optician, but nevertheless he "had not made enough money to move his family of Main Street to Francis Avenue, which was home to most of Smitsrivier white population" (p.&amp;nbsp;33).
She got the chance to study law and to move to New York with the help of Ben Hoffmann, her mentor. There she started a new life. After the end of apartheid her parents moved to Perth, Australia. Fourteen years later she now gets a telephone call from Ben, who needs her help for a new case in South Africa.
Back in Smitsrivier she remembers her past and childhood. Everything has changed, but it is her who has changed most. She feels a bond to South Africa but doesn't belong there anymore.
She is only focused on the case and not on the people around her and especially her client Alex Mpondo. Sarah is doing her job very accurately, "It's called preparation. I was taught to do it properly". She loves her job and shows good skills as a lawyer. One example is the hearing of Dirk Hendricks, where she puts him under pressure. Ben Hoffmann, however sees her different behaviour: "You are no longer the person I knew or the lawyer I trained. You think like a prosecutor. Is that what New York has done to you? Did it turn you into such an unfeeling monster?".
At first she just wants to find out the truth and does not really care about the individual emotions and trauma involved, but just wants to do a good job. In the end she has changed. When she lies to Alex about his share in Steve's death she bends the truth to help him.
One important relationship is the one to Ben Hoffman, her mentor. They met when he was middle-aged and she was fourteen. Ben changed her life because he taught her and then gave her the possibility to go to New York as a lawyer. He helped her in every situation, "he had shared his life with her, outside of his work". Sarah was always like a daughter to him. He still wants her to stay permanently: "Without Smitsrivier, without South Africa, you will always be less than you could ever have been."

'''Pieter Muller'''

Pieter Muller is the second character that is portrayed in the book. When the reader first encounters him, he is in his bedroom and wakes up because he thinks he heard something. He then goes outside with his dogs to check if everything is all right. When he finds nothing, he begins to puzzle about why he woke up and figures out that it must have been because of the TRC and James Sizela.
Pieter is described as a thickset man with a big square face with narrow eyes, and heavy jowls resting on a bullish neck. He has downy ginger hair and a fading ginger beard. He has an air of authority over him and 'always moves with purpose'. He makes a living as the boss of a small security company in Smitsrivier.
In the past Pieter worked as a police officer. There he interrogated Steve Sizela and tortured him for over a month until he died after he and Dirk put a wager on who would break his suspect first. He doesn't think that his actions were wrong. He says: "Steve's death was an oversight. [...] It was my hand that knocked his head against the wall, that knocked his brains out." This also shows how little remorse he shows for what he did. In the past he must have had a bad conscience though, because he makes Dirk bury the body while getting away with some weak excuse - he had to go to church - which also was his "death sentence". He tries to actively ignore the past - which makes him seem very stubborn and ignorant.
Pieter cares deeply for his wife Mary, who is sick and needs help to get around the house and he is always looking after her. He sometimes still longs for how she used to be ("...but no, that version of his wife existed only in the past..." ). Another side of Pieter is that of  a cold manipulator; he tries to influence Dirk Hendricks to not reveal any critical information. He also manipulates James Sizela to shoot him in the end of the book. He does this so that he doesn't have to go to the TRC and apply for amnesty, because it would be against his ideals, he would rather die than admit that he was wrong and beg for mercy. He also wants to cash in his insurance to make sure that his wife gets the support she needs.

'''James Sizela'''

"Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree." How does this quote relate to the character of James Sizela?
James Sizela is an African, grey-haired old man with cinnamon bark skin, high cheek bones, a high forehead and gently slanting eyes.
As headmaster of the local school he wears an old-fashioned pinstripe suit, which fits his general behaviour as he is stern and unmoving. He sees himself as a man of the old school and follows the principles of probity, morality and integrity. He teaches those principles at school and also raised his son, Steve, in that manner.
Even though he wants to bury his long dead and missing son he does not really do a lot to support Sarah Barcant, who fights in court to find the body. James even gets angry when she wants to talk to him during class while he should be teaching. This is one example for his attitude towards work and duty, which is one of his higher priorities. He even misses the amnesty hearing of his son's murderer to go to work. This makes him look uninterested and not caring. In general he is quiet and it seems James doesn't allow emotions at all, and doesn't comfort his wife after Steve's remains are recovered. The latter shows that James Sizela has a problem with bonding and relationships which Pieter Muller proves when he talks to James about Steve.
This is one of the moments James shows the one emotion he knows: anger. In fact he gets angry enough, when Pieter Muller tells him he is responsible for his son's death, to lose control and to kill Pieter, even though he is not himself at that moment, in doing so, he commits "Perjury of the highest degree" to his principles of probity, morality and integrity.
As Muller's wife wrongly insists on her husband having killed himself she further denies James to deal with his action. He resigns from his teaching position.
The character James Sizela is quite important to interpret Red Dust, because he shows that everybody can become a killer given the "right" circumstances.

'''Ben Hoffmann'''

"He looks […] frail like a broken doll." Ben Hoffmann is an ageing white lawyer who has already retired and who has spent all his skill and expertise into representing black people in court, even in the time of apartheid.
He lives with his wife Anna in their house in town. They have a strict daily routine, treating each other with lots of respect. "In the fifty years they'd shared a bed, he'd never taken more than half unless invited to".
They don't have any children, but Sarah Barcant, Ben's former student, more or less takes a daughter-role for Ben.
Ben still treats Sarah like his student instead of as a grown-up who already worked as a prosecutor in New York for several years.
He is a stubborn person, who refuses to give up his professional principles as a lawyer, even though he is severely ill. "I'm dying"
"It had nevertheless been a life well lived. A good life, a rewarding life.[…] He had promised himself[…] to live out what remained to him in peace with his Anna".

Ben Hoffman's function in "Red Dust" is to establish the link between the Sizelas and Sarah Barcant. Without him she would never have returned to her homeland South Africa. Also, he serves as the advocate of the moral justification of the TRC in the debates he has with Sarah.

==Structure==
The novel is told from multiple perspectives using 3rd person selective omniscience. Thus Slovo adds heavily to the message by making the reader see through the eyes of all the characters in this network of truths and lies. Nobody is capable of establishing the truth.
Appropriately Slovo cites [[Shakespeare]] before she starts her story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:::Is not the truth
::::: the truth?
:::[[Henry IV, Part I]], Act 2 Scene 4&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biography==
Johnson began his musical career playing in folk clubs in the 1970s and ran a folk club at the [[University of Sussex]],&lt;ref name="AMG" /&gt; before forming a band called Grubstreet,&lt;ref name="IWW" /&gt; which split up in 1983.  Two years later he made his first solo album, ''In Amongst the Rain'', setting up his own label on which to release it, before forming an [[agitprop]] group, The Ministry of Humour, with Mark Shilcock and Graham Barnes.&lt;ref name="FWDE" /&gt;  After the break-up of this act and a failed attempt at forming a new electric band,&lt;ref name="AMG" /&gt; he returned to performing solo and also formed a duo with female singer Pip Collings.&lt;ref name="IWW" /&gt;

In 1997 he composed the song cycle ''Gentle Men'', based on the experiences of his grandfathers in the [[First World War]].  The song cycle was recorded by Johnson in collaboration with [[Roy Bailey (folk singer)|Roy Bailey]],&lt;ref name="IW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Broughton |first=Simon|author2=Mark Ellingham |author3=Richard Trillo  |title=World Music: The Rough Guide|isbn=1-85828-635-2 |year=1999 |publisher=Rough Guides |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed at the commemorative [[Passendale|Passchendaele]] Peace Concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/inart403.htm|title=Roy Bailey|publisher=The Living Tradition|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he was a special guest at the [[BBC]]'s "Folk Britannia" concert at the [[Barbican Centre]], ending the night with a rendition of World War I song "[[Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/features/folk-concert1.shtml|title=Folk Britannia|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916133143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/features/folk-concert1.shtml|archivedate=16 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains active and has released at least one album annually for over 20 years, as well as playing regular gigs, including benefits and political events.&lt;ref name="AMG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

[[Image:Rubinsteins.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nikolai (left) and Anton Rubinstein.]]
The '''Russian Musical Society''' (RMS) ({{lang-ru|Русское музыкальное общество}}) was an organization founded in 1859 by the [[Princess Charlotte of Württemberg|Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna]] (a German-born aunt of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]) and her protégé, pianist and composer [[Anton Rubinstein]], with the intent of raising the standard of music in the country and disseminating musical education.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John, ''Tchaikovsky'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973), 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubinstein and the Grand Duchess's travels together in Europe a decade earlier had prompted them to set up a permanent society to encourage both the study and performance of music in Russia.  The Grand Duchess was the provider and driving force for the RMS, successfully obtaining her nephew's Imperial approval.&lt;ref&gt;Struttle, Wilson, ''Tchaikovsky, His Music and Times'' (Speldhurst, Kent, United Kingdom: Midas Books, 1979), 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Rubinstein provided the musical leadership.  His presence lent the RMS a further appearance of prestige, given both his international career as a pianist and his reputation as a composer of distinction—qualities uncommon at that time for any native-born musician in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David, ''Tchaikovsky: The Early Years, 1840-1874'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1978), 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

The RMS's inaugural concert was given in November 1859, with Rubinstein playing one of his [[piano concerto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 60&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1860s, concerts given by the RMS had introduced the general public to all the [[symphony|symphonies]], [[piano concerto]]s and [[overture]]s of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Audiences had also heard [[oratorio]]s by [[George Frideric Handel]], [[cantata]]s by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[opera]]s by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], as well as works by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Russian music had also been performed.  [[Opera]]s by Russian composers which were presented included those of [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] and [[Anton Rubinstein]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, Alexander, ''Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man'' (New York: Schirmer Books, 1991), p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StPeterburgRMSQuartet.Auer.Pickel.Weickmann.Verzhbilovich.jpg|thumb|250px|The String Quartet of the Russian Musical Society of Saint Petersburg in the 1880s; (left to right) [[Leopold Auer]], Johann Wilhelm Zacharias Pickel, [[Hieronymus Weickmann]], [[Aleksandr Verzhbilovich]]]]
Most important, however, were the music classes offered by the RMS, open to all students, which eventually gave rise to professorial education.&lt;ref name="Poznansky, 62"&gt;Poznansky, 62&lt;/ref&gt; These classes were held at the Grand Duchess's home, the [[New Michael Palace|Mikhailovsky Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 60; Strutte, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the inception of the RMS, there had been no music school in Russia to provide a basic professional training in music.  Music instruction had been limited to the homes of the aristocracy and private schools.  Consequently, native Russian musicians and performers were rare.  Classical concerts were performed generally by foreign musicians, primarily from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 60; Poznansky, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the classes of the RMS, the [[Free Music School]], which emphasised [[choir|choral singing]], was also formed.  Both the classes and the school quickly became popular.  As surprising as the number of students who enrolled was their extreme diversity.  Bureaucrats, merchants, tradesmen and university students attended, as well as many young women who lacked the means to study privately.&lt;ref name="Poznansky, 62"/&gt;

In 1860, helped and encouraged by his brother Anton, [[Nikolai Rubinstein]] and Prince [[Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy]] founded a [[Moscow]] branch of the RMS in Rubinstein's own house.  This branch proved so successful that they eventually relocated it into larger quarters and expanded their work there.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, 42&lt;/ref&gt; Troubetzkoy was the chairman of RMS for seventeen years.

The RMS's formal successors were the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St. Petersburg Conservatory]], which opened (also under the auspices of Anton Rubinstein), in September 1862, and the [[Moscow Conservatory]], founded by Nikolai Rubinstein and Prince [[Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy]] in September 1866.

Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the RMS was disbanded in the same year.

The All-Russian Musical Society, which was established in 1987 is meant to be the legal successor of the Russian Musical Society traditions and cultural legacy. On February 18 of 2010 upon the decision of the All-Russian Music Society Fifth convention the society was renamed back to the original title of the Russian Music Society, which marked the official reincarnation of the pristine organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Устав Всероссийского музыкального общества. Принят Первым съездом ВМО 21 марта 1991 года.|last=|first=|publisher=Типография ВМО|year=1991|isbn=|location=Москва|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern RMS is the public agency with functions of the creative union. It consolidates thousands of people that represent musical and choreographic [[Russian culture|culture of Russia]] and its nations on both professional and amateur levels. The Society has chapters in all [[Russian regions]], which allows it to effectively influence the condition and development of the modern musical and choreographic art in the country, as well to track and analyze cultural trends.

Among major forms of the RMS involvement and its regional branches are organization of concerts, folklore holidays, master classes, music festivals and competitions. The RMS also assists Russian soloists and music groups in participation at the International festivals, competitions and concert tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmo.tvercult.ru/008.htm|title=Региональное музыкальное общество Тверской области|website=tmo.tvercult.ru|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore''' ({{IPA-it|ˈsanta maˈriːa madˈdʒoːre}}; ''''Basilica of Saint Mary Major'''', {{lang-la|Basilica Sanctae Mariae Maioris}}),&lt;ref&gt;The actual, official name seems to vary: the [[Holy See]]'s press office uses "Papal Liberian Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome" in English [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_law_bf_en.html in a 2011 note] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303044547/http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_law_bf_en.html |date=3 March 2013 }}, while the [http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/vita_liturgica/informazioni.htm official Vatican site for the Basilica] uses various formulas not including "Liberian" or ''Liberiana'', some under a coat of arms that includes "basilica Liberiana" in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt; or church of '''Santa Maria Maggiore''', is a [[Major basilica#Papal Basilicas|Papal]] [[major basilica]] and the largest [[Roman Catholic Marian church|Catholic Marian church]] in Rome, Italy, from which size it receives the appellation "major". 

The basilica enshrines the venerated image of [[Salus Populi Romani]], depicting the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the help and protectress of the Roman people, which was granted a [[Canonical coronation]] by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on 15 August 1838 accompanied by his [[Papal bull]] ''Cælestis Regina''.

Pursuant to the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 between the [[Holy See]] and Italy, the Basilica is within Italian territory and not the territory of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]].&lt;ref&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Holy See]] fully owns the Basilica, and Italy is legally obligated to recognize its full ownership thereof&lt;ref&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 13 ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; and to concede to it "the immunity granted by International Law to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign States."&lt;ref&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appellations==
The Basilica is sometimes referred to as [[Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary Major|Our Lady of the Snows]], a name given to it in the [[Roman Missal]] from 1568 to 1969 in connection with the [[Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary Major|liturgical feast of the anniversary of its dedication]] on 5 August, a feast that was then denominated ''Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives'' (Dedication of Saint Mary of the Snows). This name for the basilica had become popular in the 14th century&lt;ref name=Calendarium&gt;{{harvnb|Calendarium Romanum|1969|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with a legend that the 1911 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] reports thus: "During the pontificate of [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]], the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honour. On 5 August, at the height of the Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary which they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honour of Mary on the very spot which was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged miracle until a few hundred years later, not even by [[Pope Sixtus III|Sixtus III]] in his eight-line dedicatory inscription ... it would seem that the legend has no historical basis."&lt;ref name="cathency"&gt;{{harvnb|Ott|1913|loc=Our Lady of the Snow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend is first reported only after AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020611054253/http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/SaintOfDay/default.asp?id=1098 Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica]&lt;/ref&gt; It may be implied in what the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', of the early 13th century, says of Pope Liberius: "He built the basilica of his own name (i.e. the Liberian Basilica) near the [[Macellum Liviae|Macellum of Livia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loomis|1916|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its prevalence in the 15th century is shown in the painting of the Miracle of the Snow by [[Masolino da Panicale]].&lt;ref name="Miles 1993157"&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1993|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;This triptych painted around 1423 was commissioned for the basilica by a member of the [[Colonna family]]; it is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples (Paul Joannides, "The Colonna Triptych by Masolino and Masaccio," ''Arte Cristiana'' no 728 (1988:339-)). The miracle is depicted as witnessed by a crowd of men and women, with Jesus and the Virgin Mary observing from above.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masolino, fondazione di santa maria maggiore.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] overlooking [[Pope Liberius]] as the [[Pontiff]] scrapes the foundation of the basilica into the snow. By Italian artist [[Masolino da Panicale]]. circa 15th-century. [[Museo di Capodimonte]]. ]]
The feast was originally called ''Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae'' (Dedication of Saint Mary's),&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; and was celebrated only in Rome until inserted for the first time into the [[General Roman Calendar]], with ''ad Nives'' added to its name, in 1568.&lt;ref name=Calendarium/&gt; A congregation appointed by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1741 proposed that the reading of the legend be struck from the Office and that the feast be given its original name.&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; No action was taken on the proposal until 1969, when the reading of the legend was removed and the feast was called ''In dedicatione Basilicae S. Mariae'' (Dedication of the Basilica of Saint Mary).&lt;ref name=Calendarium/&gt; The legend is still commemorated by dropping white [[rose]] petals from the [[dome]] during the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and Second [[Vespers]] of the feast.

The earliest building on the site was the '''Liberian Basilica''' or '''Santa Maria Liberiana''', after [[Pope Liberius]] (352–366). This name may have originated from the same legend, which recounts that, like John and his wife, Pope Liberius was told in a dream of the forthcoming summer snowfall, went in procession to where it did occur and there marked out the area on which the church was to be built.&lt;ref name=Parsch&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?id=218 Pius Parsch, ''The Church's Year of Grace'' quoted in Catholic Culture: "Ordinary Time, 5 August"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberiana'' is still included in some versions of the basilica's formal name, and "Liberian Basilica" may be used as a contemporary as well as historical name.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [[Holy See]]'s press office using "Papal Liberian Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome" in English [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_law_bf_en.html in a 2011 note] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303044547/http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_law_bf_en.html |date=3 March 2013 }}, while the [http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/vita_liturgica/informazioni.htm official Vatican website for the church] uses various formulas, some under a coat of arms that includes "basilica Liberiana" in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the name "Liberian Basilica" may be independent of the legend, since, according to Pius Parsch, Pope Liberius transformed a palace of the Sicinini family into a church, which was for that reason called the '''Sicinini Basilica'''. This building was then replaced under [[Pope Sixtus III]] (432–440) by the present structure dedicated to Mary.&lt;ref name=Parsch/&gt; However, some sources say that the adaptation as a church of a pre-existing building on the site of the present basilica was done in the 420s under [[Pope Celestine I]], the immediate predecessor of Sixtus III.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the earliest traces of the story of the miraculous snow, the church now known as Saint Mary Major was called '''Saint Mary of the Crib''' (''Sancta Maria ad Praesepe''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0220/__P2.HTM Encyclical ''Slavorum Apostoli''], 5&lt;/ref&gt; a name it was given because of its [[relic]] of the crib or manger of the Nativity of [[Jesus Christ]], four boards of sycamore wood believed to have been brought to the church, together with a fifth, in the time of [[Pope Theodore I]] (640–649).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Crib Stephen M.

Before 2006, the four Papal Major Basilicas, together with the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura|Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls]] were referred to as the "patriarchal basilicas" of Rome,&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;When [[Pope Benedict XVI]] abandoned the title "[[Patriarch of the West]]", the title of St. Mary Major changed from ''patriarchal'' to ''papal'' basilica, as on [http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/index_en.html its official website].&lt;/ref&gt; and were associated with the five ancient [[patriarch]]ates (see [[Pentarchy]]). St. Mary Major was associated with the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Patriarch and Patriarchate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five Papal Basilicas along with the [[Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem]] (actually in Rome) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] were the traditional [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome]], which were visited by pilgrims during their pilgrimage to Rome following a {{convert|20|km}} itinerary established by [[Philip Neri|St. Philip Neri]] on 25 February 1552.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oratoriosanfilippo.org/visita-sette-chiese.pdf La Visita alle Sette Chiese]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panvinio|first=Onofrio|title=Le sette chiese romane|year=1570|location=Rome|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SozbdUVZnycC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sacchi|first=Guido|title=La visita alle Sette Chiese: cenni storici|url=http://www.gliscritti.it/approf/luogiub/settechiese.htm#appel2|accessdate=12 August 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued a [[Papal bull]] granting equal indulgences of the basilica for pilgrims who travel to the [[Minor Basilica]] of [[Our Lady of Manaoag]].

==History of the present church==
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - The Piazza and Church of Santa Maria Maggiore.jpg|thumb|The Piazza and Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]]]]

It is agreed that the present church was built under [[Pope Sixtus III]] (432–440). The dedicatory inscription on the triumphal arch, ''Sixtus Episcopus plebi Dei'', (Sixtus the bishop to the people of God) is an indication of that Pope's role in the construction.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49" /&gt; As well as this church on the summit of the [[Esquiline Hill]], Pope Sixtus III is said to have commissioned extensive building projects throughout the city, which were continued by his successor [[Pope Leo I]], the Great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church retains the core of its original structure, despite several additional construction projects and damage by the [[earthquake of 1348]].

Church building in Rome in this period, as exemplified in Saint Mary Major, was inspired by the idea of Rome being not just the centre of the world of the [[Roman Empire]], as it was seen in the classical period, but the centre of the Christian world.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer46"&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the first churches built in honour of the Virgin Mary, was erected in the immediate aftermath of the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] of 431, which proclaimed Mary Mother of God. [[Pope Sixtus III]] built it to commemorate this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilaki|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the atmosphere that generated the council gave rise also the mosaics that adorn the interior of the dedication: "whatever the precise connection was between council and church it is clear that the planners of the decoration belong to a period of concentrated debates on nature and status of the Virgin and incarnate Christ."&lt;ref name="Corm889"/&gt; The magnificent [[mosaics]] of the nave and triumphal arch, seen as "milestones in the depiction" of the Virgin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilaki|2000|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; depict scenes of her life and that of Christ, but also scenes from the [[Old Testament]]: Moses striking the [[Red Sea]], and Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea.

Richard Krautheimer attributes the magnificence of the work also to the abundant revenue accruing to the papacy at the time from land holdings acquired by the Church during the 4th and 5th centuries on the Italian peninsula: "Some of these holdings were locally controlled; the majority as early as the end of the 5th century were administered directly from Rome with great efficiency: a central accounting system was involved in the papal chancery; and a budget was apparently prepared, one part of the income going to the papal administration, another to the needs of the clergy, a third to the maintenance of church buildings, a fourth to charity. These fines enabled the papacy to carry out through the 5th century an ambitious building program, including Santa Maria Maggiore."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miri Rubin believes that the building of the basilica was influenced also by seeing Mary as one who could represent the imperial ideals of classical Rome, bringing together the old Rome and the new Christian Rome:  "In Rome, the city of [[martyr]]s, if no longer of emperors, Mary was a figure that could credibly carry imperial memories and representations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2009|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory the Great may have been inspired by Byzantine devotions to the Theotokos (Mother of God) when after becoming Pope during a plague in 590 that had taken the life of his predecessor, he ordered for seven processions to march through the city of Rome chanting Psalms and Kyrie Eleison, in order to appease the wrath of God. The processions began in different parts of the city, but rather than finally converging on St Peter's, who was always the traditional protector of Rome, he instead ordered the processions to converge on Mary Major instead.&lt;ref&gt; Andrew J. Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and Greek Popes. Lexington Books, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;  

When the popes returned to Rome after the period of the [[Avignon papacy]], the buildings of the basilica became a temporary [[Palace of the Popes (disambiguation)|Palace of the Popes]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} due to the deteriorated state of the [[Lateran Palace]]. The papal residence was later moved to the [[Palace of the Vatican]] in what is now [[Vatican City]].

The basilica was restored, redecorated and extended by various popes, including [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] (1145–1153), [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]] (1288–92), [[Pope Clement X|Clement X]] (1670–76), and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]] (1740–58), who in the 1740s commissioned [[Ferdinando Fuga]] to build the present façade and to modify the interior. The interior of the Santa Maria Maggiore underwent a broad renovation encompassing all of its altars between the years 1575 and 1630.

On 15 December 2015, a [[Palestine (state)|Palestinian]] and a [[Tunisia]]n national were arrested after they tried to disarm soldiers stationed outside the basilica while yelling "[[Takbir|Allah (God) is great]]". When police intervened, the two men aged 40 and 30 called other foreigners in the area to their aid, and assaulted and threatened the arresting officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/12/15/two-homeless-arabs-attack-soldiers-at-rome-cathedral_1eb5f4d1-1270-42b9-b46f-fa6ade40d53f.html ANSA Italy News Service], accessed 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Piazza Esquilino, Santa Maria Maggiore.JPG|thumb|Piazza dell'Esquilino with the apse area of Santa Maria Maggiore.]]
The original architecture of Santa Maria Maggiore was classical and traditionally [[Roman architecture|Roman]] perhaps to convey the idea that Santa Maria Maggiore represented old imperial Rome as well as its Christian future. As one scholar puts it, "Santa Maria Maggiore so closely resembles a second-century imperial [[basilica]] that it has sometimes been thought to have been adapted from a basilica for use as a Christian church. Its plan was based on [[Hellenistic]] principles stated by [[Vitruvius]] at the time of [[Augustus]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1993|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Santa Maria Maggiore is immense in its area, it was built to plan. The design of the basilica was a typical one during this time in Rome: "a tall and wide nave; an aisle on either side; and a semicircular apse at the end of the nave."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer46"/&gt; The key aspect that made Santa Maria Maggiore such a significant cornerstone in church building during the early 5th century were the beautiful [[mosaics]] found on the triumphal arch and nave. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[File:Detail of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the external façade of the apse on the north-west of the church on Piazza dell'Esquilino]]

The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beny|Gunn|1981|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th century [[campanile]], or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 246 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica's 16th-century coffered ceiling, to a design by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], is said to be gilded with gold, initially brought by [[Christopher Columbus]], presented by [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] to the Spanish pope, [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles A. Coulombe]], ''Vicars of Christ'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The apse mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], is from 1295, signed by the [[Franciscan]] friar, [[Jacopo Torriti]]. The Basilica also contains frescoes by [[Giovanni Baglione]], in the Cappella Borghese. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The 12th-century façade has been masked by a reconstruction, with a screening loggia, that were added by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743, to designs by [[Ferdinando Fuga]] that did not damage the mosaics of the façade. The wing of the ''canonica'' ([[sacristy]]) to its left and a matching wing to the right (designed by [[Flaminio Ponzio]]) give the basilica's front the aspect of a palace facing the ''Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore''. To the right of the Basilica's façade is a memorial representing a column in the form of an up-ended cannon barrel topped with a cross: it was erected by [[Pope Clement VIII]] to celebrate the end of the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/romeartlover/Vasi48.html Basilica memorial to celebrate the end of the French Wars of Religion]; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marian column erected in 1614, to designs of [[Carlo Maderno]] is the model for numerous [[Marian column]]s erected in Catholic countries in thanksgiving for remission of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during the [[Baroque]] era. (An example is the [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], the [[Czech Republic]]). The column itself is the sole remainder from Constantine's [[Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]] in ''[[Roman Forum|Campo Vaccino]]'' Rome Art Lover website notes that Campo Vaccino as what the Roman Forum was called until the 18th century. Maderno's fountain at the base combines the armorial eagles and dragons of Paul V.

==Interior==

===Fifth century mosaics===
[[File:Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore (Rome).jpg|thumb|Interior of the basilica: view down the nave towards the high altar]]

The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are one of the oldest representations of the Virgin Mary in Christian [[Late Antiquity]]. As one scholar puts it, "This is well demonstrated by the decoration of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome,... where the iconographic depiction of the Virgin Mary was chosen at least in part to celebrate the affirmation of Mary as [[Theotokos]] (bearer of God) by the third ecumenical [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 CE."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gwynn|Bangert|2010|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave in Santa Maria Maggiore were the definition of [[impressionistic]] art during the time period and gave a model for the future representations of the Virgin Mary. The influences of these mosaics are rooted in late antique impressionism that could be seen in [[frescoes]], manuscript paintings and many pavement mosaics across villas in Africa, [[Syria]] and [[Sicily]] during the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49"&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mosaics gave historians insight into artistic, religious, and social movements during this time. As Margaret Miles explains the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore have two goals: one to glorify the Virgin Mary as Theotokos (God-Bearer); and the other to present "a systematic and comprehensive articulation of the relationship of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian scriptures as one in which the Hebrew Bible foreshadows Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1993|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by the dual images of [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] events depicted in the mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave. The mosaics also show the range of artistic expertise and refute the theory that mosaic technique during the time was based on copying from model books. The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are combinations of different styles of mosaic art during the time, according to art scholar Robin Cormack: "the range of artistic expertise and the actual complexities of production can hardly be reduced to a mentality of copying. A test case is given by the mosaics of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome".&lt;ref name="Corm889"&gt;{{harvnb|Cormack|2000|p=889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triumphal arch====
[[File:RomaSantaMariaMaggioreArcoTrionfaleDxRegistro4.jpg|thumb|Detail of the mosaic in the triumphal arch, showing Bethlehem]]
The triumphal arch at the head of the nave was at first referred to as the [[apse]] arch, but later became known as the triumphal arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triumphal arch is illustrated with magnificent mosaics depicting different scenes of Christ and the Virgin Mary. There was a difference in the styles used in the triumphal arch mosaics compared to those of the nave; the style of the triumphal arch was much more linear and flat as one scholar describes it, not nearly as much action, emotion and movement in them as there were in the Old Testament mosaics of the nave.&lt;ref name="Corm889"/&gt; One of the first scenes that were visible on the triumphal arch was a panel of Christ's enthronement with a group of angels as his court. As one historian describes it: "On the apse arch Christ is enthroned, a young emperor attended by four [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlains]], angels of course",&lt;ref name="Krautheimer46"/&gt; this is a perfect example of mosaic art in the 5th century. Another panel found on the triumphal arch is of the Virgin, she is crowned and dressed in a colorful veil, her wardrobe subtly brings to mind that of a Roman empress and in this panel she has her divine son walking with her and a suite of angels and Joseph ready to greet her; "The Virgin...shows to perfection the impressionistic character of mosaics."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another panel is known as the [[Adoration]] of the [[Magi]] and this mosaic depicts Infant Christ and The Virgin and the arrival of the three wise men, "mosaics illustrating Christ's first coming and his youth covered the triumphal arch."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 48"/&gt; The other panel depicts the Virgin accompanied by five martyrs.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49"/&gt;

====Nave====
[[File:SMM Nave Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|A nave mosaic from the story of Moses]]
[[File:Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore abside a Roma.jpg|thumb|The apse of the basilica]]
The nave of the basilica was covered in mosaics representing Old Testament events of [[Moses]] leading the [[Jews]] out of [[Egypt]] across the Red Sea. "The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new 'past') are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner"&lt;ref name="Corm889"/&gt; as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome's "new" past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: "Moses strikes the waters of the Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; the man next to him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49"/&gt; Another panel shows the demise of the [[Egyptians]] in the [[Red Sea]]. An observer describes the mosaic: "The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 48"/&gt;

==Crypt of the Nativity and Cappella Sistina==
[[File:Sacra culla.jpg|thumb|Reliquary of the Holy Crib]]
Under the high altar of the basilica is the '''Crypt of the Nativity''' or ''Bethlehem Crypt'', with a crystal reliquary designed by [[Giuseppe Valadier]] said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/storia/interno.htm Inside the Basilica]&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the burial place of [[Saint Jerome]], the 4th-century [[Doctor of the Church]] who translated the Bible into the [[Latin|Latin language]] (the [[Vulgate]]).&lt;ref name=Destinations&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-santa-maria-maggiore Sacred Destinations: SantaMariaMaggiore, Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santa Maria Maggiore (Rome) 06.jpg|thumb|left|Altar of Sistine Chapel and Oratory of the Nativity]]
Fragments of the sculpture of the Nativity believed to be by 13th-century [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] were transferred to beneath the altar of the large Sistine Chapel&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt; off the right transept of the church. This chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is named after [[Pope Sixtus V]], and is not to be confused with the [[Sistine Chapel]] of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], named after [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The architect [[Domenico Fontana]] designed the chapel, which contains the tombs of Sixtus V himself and of his early patron [[Pope Pius V]]. The main altar in the chapel has four gilded bronze angels by Sebastiano Torregiani, holding up the [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], which is a model of the chapel itself.

Beneath this altar is the Oratory or Chapel of the Nativity, on whose altar, at that time situated in the Crypt of the Nativity below the main altar of the church itself, [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] celebrated his first Mass as a priest on 25 December 1538.

Just outside the Sistine Chapel is the tomb of [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] and his family.&lt;ref name=Destinations/&gt;

The [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] interior decoration of the Sistine Chapel was completed (1587–1589) by a large team of artists, directed by [[Cesare Nebbia]] and [[Giovanni Guerra]]. While the art biographer, [[Giovanni Baglione]] allocates specific works to individual artists, recent scholarship finds that the hand of Nebbia drew preliminary sketches for many, if not all, of the frescoes. Baglione also concedes the roles of Nebbia and Guerra could be summarized as "Nebbia drew, and Guerra supervised the teams".

==Borghese Chapel and Salus Populi Romani==
[[File:Santamariamaggiore2b.jpg|thumb|right|The Borghese Chapel]]
The column in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore celebrates the famous [[icon]] of the Virgin Mary now enshrined in the Borghese Chapel of the basilica. It is known as ''[[Salus Populi Romani]],'' or ''Health of the Roman People'' or ''Salvation of the Roman People'', due to a miracle in which the icon reportedly helped keep plague from the city. The icon is at least a thousand years old, and according to a tradition was painted from life by [[Luke the Evangelist|St Luke the Evangelist]] using the wooden table of the [[Holy Family]] in [[Nazareth]].

[[File:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.5|[[Salus Populi Romani]], perhaps the oldest [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian image]] in Rome.]]
The [[Salus Populi Romani]] has been a favourite of several popes and acted as a key [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] symbol. Roman-born [[Pope Pius XII]] (Eugenio Pacelli) celebrated his first Holy Mass there on 1 April 1899. In 1953, the icon was carried through Rome to initiate the first Marian year in church history. In 1954, the icon was crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]] as he introduced a new Marian feast [[Queenship of Mary]]. [[Pope Paul VI]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]], and [[Pope Francis]] all honoured the Salus Populi Romani with personal visits and liturgical celebrations.

==Papal basilica==
As a papal basilica, Santa Maria Maggiore is often used by the pope. He presides over the rites for the annual [[Feast of the Assumption of Mary]] on 15 August there. Except for a few priests and the basilica's archpriest, the [[baldachin|canopied]] high altar is reserved for use by the pope alone. [[Pope Francis]] visited the basilica on the day after his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate = 28 December 2016 | title= Pope Francis eschews trappings of papacy on first day in office | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/14/pope-francis-style-first-day | date= 14 March 2013 | work = The Guardian | first= Lizzy | last = Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope gives charge of the basilica to an archpriest, usually a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. Formerly, the archpriest was the titular [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]], a title abolished in 1964. Since 29 December 2016, the archpriest has been [[Stanisław Ryłko]].

In addition to the archpriest and his assistant priests, a chapter of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] is resident. [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] and [[dominican order|Dominican]] priests serve the church.

The [[King of Spain]], currently [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]], is ''ex officio'' [[protopriest|protocanon]] of the basilica's [[Canon (priest)|chapter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/capitolo/capitolo.htm Liberian Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

List of archpriests of the Liberian Basilica since 1127.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moroni|1840|pp=127–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Respective biographical entries on [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/essay.htm Essay of a General List of Cardinals] by Salvador Miranda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferri|1904|loc= p. 147–202 and 441–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferri|1905|pp=23–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferri|1907|pp=119–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially not all archpriests were cardinals
{{colbegin|colwidth=22em}}
* Rainiero (attested 1127–1130)
* Matteo (attested 1153)
* [[Pope Clement III|Paolo Scolari]] (attested 1176–1187)
* Rolando (attested 1189–1193)
* Pietro Sasso (attested 1212)&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Archpriest Pietro Sasso is commonly identified with contemporary cardinal Pietro Sasso of S. Pudenziana (1206–1218/19). However, this identification remains uncertain because the only document which mentions this archpriest (dated 3 July 1212) makes no reference to his cardinalate, cf. Ferri in ASRSP, vol. 28, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Romano (attested 1222)
* Astor (attested 1244)
* Pietro Capocci (?) (named in 1245?)&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Cardinal Pietro Capocci (died 1259) is mentioned in the majority of the catalogs of archpriests of Liberian Basilica but the documents from the archive of the Basilica, published by Ferri in ASRSP, vol. 27, p. 34–39 and vol. 30, p. 119, give no support for this affirmation. Document dated 19 March 1244 mentions Astor (or Aston) as archpriest, documents between 13 February 1247 and 1 October 1255 mention archpriest without mentioning his name but also without indicating his cardinalate, and on 28 May 1258 Romano was archpriest of the Basilica; the latest document mentions also cardinal Pietro Capocci but makes no reference to his occupation of that post. If he was really an archpriest under Innocent IV, he must have later resigned, but it seems more likely that this statement resulted from a confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}
Sculptures have been an indispensable part of Bangladeshi culture. The earliest sculptures in Bangladesh discovered so far date back to the 3rd century [[Before Christ|BC]]. Since the ancient times, sculptures have been serving as a substantial manifestation of the profound heritage of [[Culture of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi culture]] and [[History of Bangladesh|history]].

== Historic significance ==
Sculptures have been a key of source of rendering the historic identity of the ancient Bangladesh. Even though the art of sculptures in Bangladesh began almost 2500 years ago, it mostly flourished during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]], [[Pala empire|Pala]] and [[Sena Empire|Sena dynasty]] all of which belong to the early Middle Ages (1–1200 CE).

=== Gupta Sculptures ===
The Gupta rulers were devoted [[Vaishnava]]s, and early Gupta sculptures are found to be mostly representations of [[Vishnu]] or any of his incarnations. The earliest example of this seems to be the Vishnu from Machmoil Bagmara in the district of [[Rajshahi district|Rajshahi]] carved in grey [[sandstone]]. The image shows a broken form of the god in a strict frontally standing pose. Though modelling and iconic features betray its early Gupta style, its aesthetic attainment is so negligible that it may be stylistically placed in a point of transition between the [[Kusana]] and the Gupta phases. The image is preserved with quite a number of other Vishnus of the Gupta period in the [[Varendra Research Museum]]. The Gupta sculptures of Bangladesh are mostly icons and their forms were determined by the characteristics of the gods as prescribed by the priests of [[Central India]].

=== Pala Sculptures ===
During more than four hundred years of Pala rule (8th–12th century AD), many centres of sculptural art flourished simultaneously in different regions of the extensive empire of Bangladesh. The products of these centres were not only varied but also numerous. Thousands of sculptures of this period have been discovered and they now form part of the collections of a number of museums in Bangladesh. Many of them have also found their ways into a number of museums in Europe and America. Most of these sculptures have been found through the excavations in [[Somapura Mahavihara]]. Pala sculpture derives its origins from the late Gupta style, but later on deviated from it.

=== Sena sculptures ===
A large number of sculptures representing [[Hindu gods]] and [[Hindu goddesses|goddesses]] belong to the phase of artistic activity initiated under the Sena rulers (c 1097–1223 AD). From the artistic point of view, Sena sculpture is a continuation of the Pala style in vogue till the late 11th century AD. The slender body form of the late Pala period sculpture is retained in the Sena period, but the modelling quality shows a marked deterioration.

== Materials ==
Most of the ancient sculptures discovered in Bangladesh are made of [[terracotta]], [[bronze]], [[black stone]] etc. The earliest sculptures were made of terracotta dating back as early as 3rd century BC. The trend of using bronze for sculptures started from the 7th century. The black stone sculptures also originated from that period.

=== Terracotta ===
The history of terracotta sculpture in Bangladesh starts from the [[Mauryan]] age (324–187 BC). It is believed that in pre-Mauryan times it was the [[Matrika]] (Mother-Goddess) statues that dominated. From the presentation and aesthetic standard of the [[Mauryan]] sculpture it can be inferred that the art had a long and continuous heritage. These sculptures became much more elegant, refined, well-shaped and worldly in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.

=== Bronze ===
The trend of using bronze in sculptures started in the 7th century CE mainly from the [[Chittagong division|Chittagong region]]. As the region was dominated by believers of [[Buddhism]], most of these earliest bronze sculptures were depictions of [[Gautam Buddha]]. However, later on sculptures depicting the Hindu deities were also made with bronze.

=== Black stone ===
Stone sculptures so far discovered from Bangladesh that are assignable to the first three centuries of the [[Common era]] are few. These sculptures in general represent a style, which is, in the development of the art in [[North India]], recognised as related to the [[Kusana]]s. The centre of the art was [[Mathura]], where evolved during the period the images of the deities worshipped by the followers of the three major religions of the time, namely, [[Brahmanism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

== Religious depictions ==
The Bangladeshi sculptures, especially those belonging to the ancient and early Middle Ages mostly depict the Hindu deities and the deities worshiped by the Buddhists, especially Gautam Buddha. Thus, these sculptures can be divided in two major categories considering their religious significance.

=== Hindu Sculptures ===
Sculptures depicting the [[Hindu deity]] fall in this category. The beginning of the art of Hindu sculptures is believed to be from the [[Gupta]] period. Most of these sculptures depicts the Hindu deity called [[Vishnu]]. Many of them also depict the deities namely [[Durga]], [[Brahma]], [[Ganesha]] and others. [[Mahishamardini]] figure from Sarsabaz, [[Bogra]], now in the [[Mahasthangarh]] Museum is the most magnificent early image of the deity not only from Bangladesh but from the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

=== Buddhist sculptures ===
These sculptures mostly depict the [[Gautam Buddha]] and Buddhist believes. The oldest Buddhist sculptures in Bangladesh are believed to be the belongings of the ancient kingdom of [[Pundravardhana]]. These sculptures are discovered from the archaeological sites, most of which situated in the [[Rajshahi division|Rajshahi]] and [[Rangpur division|Rangpur region]] of the country.

== Modern Sculptures ==
Sculptures, created after the independence of Bangladesh can be referred as modern sculptures. Most of these sculptures depict the gallant struggle of Bangladeshis during the [[Bangladesh liberation war]]. Some notable sculptures depicting the liberation war are [[Aparajeyo Bangla]], [[Shabash Bangladesh]], Jagroto Chowrongi, Pataka Ekattor by Rupam Roy, Imran Hossain Piplu and Muhammad Ziaul Huq Shimul etc. [[Nitun Kundu]], Shyamal Choudhury, [[Mrinal Haque]] are some of the notable modern sculptors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">A '''special effects supervisor''' (also referred to as a '''special effects coordinator''' or '''SFX Supervisor''') is an individual who works on a [[television advertisement|commercial]], [[theater]], [[television]] or [[film]] set creating [[special effects]]. The supervisor generally is the department head who defers to the film's director and/or producers, and who is in charge of the entire special effects team. Special effects include anything that is manual or mechanically manipulated (also called "[[practical effect]]s" or [[in camera]] effects).&lt;ref name="Jobs"&gt;[http://www.media-match.com/jobtypes/job-descriptions.php Media Match "TV and Film Job Descriptions"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/glossary/S IMDB Glossary letter "S": Special Effects Supervisor]&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the use of mechanized [[Theatrical property|props]], special effects makeup, [[theatrical property|props]], [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[scale model]]s, [[pyrotechnics]] and atmospheric effects: creating physical wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds etc.

Special effects (SFX) or (SPFX) are produced on the set, as opposed to those created in post-production which are generally called "visual effects" (VFX). In recent years real physical special effects have been increasingly overshadowed by [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) effects created in [[post-production]]."&lt;ref name="Jobs" /&gt;

Some examples of special effects are explosions, car crashes and chases, gunshots, earthquake effects, special makeup, prosthetics, special set construction, snow and rain.

'''Special Effects Technician''' is a person working in the [[special effects]] department, under the special effects supervisor, and he is responsible for creating and assisting special effects. Major motion pictures, with many special effects many have many special effects technicians.

==Skills==

A special effects supervisor has to ensure the safety of his/her crew and everyone else on set.&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/special-effects-supervisor Special Effects Supervisor]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the cameras start rolling, local officials may step onto set and perform inspections, so knowledge of the law and safety protocols helps when using explosives and firearms during the production process.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; Specific education programs are recommended for one to gain high awareness in health and safety. Other training in various fields such as handling explosives, firearms, high voltage and other hazardous material and equipment helps.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; One should be familiar with all the necessary equipment such as wind, snow, fog, fire and rain machines, as well as dummies and body parts. On set, the supervisor is the one in charge of setting up and operating these gears. Creativity and imagination plays a big role in this occupation, for he/she is the one responsible to see the big picture of the script and know when and how a special effect should be implemented. He/she should have the ability to visualize how things will appear ‘on screen.’&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;[http://education-portal.com/special_effects_career.html Special Effects Career Information and Education Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong communication skills and presentation skills are an asset because being able to show such skills during the interview process proves personal responsibility and willing to collaborate with others.&lt;ref name="Work"&gt;[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/special-effects-artist.htm How Special Effects Artists Work]&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the head of the entire special effects team works closely with the [[production designer]] and [[art director]].&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; The supervisor plans a special effects scene and presents it to the director, in hope that he/she will be pleased with the results. Experience in photography may be an advantage in this job because as the supervisor, he/she has to plan the camera angles when shooting special effects scenes. Starting young allows one to absorb all the information and experience you can get and applying them to become a special effects artist.&lt;ref name="Work" /&gt;

===Education===

Entry into this career path is competitive. There are various paths that one can take in order to become a special effects supervisor. People with [[animation]], [[computer science]], and [[industrial design]] backgrounds are seen.&lt;ref name="Work" /&gt; A formal education, particularly in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering is suggested. Some enter into this profession with a degree in film and television production, which is useful.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; Some students may specialize in [[fine art]] or sculpture, which may enhance their techniques to apply to special effects careers in modeling, [[illustration]], [[animation]] and much more.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt; Being good with computer software saves a company time and money to invest in training their new employees. Modern special effects tend to be computer generated nowadays, blending physical techniques and digital tricks.&lt;ref name="Work" /&gt; Taking classes related to computer graphics gives people insight on computer animation software that he/she may come into contact with. Several years of employment experience at the junior level is necessary before one takes on this senior-level role as a supervisor. [[Special effects]] are a form of science, so courses in [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]] and [[Biology]] are recommended.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; To have an understanding in advanced mathematics allows preparing the department budget and crew scheduling easier.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; Education in any of these fields gives a person valuable experience that he/she may be able to apply to their career.

'''The Bee and the Orange Tree''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].

==Synopsis==
After many childless years, a king and queen had a daughter, whom they named Aimée. Unfortunately, a ship she was on, wrecked. As fate would have it, she drifted ashore in her cradle.  There, an [[ogre]] couple found her, and the ogress resolved to raise Aimee, instead of eating her, resolving that the infant would make a good wife for her son when she grew up.  The ogress summoned a hind from the woods to nurse the baby.  After fifteen years, the king and queen gave up hope of locating the princess and the king told his brother to send his best son to be the heir to the throne.  The brother chose his second son.

Meanwhile, Aimee grew up among the ogres.  A little ogre had fallen in love with her, but the thought of marrying him revolted her.  She regularly walked along the shore after storms, to protect things swept ashore from the ogres, and one day she found a man.  She saved the man, who happened to be her cousin, although neither of them knew the truth or could speak each other's language.  She managed to make him understand that he had to hide in a cave.  After some time hiding and feeding him, she wished to show her friendship and gave him a locket she wore.  This had her name on it, and the prince deduced from her looks that she was indeed his cousin, the princess Aimee.

The little ogre decided it was time for them to marry, and horror-struck, Aimee fled to the prince.  When she returned, she injured her foot on a thorn and could no longer walk.  The prince wondered why she did not come, and when he tried to find her, he was captured.

Now, every night, the ogres all put on golden crowns before they went to bed.  The princess snuck in that night, took a crown from the head of a little ogre, and put it on the prince's head.  The ogre woke up, seized on the sleeping little ogre who no longer had a crown, and ate him.  Again the next night, the princess stole a crown from one of the ogres to place on the Prince's head.  This time, the ogress ate the crown-less ogre.

The princess remembered the magic wand that the ogress had used to summon the hind.  With it, she gave herself the power to speak the prince's language.  He told her who she was, and the princess decided to steal the ogres' camel so they could ride away to safety.  She used the wand to enchant a bean to hide their escape.  It spoke whenever the ogress asked anything.  Finally, however, the ogress realized they had fled.  The ogre used his [[seven-league boots]] to follow.

When the ogre caught up, the princess [[Shapeshifting|turned]] herself into a boatwoman, the prince into a boat, and the camel into a lake; to confuse the ogre.  He found nothing, but when he returned, the ogress told him how they had been transformed with her stolen magic wand, and so he set out to find them again.  This time Aimmee turned herself into a dwarf, the prince into a portrait, and the camel into a pillar.  When the ogre reached her, she told an elaborate story about how the prince had fought in a tournament in honor of the lady in the picture.  Confused again, the ogre returned home.

This time the ogress came after them.  The princess turned the prince into an orange tree, herself into a bee, and the camel into a box.  The princess stung the ogress and drove her off, but some travelers carried off the wand.  Without the wand, the Princess was unable to change the group back into their prior forms.

A princess, Linda, loved to walk in the woods where the orange tree stood.  Linda tried to have the tree transplanted into her gardens, Aimee stung Linda out of jealousy.  This caused the prince and princess to quarrel, but they soon reconciled.  When Linda tried again, Aimee stung her again.  Linda tried to arm herself with a branch, but when she did, blood flowed from the tree.  Aimee went to fetch a balm for the wound.

A fairy visited the princess and when she detected the enchantment, the fairy restored the prince.  He told his story, and she restored Aimee as well, and then brought them to her parents, where they married.

'''The Book of the White Earl''' is an [[Ireland|Irish]] religious and literary [[miscellany]] created c. 1404&amp;ndash;1452. 

''The Book of the White Earl'', now '''Bodleian Laud Misc. MS 610''', consists of twelve folios inserted into [[Leabhar na Rátha]], aka [[The Book of Pottlerath]]. It was created by [[Irish language|Gaelic]] [[scribes]] under the patronage of [[James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond]] (1392–1452). Henry and Marsh-Michel describe it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"The sumptuous initials of this book are not more or less servile repetition of twelfth-century work ... the work of the scribe also is dazzling. He plays like a virtuoso with various sizes of script, the larger size having a majestic decorative quality. The contents are no less remarkable; the '[[Martyrology of Óengus]]', the '[[Acallam na Senórach]]' and a dindsenchus. The foliage pattern is probably inspired by foreign models, but is so completely integrated that the borrowing is only realised on second thoughts. The initials are large, bold, and drawn in firm lines and bright colours"''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Butler was known to have been strongly [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. He was an Irish-speaker and seems to have been the very first of the [[Anglo-Irish]] lords to appoint a [[brehon]], Domhnall Mac Flannachadha, for his service. Butler granted Mac Flannchadha lands in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]].

'''''The Montgomery County Bulletin''''' or simply '''''The Bulletin''''' was a free [[alternative weekly]] newspaper distributed in [[Montgomery County, Texas]]; a suburban county north of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. It claimed a circulation of 20,000 copies before being forced out of business in 2008 due to evidence of massive [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2196875/|title=Scanned excerpt of The Bulletin|date=2008-08-06|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP-reply"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2008/08/montgomery_county_plagiarism.php|title=R.I.P., Plagiarizing Montgomery County Paper|last=Downing|first=Margaret|date=2008-08-08|publisher=[[Houston Press]] blog|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/61988/montgomery-county-bulletin-the-big-ripoff/|title=Montgomery County Bulletin’s Big Ripoff|last=Gross|first=Jason|date=2008-08-11|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The paper was founded in 1969 as a [[pennysaver|shopper]].  In 1998, Mike Ladyman, former publisher of ''Wheels'' magazine (no relation to the [[Wheels (magazine)|Australian publication]]) bought the paper and turned it into an alternative weekly.  He largely ran it as a mom-and-pop business, delivering the paper himself.  He largely left the writing to Mark Williams, a freelance writer who was listed as a staff reporter and music editor.&lt;ref name="HP-reply"/&gt;

In Ladyman's first year of ownership, the ''Bulletin'' received the "Most Improved Newspaper" award from the [[Texas Community Newspaper Association]].&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;

==Plagiarism scandal==

In late July 2008, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' music critic Jody Rosen got word that a Williams piece about [[Jimmy Buffett]] that appeared in the March 2008 ''Bulletin'' was almost a verbatim copy of a 2007 piece Rosen had written for ''Slate''.  Rosen did a search on [[Google]], and discovered that all of Williams' articles dating back to at least 2005 had been copied wholesale from numerous sources.  Williams appeared to have stolen work from diverse publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[salon.com]]'', ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the ''[[Boston Globe]]''. The Buffett article that triggered his initial inquiry, for instance, had been lifted from Rosen's 2007 piece and two other articles.  He also found at that Williams had stolen at least one of his other articles for ''Slate.''&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/5931508.html|title=Montgomery Co. weekly faces plagiarism accusations|author=C. Shropshire and M. Casady|date=2008-08-07|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OTM&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812013709/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/08/08/03 Free Copy]. [[NPR]] and [[WNYC]], 2008-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Rosen obtained a copy of the ''Bulletin's'' latest issue, and found that nearly every article in it appeared to have been plagiarized.  Rosen suggested that "in purely statistical terms, [...] the articles in the Montgomery County Bulletin [may] amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of American journalism".
&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2196810/|title=Dude, You Stole My Article|last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=2008-08-06|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rosen published his article on August 6, 2008; some observers suggested that Mark Williams was simply a ''[[nom de plume]]'' of Mike Ladyman, but in a ''[[Houston Press]]'' interview Ladyman denied the charge and called ''Slate's'' piece “an attack, an attention-grabbing hatchet job”. He also complained of Rosen's attitude in the affair and claimed that he was not given sufficient time and details to react appropriately and diligently. “The mistake I made was not working fast enough for Jody Rosen and apparently I needed to be punished for it.”&lt;ref name="HP-reply"/&gt; Ladyman announced he was shutting down ''The Bulletin''', and blamed Williams for the plagiarism. Williams himself published a bitter and sarcastic open letter to Rosen in which he wrote, describing himself as the victim of the critic's quest for [[blogosphere]] fame: "Of course, you are certainly owed an apology, but one has to ponder for a moment just why that is; after all, you have most definitely garnered the attention of the bloggers that you evidently crave in abundance with this manufactured scandal." Williams claimed that he had not intentionally plagiarized articles but had simply used [[press kit]] material without realizing that they included work of other journalists: "I did so thinking it was cleared for such use; but, as [Rosen] so subtly pointed out, I was mistaken."&lt;ref name="HP-reply"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; In turn, Rosen contested the timeline presented by Ladyman, and blamed him for shunning his responsibilities as the newspaper's editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2008/08/jody_rosen_slate_montgomer_cou.php|title=Jody Rosen of Slate Responds, Deals With A Squalling Kid|last=Downing|first=Margaret|date=2008-08-08|publisher=[[Houston Press]] blog|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal also spawned discussion on the thin line which separates plagiarism from very commonplace [[news aggregator|news aggregation]]. In the conclusion of his piece, Rosen quipped "Mike Ladyman and company may simply be bringing guerrilla-style 21st-century content aggregation to 20th-century print media: publishing the [[Napster]] of newspapers." &lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2225/aggregation-vs-plagiarism-a-modern-problem-hits-an-old-medium/|title=Aggregation vs. Plagiarism: A Modern Problem Hits an Old Medium |author=JR Raphael|date=2008-08-07|publisher=The Inquisitr|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2008/08/08/the-slate-the-bulletin-and-the-plagiarist/|title=The Slate, The Bulletin and The Plagiarist|author=Jonathan Bailey|date=2008-08-08|publisher=Plagiarism Today|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Craig Silverman]] of Regret the Error described the ''Bulletin'' as "perhaps the first newspaper to pursue plagiarism as a standard operating procedure."&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Craig. [http://www.regrettheerror.com/2008/12/16/crunks-2008-the-year-in-media-errors-and-corrections Crunks 2008: The Year in Media Errors and Corrections]. Regret The Error, 2008-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosen was a guest on [[NPR]]'s ''[[On the Media]]'' on August 8, 2008.  He suggested that the ''Bulletin'' really didn't need a Website because it was a free paper supported by advertising in the print edition.  He thought that Williams' plagiarism probably would have gone unnoticed had not the paper's Website opened it up to being searched on Google.&lt;ref name=OTM/&gt;

'''''The Dance Lesson''''' (sometimes known as '''''The Dancing Lesson''''') is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by the French artist [[Edgar Degas]] created around 1879. It is currently kept at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] There is at least one other work by Degas by this title, also made in about 1879, which is a [[pastel]].&lt;ref name=pastel&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum|title=The Dance Lesson (pastel)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000571|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting is the first of a series of about 40 pictures that Degas painted in this horizontal, frieze-like format.&lt;ref name=natgal&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dance Lesson|url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=93045|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures {{convert|38|x|88|cm}}.&lt;ref name=natgal/&gt;

To the far left is a [[double bass]] with an exhausted dancer wearing a bright orange shawl sitting on it.&lt;ref name=natgal/&gt;&lt;ref name=willis&gt;{{cite news|last=Willis|first=Margaret|title=Degas and the Ballet: Picturing Movement Exhibition|url=http://www.ballet.co.uk/2011/09/degas-and-the-ballet-picturing-movement-exhibition/|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Balletco|date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also an open [[violin]]-case, which although painted out, is still visible.&lt;ref name=natgal/&gt; In the centre of the painting is a dancer in a pink shawl sitting on a chair with another dancer, turned away, standing just behind her adjusting the dark coloured sash of her dress.&lt;ref name=natgal/&gt; To the far right, at the back of the room, is a group of dancers practising their moves in the light from a large window.&lt;ref name=natgal/&gt;

The painting was carefully composed and shows the inspiration Degas drew from [[Japanese prints]], with figures deliberately placed off-centre or cut off at unexpected angles and the large expanse of floor which appears to tilt upwards.&lt;ref name=natgal/&gt;

==Location and provenance==
The painting ''The Dance Lesson'' is currently kept at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="nga1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/degas/index.shtm|title=The Dance Lesson by Edgar Degas|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington, D.C.|date=|year=|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its donation in 1995, the painting was part of the collection of [[Paul Mellon]], who purchased it in 1957.&lt;ref name=prov&gt;{{cite web|title=Provenance of "The Dance Lesson"|url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=93045&amp;detail=prov|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this it had been loaned to the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] in the 1920s and was loaned to a 1937 Degas exhibition in Paris by its then owner, Mrs Fiske Howard.&lt;ref name=prov/&gt;

==Relation to other paintings==
The Metropolitan Museum of Art owns a painting titled ''Dancers in the Rehearsal Room with a Double Bass'', dated 1882–85, which is possibly the second painting in the sequence.&lt;ref name="bass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/29.100.127|title=Dancers in the Rehearsal Room with a Double Bass|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=|date=|year=|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting from the sequence, ''Before the Ballet'' (1890/1892), is also in the National Gallery of Art.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dance Lesson by Edgar Degas (page 2)|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/degas/thepainting_2.shtm|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and |''Ballet Rehearsal'' (''La salle de danse'', c.1885) is in the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dance Lesson by Edgar Degas (page 5)|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/degas/thepainting_5.shtm|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When placed side by side in a frieze format, the paintings take on a decorative aspect although were not originally intended to be hung this way.&lt;ref name=5a&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dance Lesson by Edgar Degas (page 5a)|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/degas/thepainting_5a.shtm|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the 40-odd paintings collectively show how Degas examined his theory that the "intervals between figures and space were the basis for creating ornament".&lt;ref name=5a/&gt;

'''''The Frame''''' is a 1938 self-portrait by [[Frida Kahlo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fridakahlo.org/self-portrait-the-frame.jsp ]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is notable as the first work by a 20th-century Mexican artist to be purchased by a major international museum, when it was acquired by [[The Louvre]] in 1939. The painting is now shown at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fridakahlofans.com/c0255.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the only sale Kahlo made in her Paris exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Hardin  ''Frida Kahlo: A Modern Master''  2005- Page 68 1597640891 "Breton annoyed Kahlo by exhibiting a jumble of various folk objects of varying artistic merit that he had acquired in Mexico — "junk," as she called it. Nevertheless, the objects were no doubt sufficiently exotic to the European sensibility, and Breton's instincts were probably right in presenting them. While the exhibit was not a financial success (due to the imminent onset of World War II), the Louvre chose to purchase one of Kahlo's works, ''The Frame'' (c. 1938). ''The Frame'' is a lively work ...&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Garden of Pan''''' is a painting by the [[pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which was completed around 1886 and is currently housed at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/3823/ National Gallery of Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The subject of this painting was originally to form part of a piece inspired by Burne-Jones's visit to Italy in 1872.  The original had intended to depict "the beginning of the world — with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Echo and sylvan gods, and a forest full of centaurs, and a wild background of woods, mountains and rivers."&lt;ref name=wildman&gt;''Edward Burne-Jones, Victorian Artist-dreamer'' by Stephen Wildman, 1998, p266&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, at some point, decided that the subject was too large and settled on the present design in a series of sketches made in the mid-1870s.&lt;ref name=wildman /&gt;

A note in Burne-Jones's work record for 1876 states that he had started work on "the large picture of Pan in the woods", but it was not until 1886 that the picture could be said to be truly begun. The final picture was exhibited in the summer of 1887 at the Grosvenor Gallery.&lt;ref name=wildman /&gt;

The painting was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1919 as part of the [[Felton Bequest]].

'''''The Harlequin's Carnival''''' (Spanish: ''Carnaval de Arlequín'') is an [[oil painting]] rendered by [[Joan Miró]] between 1924 and 1925. It is one of the most outstanding [[Surrealism|surrealist]] paintings of the artist, and it is preserved in the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].{{sfn|Malet|1993|pp= 36-37}}

Created between 1924 and 1925, ''Harlequin’s Carnival'' is one of Joan Miró’s best-known pieces. [[Harlequin]] is the name of a well-known Italian comic theater character that is generally identified by his checkered costume. The ‘carnival’ in the title of the painting may refer to [[Mardi Gras]], the celebration that occurs before the fasting of Lent begins.

In 1924 poet [[André Breton]] formed the Surrealist movement. Around the time of the group’s formation Miró started to paint in the surrealist style. Surrealism focused on dreams and the subconscious as artistic material, and Miró was able to draw from these ideas. He painted the subconscious, but also his own life experiences and memories. To combine these two sources he draws on his imagination to create magical elements in his paintings. This can even be seen in his early work, for instance in his 1922 detailist painting ''[[The Farm (Miró)|The Farm]]''. 

This specific painting is centered on a harlequin at a carnival. Although the harlequin resembles a guitar, he still retains some of his harlequin characteristics such as a checkered costume, a mustache, an admiral’s hat, and a pipe. The harlequin in this painting is sad, which could be due to the hole in his stomach. This detail may refer to Miró’s personal life experiences, because at this point in his life he did not have much money for food and was on the brink of starvation. This is a painting of a celebration; all the characters seem to be happy due to the fact they are playing, singing, and dancing. Some of the objects in the painting are anthropomorphized, and some seem to be moving and dancing as well. One example is the ladder to the left of the painting, which has an ear and an eye (Albright-Knox Art Gallery). According to Miró, the ladder is a symbol of flight, evasion, and elevation. The green sphere to the right of the painting represents the globe because Miró, according to him, was obsessed with the idea of “conquering the world” (Albright-Knox Art Gallery). The cat in the bottom right of the painting represents Miró’s actual cat, who was always next to him as he painted. The black triangle in the window in the top right corner represents the Eiffel Tower. The painting includes many other fantastical and magical elements such as mermaids, fish out of water, dancing cats, shooting stars, a creature with wings in a box resembling a die, floating musical notes, and a floating hand. There are many strange forms and squiggly shapes that seem to be moving or floating around the canvas. The beauty of the painting is in its widespread composition; every corner of the painting seems to be filled with some object, character, or shape, which makes the entire painting come to life. 

In the international peer-reviewed journal ''[[JAMA Psychiatry]]'', James C. Harris, MD, writes that for Miró, “painting was a means to express his inner life through visionary art” (p 226). This is a reference to Miró’s style of painting, automatism, essentially painting without planning the subject or composition. In this process the artist paints whatever comes to mind, thereby painting his subconscious thoughts. Once the shapes are on the canvas, the artist is able to create images out of the forms based on his imagination. In 1931, Miró said, “I’m only interested in anonymous art, the kind that springs from the collective unconscious” (''JAMA Psychiatry''). This quote tells us a great deal about ''Harlequin's Carnival'', since it was Miró’s first surrealist painting. Through this painting Miró is trying to convey his subconscious, which inadvertently reflects on his life experiences. By analyzing this painting the viewer learns of Miró’s sadness, happiness, and creative imagination.

==History==

===Early years (1980-mid-1982)===
Formed in early 1980, the Proletariat started as a [[cover band]] playing at hardcore punk shows in the Boston area,&lt;ref name="BostonRock32"&gt;Sheena&lt;!-- Born Lisa Buchholz, former DJ at MIT's WMBR radio station, in Cambridge, Massachusetts --&gt; (September 1982).

Belligerent British-sounding American [[Lead vocalist|singer]] Richard Brown fronted the group with two friends, both former classmates of his at [[Apponequet Regional High School]]: [[guitarist]] Frank Michaels and [[bassist]] Peter Bevilacqua. The three had enrolled at [[Southeastern Massachusetts University]] together, where they studied history, finance, and industrial relations, respectively, but, after exposure to [[left-wing politics]], and despite having no previous musical experience, all dropped out of college during their senior year to form a punk band,&lt;ref&gt;Giusti, Bob (December 15–22, 1982). "The Proletariat Take the Stand". ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)#Expansion|The NewPaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which Brown would name the Proletariat.&lt;ref name="Millman, 1982"/&gt; In wanting to align themselves with the [[working class]], Brown took work as a delivery truck driver, and Bevilacqua as a supermarket clerk; Michaels, for his part, devoted himself to managing the band.&lt;ref name="Millman, 1982"/&gt;

Brown initially played [[snare drum]] standing up while he sang, until the slightly younger high-schooler Tom McKnight, who worked as a gas station attendant, completed the band as their [[drummer]] in September 1980, occasionally accompanied by Brown on [[cowbell]].&lt;ref name="BostonRock32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baylies, 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMONE_TheProletariat"&gt;Foley, Ryan.

Four songs from the Proletariat's earlier demo tape surfaced on vinyl along with 14 more songs to comprise the band's first LP, ''[[Soma Holiday (the Proletariat album)|Soma Holiday]]'', hailed by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as "the hardcore debut of 1983", even as Christgau noted their sound was not hardcore per se.&lt;ref name="Xgau"&gt;{{cite web

In 1984, the Proletariat returned to Radiobeat Studios to record another album with Dufour and Giordano, assisted by [[Josiah McElheny]].

Both the album and single showed another side of the band, including layered melodies and featuring a guest appearance by [[Roger Miller (rock musician)|Roger Miller]] of [[Mission of Burma]] playing piano on an updated version of "An Uneasy Peace", as well as Laurel Bowman's soft-toned voice in sharp contrast with Brown's staccato pronouncements.&lt;ref name="SV_VEaOAT-Rvw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KFH_TheProle"/&gt;{{sfn|Hurchalla|2016|p=208}}

'''''Things the Grandchildren Should Know''''' is an [[autobiography]] by [[Mark Oliver Everett]], the front man of the [[independent music|independent rock band]] [[Eels (band)|Eels]]. Everett spent a year writing the book&lt;ref name="dfb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/Eels,8964 |title=Eels "If you’re going to boo somebody, you better know who you’re booing, bitch."  |publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes |date=May 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the release of the retrospectives ''[[Meet The Eels: Essential Eels, Vol. 1 (1996–2006)]]'' and ''[[Useless Trinkets: B-Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996–2006]]'' and the composition of 2009's ''[[Hombre Lobo]].''

==Title==
The book shares its title with the closing track from the Eels' 2005 album ''[[Blinking Lights and Other Revelations]].'' In that song Everett takes on the [[persona]] of an elderly grandfather sharing the wisdom he has learned about life shortly before his death. The parallels between the song and the book are loose, as Everett is much younger than his song persona. He remarks in the final chapter the irony of the title given that he has no children, let alone grandchildren. The German edition's title “Glückstage in der Hölle”&lt;ref&gt;JohnDoe: [http://www.tcboyle.de/wordpress/?p=256 Mark Oliver Everett: Glückstage in der Hölle], review (German)&lt;/ref&gt; translates to "Lucky days in hell", resembling the name of the Eels' song ''[[Your Lucky Day in Hell]].''

==Marketing==
Unusually for a modern autobiography, neither inside the book nor the cover (first edition) includes photos of the author. Likewise, the cover refers to Everett's full name, rather the better-known moniker '''E'''. The front and back cover avoid referring to his status as the front man of the Eels. Readings of portions of the text occurred during live sets during the 2008 Eels tour. Eels guitarist [[Jeff Lyster|The Chet]] would later read the [[audiobook]] edition.

==Reception==
''Things the Grandchildren Should Know'' received generally positive reviews from critics from the United States—such as [[Joel Stein]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eelstheband.com/grandchildren.php |title=Eels: Official band website |publisher=[[Mark Oliver Everett]] |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as British press—including ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview9|title=Lives less ordinary|first=Claire|last=Armitstead|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/things-the-grandchildren-should-know-by-mark-oliver-everett-773529.html|title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know, By Mark Oliver Everett
|first=Charles Shaar|last=Murray|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonia Quirke]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'' claims that Everett "[P]icks the right stories to tell. A rare skill in the writers of memoirs," and sums up the book as "a subtle, touching thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article3159966.ece|title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know by Mark Oliver Everett|first=Antonia|last=Quirke|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pete Townshend]]'s cover blurb calls it "[O]ne of the best books ever written by a contemporary artist." Everett's hometown press considered it "intellectual, wry and unflinching as it conveys complex emotions with simple, graceful language."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/19/entertainment/ca-eels19 |title=Mark Everett – E of Eels – unravels why his dad was so pained |author=Geoff Boucher |publisher=''[[L.

Music]] |date=2008-11-03 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]],'' who gave it four out of five stars.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

==Publication history==
After the initial British pressing, the book was released in the United States by [[Thomas Dunne Books]] and [[St. Martin's Press]] on October 14, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-312-38513-2}}). An audio edition of this book was released on [[cassette tape]], [[CD-ROM]], and [[Compact Disc]] by [[Blackstone Audio]] on November 30, 2008. It was also made available on the [[iTunes Store]].&lt;ref name="itunes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAudiobook?id=293770120&amp;s=143444 |title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know at the iTunes Store |publisher=[[iTunes Store]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editions would go on to be published in Belgium, Denmark, Cyprus, France, Germany, Iceland, India, The Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; and Italy.

'''Trencadís'''  ({{IPA-va|tɾəŋkəˈðis}}), also known as '''pique assiette''', '''broken tile mosaics''', '''bits and pieces''', '''memoryware''', and '''shardware''', is a type of [[mosaic]] made from cemented-together tile shards and broken chinaware.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebay /&gt; Glazed china tends to be preferred, and glass is sometimes mixed in as well, as are other small materials like buttons and shells. Artists working in this form may create random designs, pictorial scenes, geometric patterns, or a hybrid of any of these.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;

Although as a folk art the method itself may be centuries old, the two most commonly used terms are both of modern origin. Trencadís, a Valencian term that means 'chopped', is the name for this method as it was revived in early 20th century [[Valencian modernism]] and [[Catalan modernism]], while pique assiette is a more general name for the technique that comes from the French language. In French, pique assiette ('plate thief') is a term for a scrounger or sponger, and thus as a name for this mosaic technique, it refers to the recycled or 'scrounged' nature of the materials.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebay /&gt;

== Technique ==
Traditional mosaics, such as classical Roman floors, are made up of individual [[tesserae]], usually small cubes that are uniformly shaped and designed for their intended use. Trencadís differs in that the tesserae are nonuniform pieces broken from tiles and chinaware originally made for other uses. Trencadís is thus a form of [[bricolage]], [[found object]] art, or recycled art.

There are two main methods for trencadís. In the first, an initial design is drawn up and the ceramic fragments are carefully fitted into the design; in this case, the mosaic is only cemented together once all of the fragments have been placed. Alternatively, an artist may spontaneously arrange fragments without a prior design; here the success of the finished work depends greatly on their improvisation skills.

== Notable artists and works ==

=== Demetrio Ribes ===

The Valencian architec Demetrio Ribes used trencadís extensively for decoration in the hall of [[Valencia's|Valencia]] [[Estació del Nord (Valencia)|North Station]] in 1907.

=== Antoni Gaudí and  Josep Maria Jujol ===
The Catalan modernist architects [[Antoni Gaudí]] and  [[Josep Maria Jujol]] used trencadís in many projects, among which [[Barcelona]]'s [[Parc Güell]] (1900–1914) is probably the most famous. Gaudí's first use of this technique was at the [[Güell Pavilions]], where the sinuous architecture forced him to break the tiles in order to cover the curved surfaces.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Gaudí tended to create patterns with his trencadís work, and he leaned towards brightly colored glazed ceramic shards. He often used discarded pieces of ceramic tile collected from the factory Pujol i Bausis located in [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], as well as pieces of white ceramic from broken cups and plates discarded by other Spanish manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Raymond Edouard Isadore ===
In France, the term pique assiette is most closely associated with Raymond Edouard Isadore (1900–1964) a French graveyard sweeper and folk artist. Starting in the late 1930s, he spent 30 years covering both the inside and outside of his house as well as his furniture and his garden walls with mosaics.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=chartres /&gt; He found his materials in the surrounding fields and quarries, in the public dump, and at auctions.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt; This habit of scavenging earned him the nickname "pique assiette" later shortened to "picassiette".&lt;ref name=chartres /&gt;

Isadore, a very religious man, created many of his mosaic scenes with Christian personages and symbols.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; He also built a "sweeper's throne" and a "sweeper's tomb" covered in pique assiette.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; As the mosaics expanded, the project became more widely known, and in 1954, [[Pablo Picasso]] visited Isadore's house.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; Today, the house is a tourist attraction near [[Chartres]] known as "Maison Picassiette".&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;

=== Watts Towers ===
{{Main|Watts Towers}}
The [[Watts Towers]] in Los Angeles were built over a period of 30 years by [[Simon Rodia]], a construction worker and tile mason. Begun in 1921, the 17 interconnected towers were decorated with fragments of porcelain, tile, glass, seashells and other found objects. Rodia built them without a premade plan, using damaged pieces from local tile companies and materials scavenged by neighborhood children.

=== Bridge of the Dragon ===
A contemporary example is the Bridge of the Dragon, which crosses the [[Guadaíra]] River at [[Alcalá de Guadaíra]].&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt; The bridge's support structure emulates a dragon's body and is covered in trencadís.&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt; Designed by engineer José Luis Manzanares, it was directly inspired by Gaudí's dragon fountain in Parc Güell.&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt;

=== Memory jugs ===
{{Main|Memory jug}}
A related form is the [[memory jug]], an American [[folk art]] form that memorializes the dead.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt; The memory jug is a vessel with a mosaic-like surface decoration of glass and ceramic shards, seashells, trinkets, coins and other small objects, especially objects associated with a specific dead person.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabler /&gt; Most known examples date back no further than the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt;

A '''vanitas''' is a symbolic work of art showing the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death, often contrasting symbols of wealth and symbols of ephemerality and death. Best-known are ''vanitas'' [[still life]]s, a common genre in [[Netherlandish art]] of the 16th and 17th centuries; they have also been created at other times and in other [[medium (art)|media]] and [[Genre#Visual arts|genres]].&lt;ref&gt;Search for 'vanitas' at Harvard Art Museums: [https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/?q=vanitas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The [[Latin]] noun [[wikt:vanitas#Latin|''vanitas'']] (from the Latin adjective ''vanus'' 'empty') means 'emptiness', 'futility', or 'worthlessness', the traditional Christian view being that earthly goods and pursuits are transient and worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=vanitas ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; It alludes to [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleref2-nb|Eccl.|1:2; 12:8|VULGATE}}, where ''vanitas'' translates the Hebrew word ''hevel'', which also includes the concept of transitoriness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Fredericks, ''Coping with Transience: Ecclesiastes on Brevity in Life'', p. 15 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Treasury of Sayings and Quotations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |first=Susan |last=Ratcliffe |date=October 13, 2011 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |location=[[Oxford]] |id={{ISBN|0-19960912-8}} |isbn=978-0-199-60912-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IYOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%226+Vanitas+vanitatum%22+futility 127]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Bonbon to Cha-cha.

==Themes==
[[File:Pier Francesco Cittadini Vanitas-Stillleben.jpg|thumb|245px|[[Pier Francesco Cittadini]] from 17th century school]]

Vanitas themes were common in medieval funerary art, with most surviving examples in sculpture. By the 15th century, these could be extremely morbid and explicit, reflecting an increased obsession with death and decay also seen in the ''[[Ars moriendi]],'' the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'', and the overlapping motif of the ''[[Memento mori]].''  From the Renaissance such motifs gradually became more indirect and, as the still-life genre became popular, found a home there.  Paintings executed in the vanitas style were meant to remind viewers of the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death. They also provided a moral justification for painting attractive objects
.

==Motifs==
[[File:Harmen Steenwijck - Vanitas.JPG|245px|thumb|left|''Vanitas'' by [[Harmen Steenwijck]]]]

Common vanitas symbols include skulls, which are a reminder of the certainty of death; rotten fruit (decay); bubbles (the brevity of life and suddenness of death); smoke, watches, and hourglasses (the brevity of life); and musical instruments (brevity and the ephemeral nature of life). Fruit, flowers and butterflies can be interpreted in the same way, and a peeled lemon was, like life, attractive to look at but bitter to taste. Art historians debate how much, and how seriously, the vanitas theme is implied in still-life paintings without explicit imagery such as a skull. As in much moralistic genre painting, the enjoyment evoked by the sensuous depiction of the subject is in a certain conflict with the moralistic message.&lt;ref&gt;For more on this topic, see [https://books.google.it/books?id=QkeBswEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+living+dead+ecclesiastes+through+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYx7rVrrDdAhXIKewKHZ9oB1MQ6AEIKTAA ''The Living Dead: Ecclesiastes through Art''], exh. cat. edited by Corinna Ricasoli, Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh 2018, and the bibliography therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Composition of flowers'' is a  less obvious style of Vanitas by [[Abraham Mignon]] in the [[National Museum, Warsaw]]. Barely visible amid vivid and perilous nature (snakes, poisonous mushrooms), a bird skeleton is a symbol of vanity and shortness of life.
