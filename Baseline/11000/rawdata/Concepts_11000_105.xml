[[Japa]] (or japam) means repeating or remembering a [[mantra]] (or mantram), and '''''ajapa-japa''''' (or '''''ajapajapam''''') means constant awareness of the [[mantra]], or of what it represents.&lt;ref name=eemh&gt;
[[Eknath Easwaran]] (1977/2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=En3YNwAACAAJ&amp;dq=mantram+handbook+easwaran Mantram handbook]'' (5th ed.). Tomales, CA: Nilgiri Press. {{ISBN|1-58638-028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati, [http://www.swamij.com/mantra-japa-ajapa.htm Mantra Japa and Ajapa-Japa], accessed 9 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter A in front of the word japa means without (it should be understood, that ajapa means "no chanting", thus ajapa means to stop thinking about anything material, and japa means to think about Paramatma, God instead of thinking of maya).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Thus, ajapa-japa is the practice of japa without the mental effort normally needed to repeat the mantra (effort is necessary for those who are not pure enough to dedicate themselves completely to God, and still have material desires, which is the cause of repeated reincarnation in samsara ocean). In other words, it has begun to come naturally, turning into a constant [[awareness]]. 

Says Swami Satchidananda: 

{{quote|"You can perform japa, repetition of a mantra or Sacred Word, in the midst of your day-to-day work. Then, when it becomes a habit, even when you are working intensely a portion of the mind will keep repeating the mantra always. That means you have locked one end of your chain to a holy place, while the rest of the chain remains still in the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;Sita Weiner, Swami Satchidananda, His Biography. 1970: Straight Arrow Books, World Publishing Company, NYC, New York, Lib. Congress # 70-141477&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the word '[[japa]]' is [[Sanskrit]], and the practice described here associated with Hinduism, the same basic practice and result is also found in other faith traditions. Examples include the [[Jesus Prayer]] practice of [[Orthodox Christianity]],

==Procedure==
{{inappropriate person|section|date=May 2009}}
The practice of constant remembrance evolves in stages:

At first, the practitioner intentionally repeat the [[syllables]] of the mantra internally, as if you are talking to yourself in your mind. You allow the inner sound to come at whatever speed feels comfortable to the mind. Sometimes it is very slow, as if the mind were wading through a vat of honey. At other times it is very fast, as if flying through the sky without restraint.

With practice, the mantra japa is repeated automatically, like a song that you have heard many times, which just comes on its own. (Some practitioners consider this automatic repeating to be the meaning of Ajapa-Japa, though there is a subtler meaning, as described below.)

Gradually, you merely remember the mantra with attention drawn to it. It is more like noticing what is already happening, rather than causing it to happen. It is somewhat like the attention stance of listening rather than speaking, though you might not literally hear the sound.

In time, the feeling of the mantra is there, even when the sound or remembering of the syllables is not there. For example, sometimes people will say, "[[Om]], Shanti, Shanti, Shanti," where the word Shanti means peace or tranquility. During the remembering of the word there may be two things—the word and the feeling of peace or tranquility. When the syllables fade away, the feeling may still be there; this is remembrance of the feeling of the mantra.

As the practice evolves, there comes a pervasive awareness of the mantra, subtler than both the syllables and any surface level meaning or definition. This constant awareness is the meaning of Ajapa-Japa of the mantra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4778">In [[set theory]], an '''amorphous set''' is an [[Cardinality#Infinite sets|infinite]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which is not the [[disjoint union]] of two infinite [[subset]]s.&lt;ref name="truss"&gt;{{citation

==Existence==
Amorphous sets cannot exist if the [[axiom of choice]] is assumed.  [[Abraham Fraenkel|Fraenkel]] constructed a permutation model of [[Urelement#Urelements in set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel with Atoms]] in which the set of atoms is an amorphous set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The axiom of choice |last=Jech |first=Thomas J. |date=2008 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0486318257 |location=Mineola, N.Y. |oclc=761390829}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cohen's initial work on forcing in 1963, proofs of the consistency of amorphous sets with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Plotkin|first=Jacob Manuel |date=November 1969|title=Generic Embeddings |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/generic-embeddings/BEC36DA66935B30C082FDFB08F31D8D3 |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |language=en |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=388–394 |doi=10.2307/2270904 |issn=0022-4812 |mr=252211|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional properties==
Every amorphous set is [[Dedekind-infinite set|Dedekind-finite]], meaning that it has no [[bijection]] to a proper subset of itself. To see this, suppose that ''S'' is a set that does have a bijection ''f'' to a proper subset. For each ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0
define ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be the set of elements that belong to the image of the ''i''-fold [[Iterated function|composition of ''f'' with itself]] but not to the image of the (''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-fold composition.
Then each ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is non-empty, so the union of the sets ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with even indices would be an infinite set whose complement is also infinite, showing that ''S'' cannot be amorphous. However, the converse is not necessarily true: it is consistent for there to exist Dedekind-finite sets that are not amorphous.&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;{{citation|last=Lévy|first=A.|title=The independence of various definitions of finiteness|url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm46/fm4611.pdf|year=1958|author-link=Azriel Lévy|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=46|pages=1–13|mr=0098671}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

No amorphous set can be [[linear ordering|linearly ordered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | mr = 0469760

In particular this is the combination of the implications Ia&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which de la Cruz et al. credit respectively to {{harvtxt|Lévy|1958}} and {{harvtxt|Truss|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the image of an amorphous set is itself either amorphous or finite, it follows that every function from an amorphous set to a linearly ordered set has only a finite image.

The [[cofinite filter]] on an amorphous set is an [[ultrafilter]]. This is because the complement of each infinite subset must not be infinite, so every subset is either finite or cofinite.

==Variations==
If π is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of an amorphous set into finite subsets, then there must be exactly one integer ''n''(π) such that π has infinitely many subsets of size ''n''; for, if every size was used finitely many times, or if more than one size was used infinitely many times, this information could be used to coarsen the partition and split π into two infinite subsets. If an amorphous set has the additional property that, for every partition π, ''n''(π)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then it is called '''strictly amorphous''' or '''strongly amorphous''', and if there is a finite upper bound on ''n''(π) then the set is called '''bounded amorphous'''. It is consistent with ZF that amorphous sets exist and are all bounded, or that they exist and are all unbounded.&lt;ref name="truss"/&gt;

'''Antifeminism''' (also spelt '''anti-feminism''') is broadly defined as opposition to some or all forms of [[feminism]]. This opposition has taken various forms across time and cultures. For example, antifeminists in the late 19th century and early 20th century resisted [[women's suffrage]], while antifeminists in the late 20th century in the [[United States]] opposed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Lynne E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVtFJ5tvINsC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1032-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddux" /&gt; Others, particularly in the 21st century, see antifeminism as a response to an ideology rooted in hostility towards men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/30/how-anti-feminism-is-shaping-world-politics/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3b1021768c79 |title= How anti-feminism is shaping world politics  |work = Washington  Post |accessdate=October 25, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/anti-feminist-youtuber-sydney-watson-launces-march-for-men-in-melbourne.html |title= 'Anti-feminist' YouTuber Sydney Watson launches March for Men in Melbourne  |work =News hub |accessdate=October 25, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K.J., Kanner, M. and Elsayegh, N. (2009), "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01491.x/abstract Are Feminists Man Haters? Feminists' and Nonfeminists' Attitudes Toward Men]", ''Psychology of Women Quarterly'', Vol. 33, pp. 216-224&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] argues that an antifeminist ideology rejects at least one of the following general principles of feminism:

#That [[sociology of gender|social arrangements]] among men and women are neither natural nor divinely determined.
#That social arrangements among men and women [[patriarchy|favor men.]]
#That there are collective actions that can and should be taken to transform these arrangements into more just and equitable arrangements, such as those in the timelines of [[timeline of women's suffrage|woman's suffrage]] and [[timeline of women's rights (other than voting)|other rights]].&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;[[Kenneth Clatterbaugh|Clatterbaugh, Kenneth]] (2007), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T54J3Q_VwnIC&amp;pg=PA21 Anti-feminism]", in {{cite book|editor-last1=Flood |editor-first1=Michael | editor-last2 = Kegan Gardiner | editor-first2 = Judith |editor-last3= Pease |editor-first3= Bob | editor-last4 = Pringle | editor-first4 = Keith | editor-link1 = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | pages = 21&amp;ndash;22 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415333436 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian sociologists Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-Déri write that antifeminist thought has primarily taken the form of an extreme version of [[masculism|masculinism]], in which "men are in crisis because of the feminization of society".&lt;ref name="Blais &amp; Dupuis-Déri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blais|first1=Melissa|last2=Francis Dupuis-Déri|first2=Francis |title=Masculinism and the antifeminist countermovement |journal=Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest |volume=11 |issue=1|pages=21&amp;ndash;39|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''antifeminist'' is also used{{By whom|date=September 2017}} to describe public female figures, some of whom (such as [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Camille Paglia]], and [[Katie Roiphe|Kate Roiphe]]) define themselves as feminists, based on their opposition to some or all elements of feminist movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Rhonda|title=Anti‐feminists as media celebrities |journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies |volume=22 |issue=3|pages=207&amp;ndash;222 |doi=10.1080/1071441000220303|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists label writers such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], [[Katie Roiphe]] and [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] with this term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Stacey | first = Judith | title = Is academic feminism an oxymoron? | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 1189&amp;ndash;1194 | doi = 10.1086/495543 | date = Summer 2000 | jstor = 3175510 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kamarck Minnich | first = Elizabeth | title = Feminist attacks on feminisms: patriarchy's prodigal daughters  | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 159&amp;ndash;175 | doi = 10.2307/3178629  | date = Spring 1998 | jstor = 3178629 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their positions regarding oppression and lines of thought within feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Jervis | editor-first1 = Lisa | editor-last2 = Zeisler | editor-first2 = Andi | title = BITCHfest : ten years of cultural criticism from the pages of Bitch magazine | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780374113438 }} (Foreword by Margaret Cho.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of antifeminism has varied across time and cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women. Some women, like those in the [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]], campaigned against women's suffrage.

Men's studies scholar [[Michael Kimmel]] defines antifeminism as "the opposition to women's equality". He says that antifeminists oppose "women's entry into the public sphere, the re-organization of the private sphere, women's control of their bodies, and women's rights generally." Kimmel further writes that antifeminist argumentation relies on "religious and cultural norms" while proponents of antifeminism advance their cause as a means of "'saving' masculinity from pollution and invasion". He argues that antifeminists consider the "traditional gender division of labor as natural and inevitable, perhaps also divinely sanctioned."&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;

== Antifeminist stances ==
Some antifeminists view feminism as a denial of innate [[Sex differences in psychology|differences between the genders]], and an attempt to reprogram people against their biological tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Jean (1996), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pfYSzwWrBbYC&amp;pg=PA10 The case for feminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Leahy | editor-first = Michael P.T. | title = The liberation debate: rights at issue | page = 10 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415116947 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminists also frequently argue that feminism, despite claiming to espouse equality, ignores rights issues unique to men. Some believe that the [[feminist movement]] has achieved its aims and now seeks higher status for women than for men via special rights and exemptions, such as female-only scholarships, affirmative action, and gender quotas.&lt;ref name="(Wattenberg, B 1994)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wattenberg | first = Ben |title=Has feminism gone too far? | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061013145104/http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm| archive-date= 13 October 2006 |url=http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm| deadurl= no |accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=MenWeb |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(Pizzey, E 1999)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Pizzey | first = Erin | author-link = Erin Pizzey |title=How the women's movement taught women to hate men | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060926183932/http://www.fathersforlife.org/pizzey/how_women_were_taught_to_hate_men.htm | archive-date= 26 September 2006 |url= http://www.fathersforlife.org/pizzey/how_women_were_taught_to_hate_men.htm | deadurl= no |publisher=Fathers for Life|year=1999 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(JSC 2006)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Shaw Crouse | first = Janice | title = What Friedan wrought | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427170136/http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/articledisplay.asp?id=10088&amp;department=BLI&amp;categoryid=dotcommentary | archive-date = 27 April 2006 | url = http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/articledisplay.asp?id=10088&amp;department=BLI&amp;categoryid=dotcommentary | publisher = Concerned Women for America | date = 7 February 2006 | accessdate = 30 September 2006 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some antifeminists have argued that feminism has resulted in changes to society's previous norms relating to sexuality, which they see as detrimental to traditional values or conservative religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Murli (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUPhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Feminism and policy approaches for gender aware development]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Desai | editor-first = Murli | title = The paradigm of international social development: ideologies, development systems and policy approaches | page = 119 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781135010256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barthalow Koch, Patricia (2004), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC&amp;pg=PA1163 Feminism and sexuality in the United States]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Francoeur | editor-first1 = Robert T. | editor-last2 = Noonan | editor-first2 = Raymond J. | title = The Continuum complete international encyclopedia of sexuality | page = 1163 | publisher = Continuum | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780199754700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaggar, Alison (1983), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xVI6ZYDkDSYC&amp;pg=PA75 Traditional Marxism and human nature]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Jaggar | editor-first = Alison | title = Feminist politics and human | page = 75 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Allanheld | location = Totowa, N.J | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780710806536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ubiquity of [[casual sex]] and the decline of marriage are mentioned as negative consequences of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kassian | first = Mary A. | title = The feminist mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781581345704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lukas | first = Carrie L. | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, MD | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these traditionalists oppose women's entry [[Women in the workforce|into the workforce]], [[Women in government|political office]], and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Busch | first = Elizabeth Kaufer | contribution = Women against liberation | editor-last1 = Busch | editor-first1 = Elizabeth Kaufer | editor-last2 = Lawler | editor-first2 = Peter Augustine | title = Democracy reconsidered | page = 242 | publisher = Lexington Books | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780739124819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminists argue that a change of women's roles is a destructive force that endangers the family, or is contrary to religious morals. For example, [[Paul Gottfried]] maintains that the change of women's roles "has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family" and contributed to a "descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos".&lt;ref name="(Gottfried, Paul 2002)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gottfried |first = Paul|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/|title=The trouble with feminism|accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=LewRockwell.com|date=21 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
[[File:Antisuffragists.jpg|thumb|American antisuffragists in the early 20th century]]

=== 19th century ===
The "women's movement" began in 1848, most famously articulated by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], asking for voting rights and many other rights, such as education, job liberties, marital and property rights, and the right to choose whether to be a mother or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]] (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Irp3sOCk5cUC&amp;pg=PA69 Backlashes then and now]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Faludi | editor-first = Susan | editor-link = Susan Faludi | title = Backlash: the undeclared war against women | page = 69 | publisher = Vintage | location = London | isbn = 9781409043447 | date = 2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, a cultural counter movement had begun. Janet Chafetz identified in a study 32 first-wave antifeminist movements, including those in the 19th century and early 20th century movements.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chafetz |first= Janet |last2= Dworkin |first2= Anthony | title = In the face of threat: organized antifeminism in comparative perspective | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;60 | doi = 10.1177/089124387001001003 | jstor = 190086 | date = March 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countermovements were in response to some women's growing demands, which were perceived as threatening to the standard way of life. Though men were not the only antifeminists, men experienced what some have called a "crisis of masculinity"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = Men's responses to feminism at the turn of the century | journal = [[Gender and Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 261&amp;ndash;283 | doi = 10.1177/089124387001003003 | jstor = 189564 | date = September 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to traditional gender roles being challenged. Men's responses to increased feminism varied. Some men even subscribed to feminist ideology, but others went the other direction and became decidedly antifeminist. The men who believed in this model cited religious models and natural law to emphasize women's need to return to the private sphere, in order to separate men and women to keep women from outwardly challenging men in public.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 19th century, one of the major focal points of antifeminism was opposition to [[women's suffrage]], which began as a grassroots movement in 1848 and spanned for 72 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dolton | first = Patricia F. | title = The alert collector: women's suffrage movement | journal = [[Reference and User Services Quarterly]] | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 31&amp;ndash;36 | doi = 10.5860/rusq.54n2.31 | date = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddux"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Maddux | first = Kristy | title = When patriots protest: the anti-suffrage discursive transformation of 1917 | journal = Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 283&amp;ndash;310 | doi = 10.1353/rap.2005.0012 | date = Fall 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. In ''Sex in Education: or, a Fair Chance for the Girls'' (1873), Harvard professor Edward Clarke predicted that if women went to college, their brains would grow bigger and heavier, and their wombs would atrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Edward H. | title = Sex in education |pages=29, 55 | publisher = Wildside Press | location = Rockville, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780809501700 }} [https://books.google.com/?id=_MceYURa3VcC Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other antifeminists opposed women's entry into the labor force, their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"&gt;[[Kenneth Clatterbaugh|Clatterbaugh, Kenneth]] (2004), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-57607-774-0 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-family movement appeared in the late 19th century, by about 1870.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = Michele | title = Women's rights and wedding bells: 19th-century pro-family rhetoric and (re)enforcement of the gender status quo| journal = [[Journal of Family Issues]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 501&amp;ndash;528 | doi = 10.1177/0192513X06297465 | date = April 2007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was intended to halt the rising divorce rate and reinforce traditional family values. The National League for the Protection of the Family, formerly known as the Divorce Reform League, took over the movement in 1881.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Henderson | first = C. R. | title = Reviews: ''The Report of the National League for the Protection of the Family'' | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | page = 705 | doi = 10.1086/210751 | date = March 1898 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Warren Dike|Samuel Dike]] was one of the founders of the League, and was considered an early expert on divorce. Through his efforts, the League garnered attention from pro-family advocates. It underwent a shift from fighting against divorce to promoting marriage and traditional family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Speaking on behalf of the League in an 1887 address to the Evangelical Alliance Conference, Samuel Dike described the ideal family as having "one man and one woman, united in wedlock, together with their children".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This movement built the foundation for many pro-family arguments in contemporary antifeminism.

=== Early 20th century ===
Women's suffrage was achieved in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. [[Anna Howard Shaw]], president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working under the influence of male forces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thurner | first = Manuela | title = "Better citizens without the ballot": American antisuffrage women and their rationale during the progressive era | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;60 | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2010.0279 | date = Spring 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arguments employed by antisuffragists at the turn of the century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.

There were two reasons antisuffragists opposed women participating in the political realm. Some argued that women were already overburdened. The majority of them, however, argued that a woman's participation in the political realm would hinder her participation in social and civic duties. If they won the right to vote, women would consequently have to align with a particular party, which would destroy her ability to be politically neutral. Antisuffragists feared this would, in fact, hinder their influence with legislative authorities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mid 20th century ===
In 1951, two journalists published ''Washington Confidential.'' The novel claimed that Communist leaders used their men and women to recruit a variety of minorities in the nation's capital, such as females, colored males, and homosexual males. The vast popularity of the book caused such a buzz that the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]] had to create a "publicity campaign to improve the image of federal employees"&lt;ref name="Storrs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Storrs | first = Landon R.Y. | title = Attacking the Washington "Femmocracy": antifeminism in the Cold War Campaign against "Communists in Government" | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–152 | doi = 10.2307/20459124 | jstor = 20459124 | date = Spring 2007  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; in hopes to save their federal employees from losing their jobs. This ploy failed once the journalists linked feminism to communism in their novel and ultimately reinforced antifeminism by implying that defending the "white, Christian, heterosexual, patriarchal family" was the only way to oppose communism.&lt;ref name=Storrs /&gt;

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ====
The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] is a perennially proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] that would grant equal rights and opportunities to every citizen of the United States, regardless of his or her sex. In 1950 and 1953, ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as "the Hayden rider", making it unacceptable to ERA supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Paul| first = Alice (November 1972 and May 1973)|title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment (''interview with Amelia R. Fry'') |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt6f59n89c&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text|website=cdlib.org|publisher=Suffragists Oral History Project, University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Freeman | first = Jo|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/eraname.htm|title=What's in a Name? Does it matter how the Equal Rights Amendment is worded?|website=jofreeman.com | date = June 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hayden rider was included to keep special protections for women. A new section to the ERA was added, stating: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." That is, women could keep their existing and future special protections that men did not have. By 1972, the amendment was supported by both major parties and was immensely popular. However, it was defeated in Congress when it failed to get the vote of thirty-eight legislatures by 1982.&lt;ref name="Burris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Burris | first = Val | title = Who opposed the ERA? An analysis of the social bases of antifeminism | journal = [[Social Science Quarterly]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;317 | date = June 1983 | jstor = 42874034 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of an unaltered ERA rejected the Hayden rider, believing an ERA containing the rider did not provide for equality.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Cynthia Ellen (1989), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXlSB6-WpKUC&amp;pg=PA31 "Reasonable distinctions": an alternative to the ERA]", in {{cite book |editor-last= Harrison | editor-first = Cynthia Ellen|title= On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945–1968 |publisher=University of California Press| location = Berkeley|pages=31&amp;ndash;32|isbn=9780520061217| year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Himmelstein identified two main theories about the appeal of antifeminism and its role in opposition to the ERA. One theory is that it was a clash between upper-class liberal voters and the older, more conservative lower-class rural voters who often serve as the center for right-wing movements; in other words, this theory identifies particular social classes as more inherently friendly to antifeminism. Another theory holds that women who feel vulnerable and dependent on men are likely to oppose anything that threatens that tenuous stability; under this view, while educated, independent career women may support feminism, housewives who lack such resources are more drawn to antifeminism. Himmelstein, however, says both views are at least partially wrong, arguing that the primary dividing line between feminists and antifeminists is cultural rather than stemming from differences in economic and social status.&lt;ref name=Himmelstein&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Himmelstein | first = Jerome | title = The social basis of antifeminism: Religious networks and culture | journal = [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;15 | doi = 10.2307/1386059 | jstor = 1386059 | date = March 1986 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, in fact, similarities between income between activists on both sides of the ERA debate. As it turned out, the most indicative factors when predicting ERA position, especially among women, were race, marital status, age, and education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marshall | first = Susan E. | title = Who speaks for American Women? The future of antifeminism | journal = [[The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | volume = 515 | issue = 1 | pages = 50&amp;ndash;62 | doi = 10.1177/0002716291515001005 | jstor = 1046927 | date = May 1991 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERA opposition was much higher among white, married, older, and less educated citizens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women who opposed the ERA tended to fit characteristics consistent with the Religious Right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brady|first=David W. |last2=Tedin|first2=Kent L. |title= Ladies in pink: religion and political ideology in the anti-ERA movement | journal = [[Social Science Quarterly]] | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 564&amp;ndash;575 | date = March 1976 | jstor = 42860411 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Val Burris, meanwhile, says that high-income men opposed the amendment because they would gain the least with it being passed; that those men had the most to lose, since the ratification of the ERA would mean more competition for their jobs and possibly a lowered self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Burris /&gt; Because of the support of antifeminism from conservatives and the constant "conservative reactions to liberal social politics", such as the New Deal attacks, the attack on the ERA has been called a "right-wing backlash".&lt;ref name=Burris /&gt; Their methods include actions such as "insults proffered in emails or on the telephone, systematic denigration of feminism in the media, Internet disclosure of confidential information (e.g. addresses) on resources for battered women"&lt;ref name="Blais &amp; Dupuis-Déri" /&gt; and more.

==== Abortion ====
Abortion remains one of the most controversial topics in the United States. ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was passed in 1973, and abortion was utilized by many antifeminists to rally supporters. [[Anti-abortion movements|Antiabortion views]] helped further several right-wing movements, including explicit antifeminism, and helped right-wing politicians rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollack Petchesky|first=Rosalind | title = Antiabortion, antifeminism, and the rise of the new right | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 206&amp;ndash;246 | doi = 10.2307/3177522| date = Summer 1981 | ref = harv | postscript = .|jstor=3177522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joffe|first=Carole|title=Abortion and antifeminism|journal= [[Politics &amp; Society]] | volume=15|issue=2|pages=207&amp;ndash;211 |doi=10.1177/003232928701500206 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiabortion writings, as well as conservative commentary in the late 20th century criticized the selfishness and self-centeredness of the feminist movement regarding abortions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Some current antifeminist practices can be traced back to the rise of the religious right in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  [[BBC]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', among others, have covered the 2014 social media trend [[Women Against Feminism|#WomenAgainstFeminism]].

British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the website [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] have also reported on an increasing number of women and female celebrities rejecting feminism and instead subscribing to [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardy |first1=Elle |last2=Lehmann |first2=Claire |last3=Jha |first3=Trisha |last4=Matthewson |first4=Paula |title=Am I a feminist?

In response to the social media trend, modern day feminists also began to upload similar pictures to websites such as Twitter and Tumblr.

[[File:STOP ERA.gif|thumb|Symbol used for signs and buttons by ERA opponents]]

Founded in the U.S. by [[Phyllis Schlafly]] in 1972, Stop ERA, now known as "[[Eagle Forum]]", lobbied successfully to block the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name="wse2"&gt;Tierney, Helen (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DkPFL6XcKeQC&amp;pg=PA95 Antifeminist movements]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tierney | editor-first = Helen | title = Women's studies encyclopedia: A–F | page=95 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780861721122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Schlafly who forged links between Stop ERA and other conservative organizations, as well as single-issue groups against abortion, pornography, gun control, and unions. By integrating Stop ERA with the thus-dubbed "[[new right]]", she was able to leverage a wider range of technological, organizational and political resources, successfully targeting pro-feminist candidates for defeat.&lt;ref name="wse2" /&gt;

In India, the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]] is an antifeminist organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basu | first = Srimati | title = Playing off courts: the negotiation of divorce and violence in plural legal settings in Kolkata | journal = [[Journal of Legal Pluralism|The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law]] | volume = 38 | issue = 52 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;75 | doi = 10.1080/07329113.2006.10756591 | date = 2006 | ref = harv | postscript = .| citeseerx = 10.1.1.485.7052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opposed to a number of laws that they claim to have been used against men.&lt;ref&gt;Kulkarni, Mangesh (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FAxWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 Critical masculinity studies in India]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Dasgupta | editor-first1 = Rohit K. | editor-last2 = Gokulsing | editor-first2 = K.

The [[Concerned Women for America|Concerned Women of America (CWA)]] are also an antifeminist organization. Like other conservative women's groups, they oppose [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and make appeals for maternalism and biological differences between women and men.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schreiber | first = Ronnee | title = Righting feminism: conservative women and American politics | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195331813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiber|first=Ronnee | title = Injecting a woman's voice: Conservative women's organizations, gender consciousness, and the expression of women's policy preferences | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 47 | issue = 7&amp;ndash;8 | pages = 331&amp;ndash;341 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021479030885 | date = October 2002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Women's Forum]] (IWF) is another antifeminist, conservative, women-oriented group. It's younger and less established than the CWA, though the two organizations are often discussed in relation to each other. It was founded to take on the "old feminist establishment".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both of these organizations pride themselves on rallying women who do not identify with [[feminist rhetoric]] together. These organizations frame themselves as being by women, for women, in order to fight the idea that feminism is the only women-oriented ideology. These organizations chastise feminists for presuming to universally speak for all women. The IWF claims to be "the voice of ''reasonable'' women with important ideas who embrace common sense over divisive ideology".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[alt-right]] movement is antifeminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Liam|title=Alt-right, alt-left, antifa: a glossary of extremist language|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/alt-left-alt-right-glossary.html|date=15 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date = 26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
According to [[Amherst College]] sociology professor Jerome L. Himmelstein, antifeminism is rooted in social stigmas against feminism and is thus a purely reactionary movement. Himmelstein identifies two prevailing theories that seek to explain the origins of antifeminism: the first theory, proposed by Himmelstein, is that conservative opposition in the [[abortion]] and [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) debates has created a climate of hostility toward the entire feminist movement.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein" /&gt; The second theory Himmelstein identifies states that the female antifeminists who lead the movement are largely married, low education, and low personal income women who embody the "insecure housewife scenario" and seek to perpetuate their own situation in which women depend on men for fiscal support. However, numerous studies have failed to correlate the aforementioned demographic factors with support for antifeminism, and only religiosity correlates positively with antifeminist alignment.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein" /&gt; Thus, Himmelstein concludes that antifeminism is a conservative religious reaction against the progress of modern feminism.

Authors Janet Saltzman Chafetz and Anthony Gary Dworkin, writing for ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]'', argue that the organizations most likely to formally organize against feminism are religious. This is because women's movements may demand access to male-dominated positions within the religious sector, like the clergy, and women's movements threaten male-oriented values of some religions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The more successful a feminist movement is in challenging the authority of male-dominated groups, the more these groups will organize a countermovement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] sociology professor Danielle Giffort argues that the stigma against feminism created by antifeminists has resulted in organizations that practice "implicit feminism", which she defines as the "strategy practiced by feminist activists within organizations that are operating in an anti- and [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] environment in which they conceal feminist identities and ideas while emphasizing the more socially acceptable angles of their efforts".&lt;ref name=Giffort&gt;{{cite journal | last = Giffort | first = Danielle M. | title = Show or tell? Feminist dilemmas and implicit feminism at girls' rock camp | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 569–588 | doi = 10.1177/0891243211415978 | jstor = 23044173 | date = October 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the stigma against feminism, some activists, such as those involved with [[Rock and Roll Camp for Girls|Girls Rock]], may take the principles of feminism as a foundation of thought and teach girls and women independence and self-reliance without explicitly labeling it with the stigmatized brand of feminism. Thus, most women continue to practice feminism in terms of seeking equality and independence for women, yet avoid the label.&lt;ref name=Giffort /&gt;

==Motivations==
Antifeminism might be motivated by the belief that feminist theories of [[patriarchy]] and disadvantages suffered by women in society are incorrect or exaggerated;&lt;ref name="flood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; that feminism as a movement encourages [[misandry]] and results in harm or oppression of men; or driven by general opposition towards [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blee, Kathleen M. (1998), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d9lhBw8t410C&amp;pg=PA32 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Mankiller | editor-first1 = Wilma | editor-last2 = et al | title = The reader's companion to U.S. women's history | page = 32 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Co | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780395671733 }}
*"The two major waves of antifeminist activity coincide with the two waves of the women's rights movement: the campaign to secure female suffrage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the feminist movement of the late twentieth century. In both periods, those holding a traditional view of women's place in the home and family tried to advance their cause by joining with other conservative groups to forestall efforts to extend women's rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mertz, Thomas J. (2005), "[https://archive.org/stream/NewDictionaryOfTheHistoryOfIdeas/New%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20History%20of%20Ideas%202005_djvu.txt Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cline Horowitz | editor-first = Maryanne | title = New dictionary of the history of ideas / Vol. 1, Abolitionism to Common sense | pages = 94&amp;ndash;98 | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780684313788 }}
*"Antifeminism, then, repudiates critiques of male supremacy and resists efforts to eliminate it (often accompanied by dismissal of the idea that change is possible). Note that this definition of antifeminism limits its reference to reactions against critiques of gender-based hierarchies and efforts to relieve the oppression of women."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Angela Marie (2008), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA115 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Bonnie G. | title = The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history / Vol. 1, Abayomi to Czech Republic | pages = 115&amp;ndash;119 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | isbn = 9780195148909 | year = 2008 }}
*"Reform activity that challenged either the subordination of women to men or the patriarchal limitation of women's status provoked an antifeminist response that included an intellectual and political campaign to halt progress toward women's rights and equality."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 126 American students, antifeminist men were found to value their own power more than nonfeminist or feminist men did. Antifeminist women were not found to have the same difference from other women, suggesting some men may oppose feminism because they fear losing their power or sense of power in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first= Lori J. |last2=Shanahan |first2=Sandra B. |last3=Olivetti |first3=Jennifer | title = Power, empowerment, and equality: evidence for the motives of feminists, nonfeminists, and antifeminists | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 37 | issue = 3&amp;ndash;4 | pages = 227&amp;ndash;247 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025699828057 | date = August 1997 | ref = harv | quote = "Men may focus on feminism as an issue of power simply because of the position they have traditionally held in society.

== Overview ==
Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of [[living system]]s in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems.  These topics are broad, but often include [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary dynamics]], [[Emergence|emergent properties of collective systems]], [[Biomimetics|biomimicry]], as well as related issues about the [[Philosophy of biology|philosophy of the nature of life]] and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.

== Philosophy ==

The modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only "life-as-we-know-it" but also "life-as-it-might-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Langton, C. G. 1992. [http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf Artificial Life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225322/http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf |date=March 11, 2007 }}. Addison-Wesley. ., section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.

Vladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of "processes-as-we-know-them" and "processes-as-they-could-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Red'ko, V. G. 1999. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MATHME.html Mathematical Modeling of Evolution]. in: F. Heylighen, C. Joslyn and V. Turchin (editors): Principia Cybernetica Web (Principia Cybernetica, Brussels). For the importance of ALife modeling from a cosmic perspective, see also Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death, ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) p. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the commonly accepted [[Life#Definitions|definition of life]] does not consider any current alife simulations or [[software]] to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any [[ecosystem]]. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:

* The ''strong alife'' (cf. [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|Strong AI]]) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" ([[John von Neumann]]) {{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=There seems to be no original source for this quote, and in fact if you restrict a web search to pages that don't contain the phrase artificial life, there are only a handful left.}}. Notably, [[Thomas S. Ray|Tom Ray]] declared that his program [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas S. Ray|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=C. C.|editor2-last=Farmer|editor2-first=J. D.|editor3-last=Rasmussen|editor3-first=S|title=An approach to the synthesis of life|journal=Artificial Life II, Santa Fe Institute Studies in the Sciences of Complexity|date=1991|volume=XI|pages=371–408|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Redwood City, CA|language=English|quote=The intent of this work is to synthesize rather than simulate life.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711051305/http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|archivedate=2015-07-11|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''weak alife'' position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.

== Organizations ==
{{Main|Artificial life organizations}}

==Software-based ("soft")==

=== Techniques ===
*[[cellular automaton|Cellular automata]] were used in the early days of artificial life, and are still often used for ease of [[scalability]] and [[parallelization]].  Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.
*[[Artificial neural network]]s are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent.  Although traditionally more of an [[artificial intelligence]] technique, neural nets can be important for simulating [[population dynamics]] of organisms that can ''learn''.  The symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity, as in, for instance, the [[Baldwin effect]].

=== Notable simulators ===

====Program-based====
{{Further|programming game}}
Program-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually [[Turing complete]].  This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA.  Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism "lives" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing [[self-replication]]. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of [[cellular automata]] is common but not required. Another example could be an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent system/program]].

====Module-based====
Individual modules are added to a creature.  These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion).  Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.

====Parameter-based====
Organisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate.  That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other ''finite'' parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.

====Neural net–based====
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative.  Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers  use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

==Hardware-based ("hard")==
{{Further|Robot}}
Hardware-based artificial life mainly consist of ''robots'', that is, [[automation|automatically]] guided [[machine]]s able to do tasks on their own.

==Biochemical-based ("wet")==
{{Further|Synthetic biology}}
Biochemical-based life is studied in the field of [[synthetic biology]]. It involves e.g. the creation of [[synthetic DNA]]. The term "wet" is an extension of the term "[[wetware (brain)|wetware]]".

Proposed by [[Roy John Britten]] and [[Eric H. Davidson]] in 1969, the model postulates four classes of [[DNA]] sequence: an integrator gene, a producer gene, a receptor site, and a sensor site. The sensor site regulates the integrator gene, responsible for synthesis of activator RNA. The integrator gene cannot synthesize activator RNA unless the sensor site is activated. Activation and deactivation of the sensor site is done by external stimuli, such as hormones. The activator RNA then binds with a nearby receptor site, which stimulates the synthesis of [[mRNA]] at the [[structural gene]].

This theory would explain how several different integrators could be synthesized at the same time. In addition, this theory would explain the pattern of [[repetitive DNA]] sequences followed by a unique [[DNA]] sequence that exists in [[gene]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Genetics Classical to Modern| last=Gupta| first=P.K.| publisher=Rastogi Publications| year=2007| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{Lang|la|Castigat ridendo mores}}''' ({{IPA-la|kaˈstiːɡat rɪˈdɛndoː ˈmoːreːs}}) (laughing corrects morals) is a Latin phrase that generally means "one corrects customs by laughing at them," or "he corrects morals by ridicule."&lt;ref name=Latin-Quotes&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin Quotes: Criticism|url=http://latin-phrases.co.uk/quotes/criticism/|work=Latin Phrases &amp; Quotes|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators suggest that the phrase embodies the essence of satire; in other words, the best way to change things is to point out their absurdity and laugh at them.&lt;ref name=Commentators&gt;{{cite web|last=Felt|first=Scott|title=Latin Phrases in Scholarly Writing|url=http://pacs.unt.edu/criminal-justice/content/latin-phrases-scholarly-writing|publisher=University of North Texas, Department of Criminal Justice|accessdate=July 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104034723/http://pacs.unt.edu/criminal-justice/content/latin-phrases-scholarly-writing|archivedate=November 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[New Latin]] [[poet]] Abbé {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean de Santeul|fr}} (1630–1697) allegedly coined the phrase.&lt;ref name=Santeul&gt;{{cite web|title=Castigat ridendo mores.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50459">'''Child migration''' or "children in migration or mobility" (sometimes more generally "children on the move"&lt;ref name="Child Labour p. 30"&gt;{{cite book | title=Migrant Children in Child Labour, A vulnerable group in need of attention, International Organisation of Migration, Children on the Move |author1=Van de Glind, Hans  |author2=Anne Kou | year=2013 | pages=27–43, p. 30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the movement of people ages 3–18 within or across political borders, with or [[Unaccompanied minor|without their parents]] or a [[legal guardian]], to another country or region. They may travel with or without legal [[travel documents]]. They may arrive to the destination country as [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]], or [[economic migrants]].

== Reasons for migration ==
The motivations for children to migrate are as diverse as the individuals who migrate. They include economic reasons, educational aspirations, reasons related to gender or culture, personal motivations as well as emergencies, natural disasters, persecution and humanitarian crises. Some children leave in search of better opportunities while others escape violence, exploitation, abuse or conflict. Multiple reasons often coincide. When parents migrate or separate, children may move to another place or country with one or both parents, or they might be left behind by their parents and are then indirectly affected by migration.&lt;ref name="Child Labour p. 30"/&gt;

== Rights of children in migration and mobility ==

=== The right to be heard ===
The right to be heard is a child rights principle as defined by the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. According to Article 12 of the Convention, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them, and their views have to be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. This right applies equally to children’s participation in social and political matters as well as in judicial and administrative proceedings. As a general principle, the child’s right to be heard reflects the concept of children's ‘agency’, viewing children not only as vulnerable persons in need of special protection, but also as informed decision makers, rights holders and active members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Heart of the Matter, Assessing credibility when children apply for asylum in the European Union | publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association | author=Crawley, Heaven | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many children are reluctant to share information with the authorities in the country of destination due to fears that disclosing information might not be in their interest and that telling their story might lead to being returned to their country of origin. Children might have been instructed by third persons to reveal only certain parts of their story, there might be threats and fears of reprisals involved, and the child might not trust the police and local authorities will be able to protect them. A reception system that demonstrates respect and upholds the dignity of the child can achieve to foster a sense of trust in the child towards the officials and professionals whom she or he meets with. Interpreters might influence the information gathering process in asylum procedures and criminal investigations as they affect how the child’s story is being understood and perceived. Inaccurate translation might compromise the child’s statement, leading to decisions on the basis of incorrect information. This relates not only to the content translated but also to the style and semantic choices made by the child and how the interpreters convey the message.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Heaven, Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Best interests’ assessment and determination ===
[[Best interests]] is defined in Article 3 of the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which says that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”. Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance “all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47 | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the child to have her or his best interests taken as a primary consideration means that the child’s interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations. The assessment is specific to the child as an individual, making it important to establish a trust-based relationship with the child and to communicate effectively in a language that the girl or boy understands. The assessments ideally involves a multi-disciplinary team of qualified professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children’s Fund, Safe and Sound, What States can do to ensure respect for the best interests of [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied and separated children]] in Europe, 2014. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best Interests of the Child, 2006. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk and resilience assessments are a central component of the best interests’ determination process because they consider the context of the countries of destination and origin and also how the risks and resiliency of the child will change on the basis of any decision taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Conclusion on Children at Risk, Executive Committee Conclusions, No. 107(LVIII), 5 October 2007. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In transnational cases, a comprehensive best interests’ assessment and determination process considers the following:

* Establishing the child’s identity and the identity of any accompanying persons and the quality of their relations
* Case assessment, including the following components: 
** Hearing the child 
** Assessment of the child’s situation, background and needs 
** Social situation and family assessment
** Gathering evidence including through forensic examinations and interviews with the child 
** Risk and security assessments
** Mapping sources of support, skills, potentials and resources for empowerment 
* Developing a life project 
* Comprehensive child impact assessment of any potential decisions 
* Identification of a durable solution 
* Continued assessments during the implementation of the durable solution with due follow-up, review and monitoring, and adjustments to the durable solution arrangements, if and as required, according to the best interests of the child

In the country of Ghana, there is a topic focused on the education comparison between migrant and non-migrant students. It is shown that the non-migrant students received more attention, and therefore, scored higher than the migrant students. More attention needs to be shown to the migrants just as much as its shown to all the other students. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamanja|first1=Emmanuel|title=Child Migration and Academic Performance: The Case of Basic Education in Ghana|website=eric.ed.gov |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1103112|publisher=Tamanja, Emmanuel Makabu J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to non-discrimination: Status, access and jurisdiction ===
The Convention on the Rights of the Child affords a broad protection from discrimination and the essential and equal inalienable rights afforded to all human beings. It  stipulates that States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child’s or his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] Article 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights afforded under the Convention apply to non-national children, regardless of their immigration status or the migration status of their parents. This includes children who are visiting, refugees, children of migrant workers and undocumented children. The right to non-discrimination entitles each child to immediate assistance and support while the situation of the child and her or his best interests are being assessed. Non-discrimination does not imply that a child is granted an automatic permit of stay, but that a decision is taken on the basis of the [[best interests]]’ determination, whether a child shall be [[Repatriation#Difference between repatriation and return|returned]] or whether the country of destination assumes jurisdiction over the child.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Tackling Multiple Discrimination: Practices, Policies and Laws, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Handbook on European Non-discrimination Law, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While assessing the child’s case and situation, state authorities have a responsibility to clarify which state has the jurisdiction over a child and, if required and appropriate, transfer or establish jurisdiction in the country of destination. When jurisdiction over a non-national child remains unclear, the child risks staying in a state of uncertainty and might benefit only from temporary services and protection measures, until the child’s status is fully regularised or the child returns to the country holding jurisdiction. Common factors that affect jurisdiction include: 
* There could be a case pending at court in which the child is involved, 
* Social services in another country may have been monitoring the child and her or his family; 
* The child’s situation may have been under law enforcement investigations in another country, including where child trafficking is suspected;
* The child may have handed in an asylum application in another country; 
* The child may be registered as a ‘missing child’ abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Conference on Private International Law, Practical Handbook on the Operation of the 1996 Child Protection Convention, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
The rights of the child to life, survival and development is afforded under Article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These rights are recognized by

States and are related to survival, security and health as a precondition for physical development as well as the mental, spiritual, moral, intellectual, cognitive, emotional and sociology-cultural development of the child. This is in effort to ensure the maximum survival, growth and potential of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-deportation Monitoring pp68-69"&gt;{{cite web | title=Podeszfa, Leana and Friederike Vetter, Post-deportation Monitoring: Why, how and by whom?, University of Oxford, Refugee Study Centre, Forced Migration Review, Detention, alternatives to detention and deportation, Issue 44, September 2013, pp. 68-69, p. 68. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Between a rock and a hard place"&gt;{{cite web | title=Refugee Council, ‘Between a rock and a hard place: the dilemma facing refused asylum seekers’, December 2012. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of care has a direct effect on a child's development. Promoting the child’s developmental rights and needs means enabling her to grow up in her family of origin or in a family-based or family-like alternative care placement, wherever this is in the best interests of the child. The care arrangements and access to quality services for health and education are important when assessing the child’s developmental needs.&lt;ref name="Post-deportation Monitoring pp68-69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Between a rock and a hard place"/&gt;

The following factors are relevant when assessing the development needs of a child (with reference to the relevant articles under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child):
* The right to preserve her or his identity, including nationality, name and family relations (Article 8);
* The continuity in the child's care and upbringing, with due regard to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background (Article 20); 
* The right of the child to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health (Article 24); 
* The right of every child to a standard of living adequate to the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development (Article 27);  
* Access to education (Articles 28 and 29);  
* The right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to her or his age (Article 31).

=== Access to justice ===

==== Children and justice in transnational cases ====
Children on the move sometimes are affected by or are in conflict with the law, including with cross-border family disputes and matters of parental responsibility and contact, as asylum seekers or victims of crime and, in some cases, as children who are in conflict with the law for immigration matters or for illegal and criminal matters. Some children in conflict with the law are actually victims of crime. International and European law provide for clear standards regulating the treatment, rights and entitlement of children in contact with the judiciary, as victims, defendants or perpetrators of crime.

==== Child victims of crime ====
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the exploitation of children in any form and in any context (Articles 19, 32-36). Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse can be considered a victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation should be identified as being at risk and referred to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm.

==== Children exploited in illegal and criminal activities ====
An important safeguard for child victims of crime is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims. The non-punishment clause protects children who are exploited in illegal or criminal activities and child victims of exploitation and/or trafficking who were forced to enter a country without valid travel documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 2005. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime emphasis that “children who are victims and witnesses may suffer additional hardship if mistakenly viewed as offenders when they are in fact victims and witnesses.”  The Guidelines say child victims should be protected from prosecution irrespective of any form of ‘consent’ or their active involvement in an offence and irrespective of the child’s age in relation to national laws defining the age of criminal liability. A child victim should be considered and treated as such “... regardless of their role in the offence or in the prosecution of the alleged offender or groups of offenders”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005, par. 7e. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking and the UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking reiterate the right to non-criminalisation specifically in relation to the situation of victims of trafficking who are to be protected from criminal liability for “any criminal offence that was a direct result from being trafficked”.  This provision is further strengthened by the non-punishment clause of the 2011 EU Anti-trafficking Directive and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and is therefore made binding upon States Parties: “Each Party shall, in accordance with the basic principles of its legal system, provide for the possibility of not imposing penalties on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities, to the extent that they have been compelled to do so.” (Article 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, United Nations Children’s Fund, Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Child-Friendly Version, 2009. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, United Nations Children’s Fund, Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Model Law and Related Commentary, 2009. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a non-national child is in conflict with the law and there are no indications that the child has been exploited in illegal activities or has otherwise been victimized, the same standards of juvenile justice applies to national children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Economic and Social Council, E/2002/68/Add.1, 20 May 2002. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Children’s Fund, Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, UNICEF Technical Notes, 2006. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=European Council of Refugees and Exiles, Right to Justice: Quality Legal Assistance for Unaccompanied Children, Annex 1: Guiding principles for quality legal assistance for unaccompanied children, 2014. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to consular assistance===
Children who are outside of their country of residence have a right to assistance by embassies and consular offices representing their country. Consular staff can play an important role in supporting and assisting children abroad, establishing supportive contacts and referral, and mobilizing help. Consular staff may contact central authorities or national contact points for technical advice in cases involving children. Under the 1963 [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]] of the United Nations, consular functions include helping and assisting nationals of the sending state. This could involve measures to safeguard the interests of children who are nationals of the sending State within the limits imposed by the laws and regulations of the receiving State, particularly when a guardian needs to be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on Consular Relations Article 5e and h&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities of the country of destination must inform the competent consular office without delay when the appointment of a guardian for a child is considered. The laws and regulations of the receiving State concerning the appointment of a guardian apply and are not affected by the information sharing with the relevant consular offices.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on Consular Relations Article 37b&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration and mobility within the European Union ===
All individuals, including parents, families with children and [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]], enjoy freedom of movement within the European area. In the European area of freedom of movement, citizens of EU Member States and the EFTA States Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland are entitled to enter and reside in other EU Member States for a period of up to three months without registration and are granted a permit to stay when they can demonstrate an income. The rights of children as unaccompanied migrants in the European area of freedom of movement are not explicitly defined and the related institutional responsibilities remain unclear. The way that national governments interpret and regulate the rules of freedom of movement for unaccompanied children under 18 years of age differs among the countries.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asylum  ===
The UN [[Refugee convention|UN Refugee Convention]] and its Protocol regulate the right of persons to seek international protection. Children enjoy special safeguards and have a right to have their asylum application examined individually. Child-specific grounds of persecution need to be considered irrespective of whether the child applies alone or together with a parent or caregiver. The European Union Member States have re-elaborated these standards for the EU context and have adopted [[List of international and European law on child protection and migration|a series of Directives]] regulating the qualification and reception conditions of asylum seekers in the EU as well as asylum procedures and matters of return.

==Vulnerability==
Children on the move are routinely referred to as ‘vulnerable’ although the meaning of the term has not been defined or clarified for the child protection context. Vulnerability is often understood as a deficit and equated with weakness and a need of protection. From a child rights-based approach, vulnerability refers to the limited chances of a child to fully exercise her or his rights as afforded under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name="CARDET 2013"&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees 2007"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Conclusion on Children at Risk, Executive Committee Conclusions, No. 107(LVIII), 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Existing definitions of vulnerability that are in use in the context of poverty reduction, health and nutrition can be useful in the child protection context.

== Safe migration ==
Some children migrate well-protected and cared for and some succeed to achieve the goals that motivated their journeys. When migration is safe and successful, children have opportunities to increase their well-being, to access higher-quality services and to benefit from better education. Safe migration opportunities can support children significantly in their transition into adulthood and an independent life. They will have improved life chances, including in their transition into adulthood and the labor market, with better working conditions, higher salaries and an increased potential to contribute proactively to their communities and societies, in countries of origin and destination. Children and young adults might support their families through remittances and support the development of their communities of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Relief Services, Child Migration, The Detention and repatriation of unaccompanied Central American children from Mexico, Research Study, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inter-Agency Group on Children on the Move, Why Children Matter, Experiences and lessons learnt from interventions to protect children on the move, The High Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Side Event to the 46th Session of the Commission on Population and Development: “New Trends in Migration: Demographic Aspects”, 24 April 2013, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, United Nations Children’s Fund, Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, Children and International Migration in Latin America and the Caribbean, Challenges, Newsletter on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals from a child rights perspective, Number 11, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks for children in migration ==
For children who migrate to escape difficult living situations, violence or conflict, migration can constitute an opportunity to reduce risks. Others encounter more severe risks during migration or at the place of destination. Some groups of children are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, including trafficking, because of weak social safety nets. The risks a child is exposed to are often closely intertwined and are considered cumulative. A child who is already living in a vulnerable situation, such as poverty, abuse or school-drop out, is considered even more vulnerable when additional risks come in, such as exploitative relationships or risky migration.&lt;ref name="CARDET 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees 2007"/&gt;

Many child migrants are exposed to harm during the journey and at destination. Children face violence, exploitation and abuse at the hands of people they encounter in transit and at destination, including employers, transporters, smugglers and traffickers. They might experience significant levels of indifference or abuse by state officials, including police, border guards, immigration officials and staff in reception or detention facilities. Some migrants die on the journey from dehydration, malnourishment, suffocation or transportation accidents or drown at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Relief Services, Child Migration, The Detention and repatriation of unaccompanied Central American children from Mexico, Research Study, 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsafe migration conditions, by their nature, create risks for children. In addition to experiencing acts of violence, children risk to come into conflict with the law if they travel without the required documents, if they engage in illegal or criminal activities to make a living, or if they are persuaded or forced by others to do so. In situations of habitual mobility or circular migration, such conditions can influence the well-being, safety and development significantly of the child.&lt;ref name="CARDET 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees 2007"/&gt;

===Exploitation===
Children on the move are at risk of different forms of exploitation. They include [[sexual exploitation]] in [[prostitution]] and [[pornography]], traveling sex offenders through web-cams, child abuse images and illegal content on the internet. Exploitation takes place in [[child labour]] and domestic work, as au-pairs, in factories, construction, asphalt laying, restaurants and cleaning industries, agriculture and berry picking and in begging. There are also transnational cases of early and [[forced marriage]] of children. The exploitation of children could be organised by families, small groups or large-scale criminal networks. Children are exploited also in illegal and criminal activities, including in drug production and drug trafficking, pick-pocketing or burglary.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in Europe, A broad vision to put children first, Innocenti Insight, 2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in the Nordic Countries, Rethinking strategies and national responses, A Technical Report, 2012, pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Child trafficking|Child victims of trafficking]] are also increasingly used by traffickers for purposes such as begging, benefit fraud, identity fraud, credit fraud and insurance fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Europol, The THB Financial Business Model, Assessing the current state of knowledge, 2015, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking===
[[Child trafficking]] is defined in the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|UN Trafficking Protocol of 2000]] as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation. While this definition applies only to transnational cases and/or cases involving organized criminal groups, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O, UNICEF, and UN.GIFT|title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation – Textbook 1: Understanding Child Trafficking|year=2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/Textbook_1.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Labour Organization expands definition to include movement and exploitation as key aspects of child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

Victims of transnational trafficking might cross borders with or without legal travel documents and with or without the assistance of smugglers. Persons are often recruited into trafficking only after they have crossed an international border. In many cases, trafficking takes place within countries and there are no border crossings involved. The UN Trafficking Protocol of 2000 considers the means of trafficking and the consent of the child to any of the trafficking acts as irrelevant in the identification of a trafficking victim. Forms of exploitation that could constitute trafficking include, “at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”.&lt;ref&gt;UN Trafficking Protocol, Article 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Child trafficking can be prosecuted when it is possible to prove the intent to exploit the child, even when exploitation has not yet taken place. Varying interpretations sometimes make it difficult to distinguish child trafficking from other types of exploitation.

====Definitions of child trafficking in Europe====
The Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005) adopted the international definition, identical in wording, underlining however that victims shall be protected also in cases where trafficking takes place within countries and without the involvement of large-scale organised crime groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/fr/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Anti-Trafficking Directive (2011) broadened the notion of exploitation in the trafficking concept. It explicitly includes the purpose of exploitation in criminal activities as part of the definition of human trafficking. Article 2.3 clarifies that the “‘exploitation of criminal activities’ should be understood as the exploitation of a person to commit, inter alia, pick-pocketing, shop-lifting, drug trafficking and other similar activities which are subject to penalties and imply financial gain”. The Directive states that “the exploitation of begging, including the use of a trafficked dependent person for begging, falls within the scope of the definition of trafficking in human beings only when all the elements of forced labour or services occur”.&lt;ref&gt;The European Parliament and Council of the European Union, Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA, Official Journal of the European Union, Brussels, 15 April 2011, par. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smuggling===
The United Nations [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air|Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]] defines human smuggling as the “procurement, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit of the illegal entry of a person into a State Party of which the person is not a national or a permanent resident”.  A smuggler facilitates the border crossing of others without the required travel documents and for financial or other gain. Once a smuggler has facilitated the border crossing or ensured the migrant’s arrival at the agreed destination, the contact between the smuggler and the smuggled migrants usually ceases. The smuggling of persons across international borders can be part of the act of trafficking when it is done for the purpose of exploiting the persons in the country of destination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although smuggling is considered a crime against the state, persons who are using the services of smugglers might be victimised by acts of violence while being smuggled or they might die due to unsafe transportation conditions.

===Sale of children===
The sale of children means any act or transaction whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another for remuneration or any other consideration. While trafficking could involve the purchase and sale of persons, the sale of children may lead to exploitation but does not necessarily have to. Children are sometimes sold in illegal adoptions, for instance. Children are also sold for sexual exploitation or labour. In these cases, there may be an overlap between trafficking and sale as two criminal acts within a single case.&lt;ref&gt;Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Article 2(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration and sustainable development ==
The link between migration and development have been widely recognised. Migration is directly relevant to the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. According to current demographic trends, the populations in richer countries will continue to age disproportionately while the younger generations are overrepresented in lower income countries, causing strain on the labour market, social security, education and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform, Transforming Our World – The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration can mitigate these population imbalances on both ends. It has a potential to increase the work force and strengthen the younger generations in numbers where needed. This would mean increased contributions to the social welfare systems in higher income countries of destination and a reduced strain on the social welfare systems in countries of origin with high poverty and unemployment rates. Migration and mobility policies should ideally facilitate a mutual exchange of knowledge, capacity and human resources while preventing one directional movements and brain drain. Seen from this point of view, migration holds potential benefits for poverty reduction and for fostering more equitable and sustainable global development.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, United Nations Population Division, University of Houston, International Migration, Children and Adolescents, Population Dynamics, October 2013, pp. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortina, Jeronimo 2013, p. 2"&gt;Cortina, Jeronimo, Children, Education and Migration: Win-win policy responses for co-development, QScience Proceedings, Family, Migration and Dignity Special Issue, University of Houston and United Nations Children’s Fund, Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals, 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The linkages between migration and development have implications for policy and practice in these areas and relevant measures need to be coordinated in countries of destination and origin.

From a human rights-based and development oriented perspective, countries of origin and destination share the responsibility for managing migration. Maximising the good developments and minimising the risks from migration could include developing the human capital of migrants and investing in migration management cooperation between countries of origin and destination in social, economic and political terms.&lt;ref name="Cortina, Jeronimo 2013, p. 2"/&gt;

==History of child migration by country==

=== Australia ===
During the  late 19th and early 20th centuries, many [[Aboriginal Australian]] children were removed from their families and placed in institutions and foster homes, in what became known as the [[Stolen Generations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Read | first = Peter | title = The Stolen Generations: The Removal of Aboriginal children in New South Wales 1883 to 1969 | publisher = Department of Aboriginal Affairs (New South Wales government) | year = 1981 | url = http://www.daa.nsw.gov.au/publications/StolenGenerations.pdf | isbn = 0-646-46221-0 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120409231929/http://www.daa.nsw.gov.au/publications/StolenGenerations.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

130,000 children were migrated to Australia under assisted [[Home Children|child migration schemes]] from Great Britain alone, with a small number from Malta. Child migrants were adopted or brought up in children's homes, institutions, orphanages or foster care. A large portion of these children were used in slave labour by the churches in Australia. Many of these children experienced [[Child neglect|neglect]] and [[Child abuse|abuse]] while in institutional care.

In November 2009 [[Australian Prime Minister]], [[Kevin Rudd]] formally apologized to "[[Forgotten Australians]]" and child migrants on behalf of the nation.&lt;ref name="sorry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pm.gov.au/node/6321 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405065659/http://www.pm.gov.au/node/6321 |archivedate=2010-04-05 |df= }} PMs apology&lt;/ref&gt; "Forgotten Australians" is a term the Australian Senate has used to describe children who were brought up in orphanages, children's homes, institutions or foster care in Australia. Child migrants are a specific group of "Forgotten Australians".&lt;ref&gt;http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=55757&amp;sid=582660 Adoption &amp; Forgotten Australians - Child Migrants&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
Child migration was a phenomenon associated with the migration of Bulgarian market-gardeners to Austria-Hungary in the second half of 19th and early 20th Century, due to the use of child labor (mostly boys) in market-gardening. Child labor brought master gardeners the biggest profit since children did not get paid but worked as apprentices for their keep only. Younger children helped in the gardens and learned gardening skills, while those who were already physically strong performed specialized gardening activities. Different patterns of child migration can be distinguished based on the autobiographies and personal life stories of market-gardeners: children who migrated with their market-gardening parents as a family or those of market-gardeners who were born abroad; children who migrated with one of the parents (usually the market-gardening father) or with relatives of the market-gardening father so as to “learn the craft”; children who migrated with their market-gardening parents as a family, then the parents returned to their homeland with the younger children, while the older child was left abroad to work “on a garden” and make his own living, thus supporting his family financially.&lt;ref&gt;http://penkapeykovska.blogspot.hu/p/blog-page_20.html Peykovska, Penka, Child Migration, Child Labor and School Attainment.

=== Canada ===
{{main|Canadian Indian residential school system}}
The Canadian Indian residential school system, founded in the 19th century, was intended to force the assimilation of the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] into European-Canadian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberni School Victim Speaks Out |url=http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/education/Default.htm |work=First Nations Drum |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726170335/http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/education/Default.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last residential school was closed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/16/f-timeline-residential-schools.html|title=A timeline of residential schools|publisher=CBC|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2008, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] apologized, on behalf of the sitting [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the [[CBC Television|CBC]], for the past governments' policies of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/11/aboriginal-apology.html PM cites 'sad chapter' in apology for residential schools] - cbc.ca, June 11, 2008. Retrieved 2009-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] expressed his sorrow at "the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church" and offered his "sympathy and prayerful solidarity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/23774.php?index=23774&amp;lang=en Communique of the Holy See Press Office]. 29.4.2009. Retrieved 2009-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malta ===
310 children were emigrated from Malta to Australia between 1950 and 1965 under the ‘Child Migration to Australia Scheme’ following an agreement between the Australian Catholic Immigration committee and the Emigration and Labour Minister on 9 December 1949.&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=97331|title=Australian PM apologises for child abuse|last=Attard|first=Elaine|work=The Malta Independent online|publisher=Standard Publications Ltd|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Maltese children sent to Australia under this scheme came either from government orphanages or Church children’s homes and all were said to have left with their parents’ consent. The Australian government had offered to welcome Maltese boys, aged between eight and 11, and girls aged between five and 10 years into Catholic institutions and promised to offer them employment supervised by the responsible Catholic authorities.&lt;ref name="apology" /&gt; One of these children became a priest and many others embarked on a career though many grew up hurt knowing that their parents had consented to their departure from home.&lt;ref name="apology" /&gt; The Maltese emigrants were included in the Australian Prime Minister's 2009 public apology to those who suffered abuse at the hands of their carers in institutions, orphanages and foster care.&lt;ref name="apology" /&gt;

===Mandatory Palestine===
During World War II, thousands of [[unaccompanied minor]]s from Jewish families in Nazi-occupied Europe were [[Youth Aliyah|transported to relative safety in Mandatory Palestine]] (now Israel).

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Home Children}}
The practice of sending poor or [[orphan]]ed children to the [[English overseas possessions|English]] [[settler colony|settler colonies]], to help alleviate the shortage of labour, began in [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1618, with the rounding-up and transportation of 100 [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] children to the [[Virginia Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldonian.org/barnardo/child_migrationl.htm|title=A child migration timeline|work=The Goldonian|publisher=Goldonian Web|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the second half of the twentieth century, the Home Children programme was seen as a way to move impoverished children to a "better life" in Australia, Canada and elsewhere, also providing good "white stock" to former colonies.  The children and parents were not consulted, and often siblings were separated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Child Labor]] By Sandy Hobbs, Jim McKechnie, [[Michael Lavalette]] p. 33, 34&lt;/ref&gt; In total 130,000 children were sent from the United Kingdom to Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Australia.  Often children were lied to about their parents being dead and many faced abuse in their new homes.&lt;ref name="sorry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8361389.stm|title=Australia 'sorry' for child abuse|last=Anon|date=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010 [[British Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]] issued an official apology for the 'shameful' child resettlement programme and announced a £6 million fund designed to compensate the families affected by the "misguided" programme.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7039505.ece|title=Gordon Brown sorry for 'shameful' colonial child resettlement programme|last=Ralph|first=Alex|date=24 February 2010|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Child Migrants Trust has since set up the Family Restoration Fund in order to use this money to help reunite former child migrants with their families as part of the British government's package of support to former child migrants and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childmigrantstrust.com/services/family-restoration-fund|title=Family Restoration Fund|last=Anon|work=Child migrants Trust|publisher=Child Migrants Trust|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], some 3.5 million children were evacuated from areas at risk of aerial bombing to rural locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evacuees.org.uk/|title=Home page|last=Anon|work=The Evacuees Reunion Association.|publisher=The Evacuees Reunion Association.|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II]].)

Also during World War II, nearly 10,000 [[unaccompanied minor]]s from Jewish families in Nazi-occupied Europe were [[Kindertransport|transported to safety in the UK]].

A study completed in 2012 by the [[University of Oxford]]'s Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) led by Dr Nando Sigona has shed light on the situation of children with no right to live in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://irregularvoices.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/no-way-out-no-way-in-migrant-children-fall-through-the-net/&lt;/ref&gt; The study, 'No way out, no way in: Irregular migrant children and families in the UK', estimates a population of 120,000 children without status, of whom 65,000 were born in the UK to parents with no right to live in the country.

=== United States ===
During the 19th century there were a number of attempts to move children from crowded east coast cities to midwestern and western rural families &amp; orphanages. Most famous was the [[orphan train]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = John | last =Torigoe |date=24 December 2008| title =He rode the 'Orphan Train' across the country| journal =CNN | url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/12/24/orphan.trains/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Native American children were separated from their families &amp; sent to [[Americanization (of Native Americans)#Native American education and boarding schools|boarding schools]] to force them into assimilating western culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html  Andrea Smith, "Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools"], ''Amnesty Magazine'', Amnesty International website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
During the Second World War, when Finland was at war with Russia, about 70 000 Finnish children were transported by train and boat mainly to Sweden, but also to Norway and Denmark. These children are commonly referred to as [[Finnish war children|war children]]. By the end of the war, thousands of children were adopted by their "new" parents.

==Overview==

The term "cognitive liberty" was coined by [[neuroethics|neuroethicist]] Dr. [[Wrye Sententia]] and legal theorist and lawyer [[Richard Glen Boire]], the founders and directors of the non-profit [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/index.html Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics] (CCLE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sententia|first=Wrye|chapter=Freedom by Design: Transhumanist Values and Cognitive Liberty|title=The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, Technology and Philosophy of the Human Future|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sententia and Boire define cognitive liberty as "the right of each individual to think independently and autonomously, to use the full power of his or her mind, and to engage in multiple modes of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  FAQ - Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics (CCLE) | work = General Info  | publisher = Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics | date= 2003-09-15  | url = http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/faqs/faq_general.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sententia and Boire conceived of the concept of cognitive liberty as a response to the increasing ability of technology to monitor and manipulate cognitive function, and the corresponding increase in the need to ensure individual cognitive autonomy and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia divides the practical application of cognitive liberty into two principles:

#As long as their behavior does not endanger others, individuals should not be compelled against their will to use technologies that directly interact with the brain or be forced to take certain psychoactive drugs.
#As long as they do not subsequently engage in behavior that harms others, individuals should not be prohibited from, or criminalized for, using new mind-enhancing drugs and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 227&lt;/ref&gt;

These two facets of cognitive liberty are reminiscent of [[Timothy Leary|Timothy Leary's]] "Two Commandments for the Molecular Age", from his 1968 book ''The Politics of Ecstasy'':

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
  | Thou shalt not alter the consciousness of thy fellow man
  | Thou shalt not prevent thy fellow man from altering his own consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leary|first=Timothy|title=The Politics of Ecstasy|date=1968|publisher=Ronin Publishing|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1579510310|page=95|url=https://archive.org/details/ecstaspoliticsof00learrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Supporters of cognitive liberty therefore seek to impose both a negative and a positive obligation on states: to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, and to allow individuals to self-determine their own "inner realm" and control their own mental functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from interference===

This first obligation, to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, seeks to protect individuals from having their mental processes altered or monitored without their consent or knowledge, "setting up a defensive wall against unwanted intrusions".&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Ongoing improvements to [[neurotechnology|neurotechnologies]] such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and [[electroencephalography]] (or "brain fingerprinting"); and to pharmacology in the form of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[Nootropics]], [[Modafinil]] and other [[psychoactive drugs]], are continuing to increase the ability to both monitor and directly influence human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blitz|first=Marc Jonathan|title=Freedom of Thought for the Extended Mind: Cognitive Enhancement and the Constitution|journal=Wisconsin Law Review|date=2010|issue=1049|pages=1053–1055, 1058–1060|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=marc_jonathan_blitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|title=The Brain on the Stand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many theorists have emphasized the importance of recognizing cognitive liberty in order to protect individuals from the state using such technologies to alter those individuals’ mental processes: "states must be barred from invading the inner sphere of persons, from accessing their thoughts, modulating their emotions or manipulating their personal preferences."&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

This element of cognitive liberty has been raised in relation to a number of state-sanctioned interventions in individual cognition, from the mandatory psychiatric 'treatment' of homosexuals in the US before the 1970s, to the non-consensual administration of psychoactive drugs to unwitting US citizens during [[CIA]] [[Project MKUltra]], to the forcible administration of mind-altering drugs on individuals to make them competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boire|first=Richard Glen|title=On Cognitive Liberty Part I|journal=Journal of Cognitive Liberties|date=1999|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/curriculum/oncoglib_123.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). ''[http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/sell_ussc_merits.pdf Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics In Support Of The Petition]'', in the case of ''Sell v United States''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futurist]] and bioethicist [[George Dvorsky]], Chair of the Board of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] has identified this element of cognitive liberty as being of relevance to the [[autism rights movement|debate]] around the curing of [[autism spectrum]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dvorsky|first=George|title=Cognitive liberty and the right to one's mind|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/dvorsky20091020|publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke University School of Law]] Professor [[Nita Farahany]] has also proposed legislative protection of cognitive liberty as a way of safeguarding the protection from self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, in the light of the increasing ability to access human memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farahany|first=Nita|title=Incriminating Thoughts|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=February 2012|volume=64|pages=405–406|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5321&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this element of cognitive liberty is often defined as an individual’s freedom from ''state'' interference with human cognition, Jan Christoph Bublitz and Reinhard Merkel among others suggest that cognitive liberty should also prevent other, non-state entities from interfering with an individual’s mental "inner realm".&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Bublitz and Merkel propose the introduction of a new criminal offense punishing "interventions severely interfering with another’s mental integrity by undermining mental control or exploiting pre-existing mental weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Direct interventions that reduce or impair cognitive capacities such as memory, concentration, and willpower; alter preferences, beliefs, or behavioral dispositions; elicit inappropriate emotions; or inflict clinically identifiable mental injuries would all be ''prima facie'' impermissible and subject to criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68-70&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia and Boire have also expressed concern that corporations and other non-state entities might utilize emerging neurotechnologies to alter individuals' mental processes without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom to self-determine===
Where the first obligation seeks to protect individuals from interference with cognitive processes by the state, corporations or other individuals, this second obligation seeks to ensure that individuals have the freedom to alter or enhance their own consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who enjoys this aspect of cognitive liberty has the freedom to alter their mental processes in any way they wish to; whether through indirect methods such as [[meditation]], [[yoga]] or [[prayer]]; or through direct cognitive intervention through [[psychoactive drugs]] or [[neurotechnology]].

As psychotropic drugs are a powerful method of altering cognitive function, many advocates of cognitive liberty are also advocates of drug law reform; claiming that the "[[war on drugs]]" is in fact a "war on mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boire|first=Richard Glen|title=On Cognitive Liberty Part II|journal=Journal of Cognitive Liberties|date=2000|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/2jcl/2JCL7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCLE, as well as other cognitive liberty advocacy groups such as [http://cognitivelibertyuk.wordpress.com/ Cognitive Liberty UK], have lobbied for the re-examination and reform of prohibited drug law; one of the CCLE's key guiding principles is that: "governments should not criminally prohibit cognitive enhancement or the experience of any mental state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping Freedom in Mind|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/mission.html|publisher=Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for reform of restrictions on the use of prescription cognitive-enhancement drugs (also called smart drugs or [[nootropics]]) such as [[Prozac]], [[Ritalin]] and [[Adderall]] have also been made on the grounds of cognitive liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Blitz, 1058-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

This element of cognitive liberty is also of great importance to proponents of the [[transhumanism|transhumanist movement]], a key tenet of which is the [[human enhancement|enhancement]] of human mental function. Dr Wrye Sententia has emphasized the importance of cognitive liberty in ensuring the freedom to pursue human mental enhancement, as well as the freedom to choose against enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia argues that the recognition of a "right to (and not to) direct, modify, or enhance one's thought processes" is vital to the free application of [[List of emerging technologies#Neuroscience|emerging]] [[neurotechnology]] to enhance human cognition; and that something beyond the current conception of freedom of thought is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 355-6&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia claims that "cognitive liberty's strength is that it protects those who do want to alter their brains, but also those who do not".&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with recognized human rights==
Cognitive liberty is not currently recognized as a human right by any international human rights treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt; While [[freedom of thought]] is recognized by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), freedom of thought can be distinguished from cognitive liberty in that the former is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to think ''whatever'' they want, whereas cognitive liberty is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to think ''however'' they want.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive liberty seeks to protect an individual’s right to determine their own state of mind and be free from external control over their state of mind, rather than just protecting the content of an individuals’ thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been suggested that the lack of protection of cognitive liberty in previous human rights instruments was due to the relative lack of technology capable of directly interfering with mental autonomy at the time the core human rights treaties were created.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; As the human mind was considered invulnerable to direct manipulation, control or alteration, it was deemed unnecessary to expressly protect individuals from unwanted mental interference.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 61&lt;/ref&gt; With modern advances in [[neuroscience]] and in anticipation of its future development however, it is argued that such express protection is becoming increasingly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive liberty then can be seen as an extension of or an "update" to the right to freedom of thought as it has been traditionally understood.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt;  Freedom of thought should now be understood to include the right to determine one’s own mental state as well as the content of one’s thoughts. However, some have instead argued that cognitive liberty is already an inherent part of the international human rights framework as the principle underlying the rights to freedom of thought, expression and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom to think in whatever manner one chooses is a "necessary precondition to those guaranteed freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Waterman]] and [[Casey William Hardison]] have argued that cognitive liberty is fundamental to Freedom of Thought because it encompasses the ability to have certain types of experiences, including the right to experience altered or non-ordinary states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, 345&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that cognitive liberty can be seen to be a part of the inherent [[dignity]] of human beings as recognized by Article 1 of the UDHR.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Most proponents of cognitive liberty agree however that cognitive liberty should be expressly recognized as a human right in order to properly provide protection for individual cognitive autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farahany, 405-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 226-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal recognition==

===In the United States===
{{main|Sell v. United States}}
Richard Glen Boire of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics filed an [[amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] with the [[US Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Sell v. United States]]'', in which the Supreme Court examined whether the court had the power to make an order to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to an individual who had refused such treatment, for the sole purpose of making them [[competence (law)|competent]] to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/sell_ussc_merits.pdf "Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics In Support Of The Petition, in the case of Sell v United States"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/166/case.html ''Sell v. United States'' 539 U.S. 166 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
In the case of [[Casey William Hardison|''R v Hardison'']], the defendant, charged with eight counts under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (MDA), including the production of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[LSD]], claimed that cognitive liberty was safeguarded by [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 9]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;R v Hardison [2007] 1 Cr App R (S) 37&lt;/ref&gt; Hardison argued that "individual sovereignty over one's interior environment constitutes the very core of what it means to be free", and that as psychotropic drugs are a potent method of altering an individual's mental process, prohibition of them under the MDA was in opposition to Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 433&lt;/ref&gt; The court however disagreed, calling Hardison's arguments a "portmanteau defense" and relying upon the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|UN Drug Conventions]] and the earlier case of ''R v Taylor'' to deny Hardison's right to appeal to a superior court.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 437&lt;/ref&gt; Hardison was convicted and given a 20-year prison sentence, though he was released on 29 May 2013 after nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Drug policy reform|Human enhancement}}

While there has been little publicized criticism of the concept of cognitive liberty itself, drug policy reform and the concept of human enhancement, both closely linked to cognitive liberty, remain highly controversial issues. The risks inherent in removing restrictions on controlled cognitive-enhancing drugs, including of widening the gap between those able to afford such treatments and those unable to do so, have caused many to remain skeptical about the wisdom of recognizing cognitive liberty as a right.&lt;ref&gt;Blitz, 1063&lt;/ref&gt; [[political philosophy|Political philosopher]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Michael J. Sandel]], when examining the prospect of [[Nootropics|memory enhancement]], wrote that "some who worry about the ethics of cognitive enhancement point to the danger of creating two classes of human beings – those with access to enhancement technologies, and those who must make do with an unaltered memory that fades with age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandel|first=Michael J.|title=The Case against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674036383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive liberty then faces opposition obliquely in these interrelated debates.

[[File:Jacek Malczewski, Śmierć.jpg|thumb|right|''Śmierć'' ("Death"), a 1902 painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]]]]
'''Consciousness after death''' is a common theme in [[society]] and [[culture]] in the context of [[Afterlife|life after death]].  [[Science|Scientific]] [[research]] has established that the [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the [[brain]], the cessation of which defines [[brain death]]. However, many believe in some form of [[Afterlife|life after death]], which is a feature of many [[religion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Neuroscience==

[[Neuroscience]] is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the [[premise]] that all of [[behavior]] and all of the [[mental function|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the [[nervous system]], especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Neural_Science_Fifth_Editi.html?id=s64z-LdAIsEC Principles of Neural Science, Fifth Edition]" (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squire, L. et al. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamental_Neuroscience.html?id=AEmEn-_hD9IC Fundamental Neuroscience, 4th edition]" (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Carter Snead. "[http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1557&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship Neuroimaging and the "Complexity" of Capital Punishment]" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Kandel, M.D. "[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=172780 A New Intellectual Framework for Psychiatry]" (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience Core Concepts: The Essential Principles of Neuroscience|website=BrainFacts.org: Explore the Brain and Mind|url=http://www.brainfacts.org/about-neuroscience/core-concepts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple lines of [[scientific evidence|evidence]] that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples.

* '''Neuroanatomical correlates''': In the field of [[neuroimaging]], [[neuroscientist]]s can use various [[functional neuroimaging]] methods to measure an aspect of brain function that correlates with a particular mental state or process.
* '''Experimental manipulations''': Neuroimaging (correlational) studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of mental processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]] and necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit [[Experiment|experimental manipulation]] of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes [[consciousness]], then a causal role for that brain activity can be [[Inference|inferred]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Velmans, Susan Schneider. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Blackwell_Companion_to_Consciousness.html?id=B1lRZmOzuJ0C The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness]" (2008). p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most common types of manipulation experiments are loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. In a loss-of-function (also called "necessity") experiment, a part of the nervous system is diminished or removed in an attempt to determine if it is necessary for a certain process to occur, and in a gain-of-function (also called "sufficiency") experiment, an aspect of the nervous system is increased relative to normal.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Carter, Jennifer C. Shieh. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Guide_to_Research_Techniques_in_Neurosci.html?id=3rT4ngEACAAJ Guide to Research Techniques in Neuroscience]" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of brain activity can be performed in several ways:
::'''Pharmacological manipulation''' using various [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] which alter neural activity by interfering with [[neurotransmission]], resulting in alterations in [[perception]], [[mood (psychology)|mood]], consciousness, cognition, and behavior. Psychoactive drugs are divided into different groups according to their pharmacological effects; [[euphoriants]] which tend to induce feelings of [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[stimulant]]s that induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions, [[depressant]]s that depress or reduce arousal or stimulation and [[hallucinogen]]s which can cause [[hallucinations]], perception anomalies, and other substantial subjective changes in thoughts, emotion, and consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
::'''Electrical and magnetical stimulations''' using various [[Electrical brain stimulation|electrical methods]] and techniques like [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]].

::'''[[Optogenetics|Optogenetic]] manipulation''' where light is used to control neurons which have been genetically sensitised to light.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
* '''[[brain injury|Symptoms of brain damage]]''': Examining case studies (like the case of [[Phineas Gage]]) and [[lesion]] studies are the only sources of knowledge regarding what happens to the mind when the brain is damaged. Various symptoms have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traumaticbraininjury.com/symptoms-of-tbi/severe-tbi-symptoms/, "Severe TBI Symptoms"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braininjury.com/symptoms.shtml, "Symptoms of Brain Injury"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{Main|Death}}
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness|disorders of consciousness}}
Death is the cessation of all [[biological process|biological functions]] that sustain a living [[organism]]. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).&lt;ref name="enc bd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathreference.com/Bl-Ce/Brain-Death.html |title=Brain death| website=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| accessdate= 25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death?source=search_result&amp;search=brain+death&amp;selectedTitle=1~37 | title=Diagnosis of brain death| last=Young | first= G Bryan| website=UpToDate|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4103/0972-5229.53108| pmid = 19881172| title = The diagnosis of brain death| journal = Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 7–11| year = 2009| last1 = Goila | first1 = A. | last2 = Pawar | first2 = M. | pmc = 2772257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4081/ni.2010.e2| pmid = 21577338| pmc = 3093212| title = Diagnosis of brain death| journal = Neurology International| volume = 2| issue = 1| year = 2010| last1 = Machado | first1 = C.| pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Near-death experience (NDE)==
{{Main|Near-death experience}}
A near-death experience (NDE) is a [[personal experience]] associated with impending [[death]], encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a [[hallucination|hallucinatory state]] caused by various neurological factors such as [[cerebral anoxia]], [[Hypercapnia|hypercarbia]], abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Blanke, Sebastian Dieguez. "[http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/154824/files/2009_Blanke_TNC%28chap%29_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind%20-%20obe%20and%20nde.pdf Leaving Body and Life Behind: Out-of-Body and Near-Death Experience]" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copenhagen–Tartu school of biosemiotics''' is a loose network of scholars working within the discipline of [[biosemiotics]] at the [[University of Tartu]] and the [[University of Copenhagen]]. 

==History==
The school has been instrumental in developing biosemiotics as a new perspective on the study of life, in the [[biology|biological]] and [[environmental science]]s.

'''Disability Insurance''', often called '''DI''' or '''disability income insurance''', or '''income protection''', is a form of [[insurance]] that insures the beneficiary's earned income against the risk that a [[disability]] creates a barrier for a worker to complete the core functions of their work. For example, the worker may suffer from an inability to maintain composure in the case of psychological disorders or an injury, illness or condition that causes physical impairment or incapacity to work. It encompasses paid sick leave, short-term [[disability benefits]] (STD), and long-term disability benefits (LTD).&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that in the US a disabling accident occurs, on average, once every second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Statistics |date=March 12, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=National Treasury Employees Union - Chapter 78 |url=http://nteu-chapter78.org/documents/member_benefits/Disability%20Statistics.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727133227/http://nteu-chapter78.org/documents/member_benefits/Disability%20Statistics.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, nearly 18.5% of Americans are currently living with a disability,{{cn|date=February 2016}} and 1 out of every 4 persons in the US workforce will suffer a disabling injury before retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Insurance Infographic |date=January 18, 2013 |url=http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/disability-insurance-infographic.html |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123064308/http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/disability-insurance-infographic.html |archivedate=January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Railway Passengers Assurance Company header.jpg|thumb|190x190px|The Railway Passengers Assurance Company was founded in 1848 as the first company to provide [[accident insurance]].]]
In the late 19th century, modern disability insurance began to become available. It was originally known as "accident insurance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/health-insurance1.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks |title=How Health Insurance Works|date=2006-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encarta |title=Health Insurance |url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576408_8/Health_Insurance.html#s49 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqZV6V7?url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576408_8/Health_Insurance.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first company to offer accident insurance was the Railway Passengers Assurance Company, formed in 1848 in [[England]] to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent [[railway]] system. It was registered as the Universal Casualty Compensation Company to:
:...grant assurances on the lives of persons travelling by railway and to grant, in cases, of accident not having a fatal termination, compensation to the assured for injuries received under certain conditions.

The company was able to reach an agreement with the [[railway company|railway companies]], whereby basic accident insurance would be sold as a package deal along with travel [[Train ticket|ticket]]s to customers. The company charged higher premiums for second and third class travel due to the higher risk of injury in the roofless [[carriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/heritage/companies/railway-passengers-assurance-company/|title=Railway Passengers Assurance Company Ltd|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. P. Woodward |title=The Disability Insurance Policy |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=March 1917 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=227–237 |url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/70/1/227.extract |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual disability insurance===
Those whose employers do not provide benefits, and self-employed individuals who desire disability coverage, may purchase  policies. Premiums and available benefits for individual coverage vary considerably between companies, occupations, states and countries. In general, premiums are higher for policies that provide more monthly benefits, offer benefits for longer periods of time, and start payments of benefits more quickly following a disability claim. Premiums also tend to be higher for policies that define disability in broader terms, meaning the policy would pay benefits in a wider variety of circumstances thus covering more insurances that the individual was going to purchase. Web-based disability insurance calculators assist in determining the disability insurance needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifehappens.org/disability-insurance/disability-calculator |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422184302/http://www.lifehappens.org/disability-insurance/disability-calculator |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-22 |title=LIFE Foundation &amp;#124; Disability Insurance Needs Calculator |publisher=Lifehappens.org |accessdate=2011-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-limit disability insurance===
High-limit disability insurance is designed to keep individual disability benefits at 65% of income regardless of income level. Coverage is typically issued supplemental to standard coverage. With high-limit disability insurance, benefits can be anywhere from an additional $2,000 to $100,000 per month. Single policy issue and participation (individual or group long-term disability) coverage has gone up to $30,000 with some hospitals. 

===Business overhead expense disability insurance===
Business Overhead Expense (BOE) coverage reimburses a business for overhead expenses should the owner experience a disability.  Eligible benefits include: rent or mortgage payments, utilities, leasing costs, laundry/maintenance, accounting/billing and collection service fees, business insurance premiums, employee salaries, employee benefits, property tax, and other regular monthly expenses.

===National social insurance programs===
In most developed countries, the single most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s version is part of [[National Insurance]]; the [[United States|U.S.]]'s version is [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security (SS)]]—specifically, several parts of SS including [[Social Security Disability Insurance|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]]. These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are the safety net that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In addition to federally funded programs, there are five states which currently offer state funded Disability Insurance programs. These programs are designed for short term disabilities only. The coverage amount is determined by the applicant's level of income over the previous 12 months. The states which currently fund disability insurance programs are California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/does-my-state-offer-disability-insurance.html|title=Does My State Offer Disability Insurance?|last=|first=|date=2013-12-17|website=DisabilityInsurance.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120113033/http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/does-my-state-offer-disability-insurance.html|archivedate=January 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-01-17|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer-supplied disability insurance===
One of the most common reasons for disability is on-the-job injury, which explains why the second largest form of disability insurance is that provided by employers to cover their employees. There are several subtypes that may or may not be separate parts of the benefits package: workers' compensation and more general disability insurance policies.

====Workers' compensation====
{{main|Workers' compensation}}
Workers' compensation (also known by variations of that name, e.g., '''workman's comp''', '''workmen's comp''', '''worker's comp''', '''compo''') offers payments to employees who are (usually temporarily, rarely permanently) unable to work because of a job-related injury. However, workers' compensation is in fact more than just income insurance, because it compensates for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and life expenses (functioning in this case as a form of [[health insurance]]), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment (offering a form of [[life insurance]]).  Workers compensation provides no coverage to those not working. Statistics have shown that the majority of disabilities occur while the injured person is not working and therefore is not covered by workers' compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/chances_disability/causes.asp |title=Common Causes of Disability; Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Arthritis and Lifestyle Choices |publisher=Disabilitycanhappen.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's cover story for March 5, 2007 discussed the problems that American veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq wars have faced in receiving VA benefits. The article describes one veteran who waited 17 months to start receiving payments. Another article, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', points out that besides long waits, there is also variation based on the veteran's state of residence and whether he/she is a veteran of the Army, National Guard, or Reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | last = Urbina | first = Ian |author2=Ron Nixon | title = Veterans Face Vast Inequities Over Disability | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2007-03-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/washington/09veterans.html
 | accessdate = 2007-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article says that it can be difficult for a veteran to get his or her claim approved; ''Newsweek'' described the benefits thus:

:"A veteran with a disability rating of 100 percent gets about $2,400 a month—more if he or she has children. A 50 percent rating brings in around $700 a month. But for many returning servicemen burdened with wounds, it is, initially at least, their sole income."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Forgotten Heroes |work=Newsweek |volume=149 |issue=10 |pages=28–37 |date=March 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316437/site/newsweek/ |pmid=17380811 |last1=Ephron |first1=D |last2=Childress |first2=S |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issn=0028-9604 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227133416/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316437/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=February 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 figures cited above correspond in 2012 to $2,673 a month (more with children) and, for the 50% rating, $797 a month for a single veteran.

According to a sidebar in the same Newsweek article,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Untreated Wounds |journal=Newsweek |volume=149 |issue=10 |page=34 |date=March 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316435/site/newsweek/ |pmid=17380812 |last1=Dehghanpisheh |first1=B |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issn=0028-9604 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302104104/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316435/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=March 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Americans injured in these wars, for all the obstacles to proper care, will probably receive much better compensation and health care than equally injured Afghan or Iraqi soldiers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8704">A '''Ducci sequence''' is a sequence of [[n-tuple|''n''-tuples]] of [[integer]]s, sometimes known as "the Diffy game", because it is based on sequences.

Given an ''n''-tuple of integers &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, the next ''n''-tuple in the sequence is formed by taking the absolute differences of neighbouring integers:

:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,...,a_n) \rightarrow (|a_1-a_2|, |a_2-a_3|, ..., |a_n-a_1|)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Another way of describing this is as follows. Arrange ''n'' integers in a circle and make a new circle by taking the difference between neighbours, ignoring any minus signs; then repeat the operation. Ducci sequences are named after Enrico Ducci (1864 - 1940), the Italian mathematician who discovered this in the 1930s.

Ducci sequences are also known as the '''Ducci map''' or the '''n-number game'''. Open problems in the study of these maps still remain.&lt;ref name="Chamberland&amp;Thomas2004"&gt;{{cite journal

==Properties==
From the second ''n''-tuple onwards, it is clear that every integer in each ''n''-tuple in a Ducci sequence is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum members of the first ''n''-tuple. As there are only a finite number of possible ''n''-tuples with these constraints, the sequence of n-tuples must sooner or later repeat itself. Every Ducci sequence therefore eventually becomes [[Periodic function|periodic]].

If ''n'' is a power of 2 every Ducci sequence eventually reaches the ''n''-tuple (0,0,...,0) in a finite number of steps.&lt;ref name="Chamberland&amp;Thomas2004" /&gt;

If ''n'' is ''not'' a power of two, a Ducci sequence will either eventually reach an ''n''-tuple of zeros or will settle into a periodic loop of 'binary' ''n''-tuples; that is, ''n''-tuples of form &lt;math&gt;k(b_1, b_2, ... b_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and &lt;math&gt;b_i \in \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

An obvious generalisation of Ducci sequences is to allow the members of the ''n''-tuples to be any real numbers rather than just integers. The properties presented here do not always hold for these generalisations. For example, a Ducci sequence starting with the ''n''-tuple (1, ''q'', ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) where ''q'' is the (irrational) positive root of the cubic &lt;math&gt;x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; does not reach (0,0,0,0) in a finite number of steps, although in the limit it converges to (0,0,0,0).&lt;ref name="Brockman"&gt;{{cite journal

Ducci sequences may be arbitrarily long before they reach a tuple of zeros or a periodic loop. The 4-tuple sequence starting with (0, 653, 1854, 4063) takes 24 iterations to reach the zeros tuple.

&lt;math&gt;
(0, 653, 1854, 4063) \rightarrow
(653, 1201, 2209, 4063) \rightarrow
(548, 1008, 1854, 3410) \rightarrow
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\cdots \rightarrow
(0, 0, 128, 128) \rightarrow
(0, 128, 0, 128) \rightarrow
(128, 128, 128, 128) \rightarrow
(0, 0, 0, 0)
&lt;/math&gt;

This 5-tuple sequence enters a period 15 binary 'loop'  after 7 iterations.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1     5     7     9     9 \rightarrow &amp;
4     2     2     0     8 \rightarrow &amp;
2     0     2     8     4 \rightarrow &amp;
2     2     6     4     2 \rightarrow &amp;
0     4     2     2     0 \rightarrow &amp;
4     2     0     2     0 \rightarrow \\
2     2     2     2     4 \rightarrow &amp;
0     0     0     2     2 \rightarrow &amp;
0     0     2     0     2 \rightarrow &amp;
0     2     2     2     2 \rightarrow &amp;
2     0     0     0     2 \rightarrow &amp;
2     0     0     2     0 \rightarrow \\
2     0     2     2     2 \rightarrow &amp;
2     2     0     0     0 \rightarrow &amp;
0     2     0     0     2 \rightarrow &amp;
2     2     0     2     2 \rightarrow &amp;
0     2     2     0     0 \rightarrow &amp;
2     0     2     0     0 \rightarrow \\
2     2     2     0     2 \rightarrow &amp;
0     0     2     2     0 \rightarrow &amp;
0     2     0     2     0 \rightarrow &amp;
2     2     2     2     0 \rightarrow &amp;
0     0     0     2     2 \rightarrow &amp;
\cdots \quad \quad \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The following 6-tuple sequence shows that sequences of tuples whose length is not a power of two may still reach a tuple of zeros:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1     2     1     2     1     0 \rightarrow &amp;
1     1     1     1     1     1 \rightarrow &amp;
0     0     0     0     0     0 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

If some conditions are imposed on any "power of two"-tuple Ducci sequence, it would take that power of two or lesser iterations to reach the zeros tuple. It is hypothesized that these sequences conform to a rule.&lt;ref name="E.Miztani, A.Nozaki, T.Sawatari 2013"&gt;{{cite journal

==Modulo two form==
When the Ducci sequences enter binary loops, it is possible to treat the sequence in modulo two. That is:&lt;ref name="Breauer"&gt;Florian Breuer, "Ducci sequences in higher dimensions" in INTEGERS: ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL NUMBER THEORY 7 (2007) [http://www.integers-ejcnt.org/h24/h24.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(|a_1-a_2|, |a_2-a_3|, ..., |a_n-a_1|)\ = (a_1+a_2, a_2+a_3, ..., a_n + a_1)\ mod 2&lt;/math&gt;
This forms the basis for proving when the sequence vanish to all zeros.

==Cellular automata==
[[File:CA rule 102.png|140px|right]]
The linear map in modulo 2 can further be identified as the cellular automata denoted as '''rule 102''' in [[Wolfram code]] and related to [[rule 90]] through the Martin-Odlyzko-Wolfram map.&lt;ref&gt;S Lettieri, JG Stevens, DM Thomas, "Characteristic and minimal polynomials of linear cellular automata" in Rocky Mountain J. Math, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Misiurewicz, JG Stevens, DM Thomas, "Iterations of linear maps over finite fields", Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 102 reproduces the [[Sierpinski triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Rule 102." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule102.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other related topics==
The Ducci map is an example of a [[difference equation]], a category that also include [[non-linear dynamics]], [[chaos theory]] and [[numerical analysis]]. Similarities to [[cyclotomic polynomials]] have also been pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;F. Breuer et al. 'Ducci-sequences and cyclotomic polynomials' in [[Finite Fields and Their Applications]] 13 (2007) 293–304&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no practical applications of the Ducci map at present, its connection to the highly applied field of difference equations led &lt;ref name="Brockman"/&gt; to conjecture that a form of the Ducci map may also find application in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16808">''Energy recycling'' is the [[energy recovery]] process of utilizing energy that would normally be wasted, usually by converting it into [[electricity]] or [[thermal energy]].  Undertaken at manufacturing facilities, power plants, and large institutions such as hospitals and universities, it significantly increases efficiency, thereby reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas pollution simultaneously.  The process is noted for its potential to mitigate global warming profitably.&lt;ref name="orionmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/467/|title=The Unsung Solution: What rhymes with waste heat recovery?|work=[[Orion Magazine, November/December 2007]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work is usually done in the form of [[combined heat and power]] (also called [[cogeneration]]) or [[waste heat recovery]].

== Forms of energy recycling ==
'''[[Waste heat]] recovery''' is a process that captures excess heat that would normally be discharged at manufacturing facilities and converts it into electricity and steam, or returns energy to the manufacturing process in the form of heated air, water, glycol, or oil.&lt;ref name="thecmmgroup.com"&gt;[http://www.thecmmgroup.com/energy-recovery-systems Energy Recovery Systems], The CMM Group.&lt;/ref&gt; A "waste heat recovery boiler" contains a series of water-filled tubes placed throughout the area where heat is released. When high-temperature heat meets the boiler, steam is produced, which in turn powers a turbine that creates electricity. This process is similar to that of other fired boilers, but in this case, waste heat replaces a traditional flame. No fossil fuels are used in this process. Metals, glass, pulp and paper, silicon and other production plants are typical locations where waste heat recovery can be effective.&lt;ref name="orionmagazine.org"/&gt;

'''Waste heat recovery from air conditioning''' is also used as an alternative to wasting heat to the atmosphere from chiller plants. Heat recovered in summer from chiller plants is stored in Thermalbanks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html 'Thermalbanks']&lt;/ref&gt; in the ground and recycled back to the same building in winter via a heat pump to provide heating without burning fossil fuels. This elegant approach saves energy - and carbon - in both seasons by recycling summer heat for winter use.

'''[[Combined heat and power]] (CHP)''', also called [[cogeneration]], is, according to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], “an efficient, clean, and reliable approach to generating electricity and heat energy from a single fuel source. By installing a CHP system designed to meet the thermal and electrical base loads of a facility, CHP can greatly increase the facility's operational efficiency and decrease energy costs. At the same time, CHP reduces the emission of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global climate change.”   When electricity is produced on-site with a CHP plant, excess heat is recycled to produce both processed heat and additional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/|title=Combined Heat and Power Partnership|work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uschpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschpa.org/index.html|title=Clean Heat and Power Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701010700/http://www.uschpa.org/index.html|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enabling technologies:'''  [[Heat pumps]] and [[thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the recycling of energy that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

== Current system ==
Both waste heat recovery and CHP constitute "decentralized" energy production, which is in contrast to traditional "centralized" power generated at large power plants run by regional utilities.&lt;ref name="uschpa.org"/&gt;  The “centralized” system has an average efficiency of 34 percent, requiring about three units of fuel to produce one unit of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/fuelelectric.html|title=Electricity|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By capturing both heat and power, CHP and waste heat recovery projects have higher efficiencies.

A 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of CHP in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hedman, Energy and Environmental Analysis/USCHPA, "Combined Heat and Power and Heat Recovery as Energy Efficiency Options", Briefing to Senate Renewable Energy Caucus, September 10, 2007, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/843010-3bxGVs/native/843010.pdf|title=Clean Energy Technologies: a Preliminary Inventory of the Potential for Electricity Generation, Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, 4/05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies suggest about 200,000 megawatts—or 20% -- of total power capacity that could come from energy recycling in the U.S.  Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat2p2.html|title=The Energy Information Administration, Existing Capacity by Energy Source, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, as of 2005, about 42 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27 percent from the production of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |title=Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks |work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218171807/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |archivedate=2011-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/emission.html|title=Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005|work=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]],}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates contend that recycled energy costs less and has lower emissions than most other energy options in current use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recycled-energy.com/main/what_it_does.html|title=Recycled Energy Development, "What RED Does"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp. takes advantage of recycling energy in [[heat recovery ventilation]] and latent heat pump and CHCP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recyclingenergy.com RecyclingEnergy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Perhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by [[Thomas Edison]].  His 1882 Pearl Street Station, the world’s first commercial power plant, was a CHP plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|title=World’s First Commercial Power Plant Was a Cogeneration Plant|work=[[Cogeneration Technologies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities.  These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as CHP.  They even went so far as to make it illegal for non-utilities to sell power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/~finance/hearings/testimony/2007test/052407testsc.pdf
|title=Testimony of Sean Casten before Senate subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, 5/27/07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers. CHP plants proliferated, soon producing about 8 percent of all energy in the U.S.&lt;ref name="localpower.org|title=World"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.localpower.org|title=World Survey of Decentralized Energy, 5/06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.

In 2008 [[Tom Casten]], chairman of [[Recycled Energy Development]], said that "''We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry.''"&lt;ref name=npr2008may22/&gt;

Outside the U.S., energy recycling is more common. Denmark is probably the most active energy recycler, obtaining about 55% of its energy from CHP and waste heat recovery. Other large countries, including Germany, Russia, and India, also obtain a much higher share of their energy from decentralized sources.&lt;ref name="localpower.org|title=World"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr2008may22&gt;

'''Equanimity''' ([[Latin]]: ''æquanimitas'', having an even mind; ''aequus'' even; ''animus'' mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.  The [[virtue]] and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of  major religions and ancient philosophies.
{{wikt}}

==Etymology==
From Fr. ''équanimité'', from L. ''aequanimitatem'' (nom. ''aequanimitas'') "evenness of mind, calmness," from ''aequus'' "even, level" (see equal) + ''animus'' "mind, spirit" (see animus). Meaning "evenness of temper" in English is from 1610s.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व ''[[samatva]]m'' (also rendered ''samatva'' or ''samata'').&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' one reads: ''yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate''. [[Srila Prabhupada]] translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita As it Is'', A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;
                
In his book ''Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity'', [[Swami Sivananda]] states: 

"An aspirant who treads the path to ''samatvam'' must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: ''[[Viveka]]'', discrimination; ''[[vairagya]]'', dispassion; ''shadsampat'', the six virtues (''shama'', mental calmness and control; ''dama'', restraint of the senses; ''[[uparati]]'', sense withdrawal or ''[[pratyahara]]''; ''[[titiksha]]'', endurance; ''shraddha'', faith and ''[[samadhana]]'', mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, ''mumukshutva''. In order to possess the virtue of ''Samatvam'', he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career..."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3, "The Pathway to Samatvam", ''Samatvam: The Yoga of Equanimity'', Swami Sivananda Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Another Sanskrit term for equanimity is ''[[Upeksha (Indian thought)|upekṣhā]]''. This is the term used by [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' (1.33),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Commentary on the Yoga Sutras|author=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|publisher=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-13339.htm#1.33|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''upekṣhā'' is considered to be one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]], along with [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] (''maitri''), [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''karuṇā''), and [[mudita|joy]] (''mudita''). It is related to the idea of [[Vairagya]] or "dispassion". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a [[yoga]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upekshayoga.com/yoga/Principles.html Upeksha yoga]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Yoga]] traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular [[meditation]], combined with regular practice of [[pranayama]], asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.

==Stoicism==
Equanimity is a central concept in [[Stoic ethics]] and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word ''[[apatheia]]'' or ''[[ataraxia]]'' whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word ''aequanimitas''. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father [[Antoninus Pius]]'s last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon "aequanimitas" (equanimity). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Pyrrhonism==
In [[Pyrrhonism]] the term used for equanimity is ''[[ataraxia]]'', which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. 

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], [[upekkha|equanimity]] (''[[upekkhā]]'', ''upekṣhā'') is one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]] and is considered:

{{quote|Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for [[wisdom]] and [[free will|freedom]] and the protector of [[compassion]] and [[love]]. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The [[Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will."|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Equanimity|author=[[Gil Fronsdal]]|publisher=Insight Meditation Center|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/equanimity.html|date=2004-05-29|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Equanimity can also be cultivated through meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahmana|first=Metteyya|date=2016-05-14|title=NEW EQUANIMITY MEDITATION AND TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE TO TEST ITS EFFECTIVENESS|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303111890_NEW_EQUANIMITY_MEDITATION_AND_TOOLS_FROM_PSYCHOLOGY_AND_NEUROSCIENCE_TO_TEST_ITS_EFFECTIVENESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development.  The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv|Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv]].

==Christianity==
[[Samuel Johnson]] defined equanimity as "evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed." In [[Christian philosophy]], equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the [[theological virtues]] of [[gentleness]], [[contentment]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twenty Essays on the Practical Improvement of God's Providential Dispensations as Means of Moral Discipline to the Christian|publisher=RB Seeley and W Burnside|page=51|year=1838|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lFwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Johnson&amp;dq=Equanimity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The word “[[Islam]]” is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''aslama'', which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a [[Muslim]] can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.

==Baha'i Faith==
The voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than "equanimity" in the Baha'i Writings are "detachment" and "selflessness" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: "Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is written about him: "So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: "Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} He wrote: "Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world." {{Citation needed|reason=Source must be directly cited and linked to as footnote|date=June 2018}}

'''''Erased de Kooning Drawing''''' is an early work of US artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]]: an almost blank piece of paper in a simple gilded frame.  The work was created in 1953 by Rauschenberg [[eraser|erasing]] a drawing he obtained from Dutch artist [[Willem de Kooning]].  Rauschenberg asked his friend [[Jasper Johns]] to add a written caption to the frame, which reads: "Erased de Kooning Drawing, Robert Rauschenberg, 1953”.  It is considered a [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[conceptual art]]work, with similarities affinities to [[Added Art]], although with material removed from the original work rather than added.  It has been held by the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] since 1998, which describes the work as a "drawing [with] traces of drawing media on paper with label and gilded frame".

==Development==
The work is a development from Rauschenberg's early [[Monochrome painting|monochrome]] white paintings that he first created in summer 1951.  After creating a series of completely blank white paintings, Rauschenberg set out to discover whether an artwork could be produced entirely through erasure.  He started with erasing his own drawings, but felt that the result was not sufficiently creative, so he decided to seek a drawing from another more established artist - clearly already a work of art - that he could erase.  He approached de Kooning, an artist he admired, to ask for a drawing that he could erase to create a new work of art.  After some persuasion, de Kooning gave Rauschenberg a densely worked drawing in crayon, ink, pencil and charcoal, deliberately steering away from works that he did not like, or simple pencil drawings that would be too easy for Rauschenberg to erase.   It took Rauschenberg approximately two months to obliterate as much of de Kooning drawing as he could, using a variety of different erasers.  The plain gilded frame and inscription by Jasper Johns are important parts of the work: without them, a viewer would struggle to interpret the work.

==Existing copies==
No photographs exist of the de Kooning work before its erasure, but digital photographs made by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2010 enhanced the remaining traces of the underlying drawing, although some may have been erased by de Kooning as part of the initial creation of the work before he gave it to Rauschenberg. De Kooning's original drawing appears to be studio sketch, with several figures facing in different directions, including at least one female, probably made with pencil and charcoal.

==Exhibitions==
The work, including its frame, measures {{convert|25.25|*|21.75|*|0.5|in|cm}}. It was not exhibited in public until 1963, but Rauschenberg would show it to visitors to his studio, and it became well known.  Some considered the destruction of a de Kooning drawing to be an act of vandalism; others recognised the concept of Rauschenberg's new work.  It was bought by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1998 using a gift from [[Phyllis Wattis]].

== History ==
In 1973, feminist scholar [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] wrote an influential essay, ''The Rhetoric of Women’s Liberation: An Oxymoron'', that drew feminists' attention to women's role as communicators within rhetorical frameworks, and to the relevance of feminist theory to the study of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer | first=Michaela D. E. | title=Women Speak(ing): Forty Years of Feminist Contributions to Rhetoric and an Agenda for Feminist Rhetorical Studies | journal=Communication Quarterly | volume=55 | issue=1 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0146-3373 | doi=10.1080/01463370600998293 | pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar [[Patricia Bizzell]] noted in 1992 that classical canon of rhetoric consists almost entirely of well-educated male authors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bizzell|first1=Patricia|date=1992|title=Opportunities for Feminist Research in the History of Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feminist rhetoric scholars argued that the world of rhetoric was suffused with patriarchal values. To address this perceived problem, they made efforts to include women authors in the history of rhetoric; pointed out connections between feminist issues and theories of rhetoric; and wrote rhetorical criticism from feminist perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-feminist-rhetoric-1690791|title=Feminist Rhetoric|last1=Nordquist|first1=Richard|website=Thought Co.|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These academics were initially inspired by feminist scholarship outside of rhetoric and composition studies, but eventually developed a distinctive school within this tradition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the initial feminist rhetoric movement, the Coalition of Women (later Feminist) Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition was formed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to its mission statement, this coalition “fosters inquiry in the histories, theories, and pedagogues of rhetoric and composition” for the "advancement of feminist research".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwshrc.org/about-us/our-mission/|title=Our Mission|website=Coalition of Feminist Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of teachers and scholars dedicated to promoting the [[intersectionality]] of communication and collaboration within feminist rhetoric and research methods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Founding members included Winifred Horner, Jan Swearingen, Nan Johnson, Marjone Curry Woods, and Kathleen Welch.&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ratcliffe |first= Krista |chapter=The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries |title=Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric: A Twenty-First Century Guide|editor1=Lynée Lewis Gaillet |editor2=Winifred Bryan Horner |publisher=University of Missouri Press|date=2010 |pages=185–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues with [[Andrea Lunsford]], Jackie Royster, [[Cheryl Glenn (academic)|Cheryl Glenn]], Shirley Logan, and other contemporary feminist writing scholars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 1996 brought the publication of ''Peitho'', the coalition’s newspaper, published by [[Susan Jarratt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In present day feminist rhetoric, a point of emphasis is changing research methods and methodologies to include the discourse of marginalized groups.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Feminist rhetoric works to expand the rhetorical canon. The rhetorical canon is traditionally composed of five parts: Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Canons/Canons.htm|title=the canons of rhetoric|website=rhetoric.byu.edu|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced by the Roman orator [[Cicero]] in his treatise ''De Inventione'' around 50 BC. The idea was expanded by the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] 150 years later in ''Institutio Oratoria.'' The rhetorical canon has been used in rhetorical education since its creation. Rhetorical treatises have based their purpose off these canons. Rhetoric is integrated in the education system, which means that students are taught the rhetorical canon as well. Feminist rhetoric scholars argue that this canon, and its methods of persuasion or argument, exclude some valuable forms of public discourse and narrative, and seek to expand it accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Methodology in rhetoric studies ===
Scholars, such as Jessica Enoch and Jaqueline Jones Royster, introduced the idea of changing the way research is recognized and constructed. Scholars in rhetoric studies agree there is a plethora of voices and demographics to draw upon for data necessary for research in the field.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enoch|first=Jessica|date=2004|title="Para La Mujer": Defining a Chicana Feminist Rhetoric at the Turn of the Century|url=|journal=College English|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest this is achieved by asking questions that have never been asked before, recognizing the wealth of materials (or lack thereof) in archives, and expanding the idea of an archive.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In recent years, archives have been deconstructed, or critically analyzed, outside of scholarly articles. Feminist rhetorical academics work to develop research methods and methodologies by including new types of archival research such as- yearbooks, small town newspapers, and community contributing archival websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lueck|first=Amy|date=2017|title=Classbook Sense': Genre and Girls' School Yearbooks in the Early-Twenties- Century American High School|url=|journal=College English|volume=79.4|pages=358–383|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global narratives ===
Another main idea in feminist rhetoric is making the point of view, and the rhetorical canon, more expansive than what lies within the United States' domain of discourse.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: New Horizons for  Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies|last1=Royster|first1=Jacqueline Jones|last2=Kirsch|first2=Gesa E.|date=2012|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric scholars ask the questions of how rhetoric, writing studies, and social change intersect, or may be influenced by politics, the economy, religions, cultures, and education.&lt;ref name="Kirsh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Gesa E.|last2=Royster|first2=Jacqueline J.|date=2010|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: In Search of Excellence|jstor=27917867|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=61|issue=4|pages=640–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key term used in this field is "[[transnationality]]", defined as the culture of one nation moving through borders to another nation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is used with the terms cultural hybridity and intertextuality, which continue the theory of cultures, texts, and ideas mixing with one another.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Feminist rhetoric works to represent the voices and discourse of genders that go beyond the binary of male and female. [[Transgender]] discourse is another main point of focus in feminist rhetoric, which is recognized by scholars as a lack of privilege some authors have.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rawson|first1=K.J.|last2=Ronald|first2=Kate|date=2010|title=Queering Feminist Rhetorical Canonization|journal=Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies|pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royster and others have called for research focused on how gender dynamics affect communication, including rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity ===
[[Race and ethnicity]] is an area of focus for several scholars in feminist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have changed research methods to include international races and ethnicity outside the typical rhetoric canon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric focuses on how archiving cultural rhetoric, such as that of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women, can create a better understanding of the pedagogy of research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webber|first=Jim|date=2008-10-14|title=A Review of: "Refiguring Rhetorical Education: Women Teaching African American, Native American, and Chicano/a Students, 1865–1911, by Jessica Enoch."|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=467–469|doi=10.1080/02773940802405546|issn=0277-3945}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen in feminist rhetoric is the discourse of colored women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some female scholars of color have written about their perceived need to mask their identity when sharing their voices and opinions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Sano-Franchini, Jennifer, Donnie Sackey and Stacey Pigg. “Methodological Dwellings: A Search for Feminisms in Rhetoric &amp; Composition.” Present Tense, Vol. 1, Issue 2. Michigan State Univ. Press. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric theory works to legitimize the ethnic discourse of women and give it a platform in the academia of rhetoric and writing studies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Challenges ==
Feminist rhetoric scholars have noted the difficulty in including diverse voices in the rhetorical canon.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Scholars have argued that changes in research methods may be needed to better include the voices of those who are disabled, trans, and [[queer]] in rhetoric studies.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dolmage, Jay, et al. “Refiguring Rhetorica: Linking Feminist Rhetoric and Disability Studies.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 23–38. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite longstanding feminist opposition to processes of canonization as inherently imposing limits and excluding perspectives, feminist rhetoric has begun to develop its own canon of commonly referenced texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accordingly, feminist rhetoric scholars try to include the works of unknown feminist rhetors in their theorization processes, and develop a gendered analysis or approach that actively includes rhetors who are traditionally excluded from rhetorical canons, such as women of color or low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Rhetors, along with expanding the feminist rhetorical canon, work to make feminist rhetoric applicable in pedagogy and education. Scholars discuss the importance of research, whether that be changing research methods or looking further into textual research.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some suggest this can be done by theorizing, others want to employ critical imagination.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Addison, Joanne, and Kate Ronald. “Researching Literacy as a Lived Experience.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 136–151.

Critical imagination is using the silence, or lack of work from feminist rhetors, to extrapolate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Scholars discuss how this involves understanding that there is more to not only feminist rhetoric, but feminist practice in theory, than what is written down in textbooks or history. Scholars, such as Royster and Kirsch, acknowledge that feminist rhetoric needs to draw from the silence to help set a new precedent for rhetorical practices in the future.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A part of critical imagination is knowing that the documentation of rhetoric thus far isn’t the only important rhetoric that should contribute to pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Eves, Rosalyn. “Landmark Essays on Rhetoric and Feminism, 1973–2000 ed. by Cheryl Glenn and Andrea Lunsford (Review)” ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'', Volume 19, Number 4. pp. 705-708.

The '''''{{lang|la|fiscus Iudaicus}}''''' ([[Latin]] for "Jewish tax") or '''''{{lang|la|fiscus Judaicus}}''''' was a tax-collecting agency instituted to collect the [[Roman Empire#Taxation|tax]] imposed on [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews in the Roman Empire]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in AD 70]]. Revenues were directed to the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

==Imposition==
{{Taxation}}
The tax was initially imposed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] as one of the [[Anti-Judaism|measures against Jews]] as a result of the [[First Roman-Jewish War]] of 66–73 AD (first Jewish revolt) (Josephus ''BJ'' 7. 218; Dio Cassius 66.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 AD in place of the levy (or [[Tithe]]) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two [[denarius|denarii]], equivalent to the one-half of a [[shekel]] that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Exodus|30:13|HE}}). The tax was to go instead to the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], the major center of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a humiliation for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6157-fiscus-judaicus Jewish Encyclopedia: Fiscus Judaicus]: "This was an affront to Jewish religious feeling."&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, a special [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] known as ''procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum'' was responsible for the collection of the tax.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.

While the tax paid for the Temple of Jerusalem was payable only by adult men between the ages of 20 and 50, the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was imposed on all Jews, including women, children, and elderly&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer (1998), pp. 113&amp;ndash;114&lt;/ref&gt;—and even Jewish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Heemstra, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], the documentary evidence (in the form of receipts) confirms the payment of the tax by women and children. The oldest person known from these receipts to have paid the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a 61-year-old woman, which led Sherman LeRoy Wallace to conjecture that the tax was levied only until the age of 62, as was the regular [[Roman Empire#Taxation|Roman poll tax]] paid by individuals throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Heemstra, p. 14 (footnote n. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was continued even after the completion of the reconstruction of the Capitoline temple for its upkeep.

==Domitian==
[[Domitian]], who ruled between 81 and 96 AD, expanded the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' to include not only born Jews and [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]], but also on those who concealed the fact that they were Jews or observed Jewish customs. [[Suetonius]] relates that when he was an old man of 90 he was examined to see whether he was [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]], which shows that during this period the tax was levied even on those above the age of 62.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"/&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] argues that the increased harshness was caused by the success of the Jewish (and possibly [[Early Christianity|Christian]]) [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (1993), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian applied the tax even to those who merely [[Judaizers|"lived like Jews"]]:

{{quote|Besides other taxes, that on the Jews [A tax of two drachmas a head, imposed by Vespasian; see Josephus, Bell. Jud. 7.218] was levied with the utmost rigor, and those were prosecuted who, without publicly acknowledging that faith, yet lived as Jews, as well as those who concealed their origin and did not pay the tribute levied upon their people [These may have been Christians, whom the Romans commonly assumed were Jews]. I recall being present in my youth when the person of a man ninety years old was examined before the procurator and a very crowded court, to see whether he was circumcised. [{{circa}} 90]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=183&amp;letter=F&amp;search=Fiscus%20Iudaicus Jewish Encyclopedia: Fiscus Iudaicus], [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-domitian-rolfe.html Suetonius's ''Domitian''] XII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Domitian's ruling opened the door to possibilities of [[blackmail]] in Rome and in all [[Italy]]. Charges of following Judaism were easily made, but difficult to disprove, not least because the practices of certain philosophical sects resembled some Jewish customs. As a result, many people chose to settle with the accusers out of court rather than risk the uncertainties of judicial hearings, thus effectively encouraging the blackmailers.&lt;ref&gt;Rodin (1915), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] was put to death for "living a Jewish life" or "drifting into Jewish ways" in the year 95 AD, which may well have been related to the administration of the ''fiscus Judaicus'' under Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 67.14.1–2, 68.1.2; ''History of the Jewish People'', H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, page 322: "...Domitian ordered the execution of Flavius Clemens ... for [[Judaizing]] tendencies..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schism between Judaism and Christianity==
{{See also|List of events in early Christianity|l1=List of events marking changes in the relations between Christians and Jews in early Christianity}}

The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was originally imposed on Jews. At the time neither the Romans nor, probably, the [[Early Christian]]s considered Christianity to be a separate religion from Judaism. If anything they would have considered themselves as a sect within Judaism, which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Bourgel, Jonathan, ″The Jewish Christians and the Jewish tax ″, in: ''From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome (66-135/6 EC)''. Paris: Éditions du Cerf, collection Judaïsme ancien et Christianisme primitive, (French), pp. 105-125.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether that was the intention or not, it did not take long for Christians to petition the Emperor to distinguish the Christians for the purpose of the payment of the ''fiscus Iudaicus''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} As the tax only applied to practising Jews, if they could be recognised as a separate religion, they would escape the impost.

After the murder of Domitian in 96 AD, [[Nerva]] relaxed the rules of collection, limiting the tax to those who openly practised Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1996), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; By this measure, the Christians (and perhaps [[Jewish Christians]]) escaped the tax [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Ancient/IntergroupTO/Schism.htm]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}, but they were not officially recognized as a legal religion until the much later [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. The coins of Nerva bear the legend ''fisci Iudaici [[Calumnia (Roman law)|calumnia]] sublata''&lt;ref&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''; Rodin (1915), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; "abolition of [[malicious prosecution]] in connection with the Jewish tax,"&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Molly Whittaker, ''Jews and Christians: Graeco-Roman Views'', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to his reform of the harsh policies of [[Domitian]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Goodman (historian)|Martin Goodman]], "Nerva, the ''Fiscus Judaicus'' and Jewish Identity," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 79 (1989) 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==

It remains unclear when exactly the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was abolished. Documentary evidence confirms the collection of the tax in the middle of the 2nd century, and literary sources indicate that the tax was still in existence in the early 3rd century. It is not known when the tax was formally abolished. Some historians credit the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] with its abolition in about 361 or 362.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html Julian and the Jews (361-363 CE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval revival ==

The tax was revived in the [[Middle Ages]] in 1342 under the name of [[Opferpfennig]] by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. The Opferpfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor [[Louis IV the Bavarian]], who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. The practice was justified on the grounds that the emperor, as the legal successor of the Roman emperors, was the rightful recipient of the [[Taxation of the Jews|Temple tax]] which Jews paid to the Romans after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. The Opferpfennig was collected on [[Christmas]] day.

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] later ordered the income of the Opferpfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of [[Trier]]. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15120.html OPFERPFENNIG. Encyclopaedia Judaica]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JBS Haldane 1964 India - a cropped image.JPG|thumb|right|220px|J. B. S. Haldane]]

'''Haldane's dilemma''' is a limit on the speed of beneficial [[evolution]], first calculated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1957, and clarified further by later commentators. 

== Substitution cost ==

In the introduction to ''The Cost of Natural Selection'' Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, writes Haldane,&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = J.B.S. | year = | title = The Cost of Natural Selection | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf| journal = J. Genet | volume = 55 | issue = 511–524| page = 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.

Haldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. [[Genetic correlation|Characters that are positively correlated]] at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimisation of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the [[peppered moth]], ''Biston betularia'', whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several [[alleles]] at a single gene.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;ref name="majerus1998"&gt;Majerus, M.E.N. (1998) ''[[Melanism: Evolution in Action]]''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these alleles, "C", is dominant to all the others, and any '''CC''' or  '''Cx''' moths are dark (where "x" is any other allele). Another allele, "c", is recessive to all the others, and '''cc''' moths are light. Against the originally pale [[lichen]]s the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the '''cc''' moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of '''cc''' moths might be halved.

Another potential problem is that if "ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only &lt;math&gt;(1/2)^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived." The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== Selection intensity ==

Haldane proceeds to define the ''intensity of selection'' regarding "juvenile survival" (that is, survival to reproductive age) as &lt;math&gt;I = \ln (s_0/S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of those with the optimal genotype (or genotype) that survive to reproduce, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient for the entire population. The quotient of deaths &lt;math&gt;1-S&lt;/math&gt; for the entire population would have been &lt;math&gt;1-s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal, hence &lt;math&gt;s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if &lt;math&gt;s_0 \approx S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;I \approx s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; – since ln(1) = 0.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== The cost ==

Haldane writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus is responsible for &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be &lt;math&gt;\prod \left( 1- d_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; of that of the optimal genotype, or &lt;math&gt;\exp \left ( -\sum d_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; nearly, if every &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to &lt;math&gt;\sum d_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing to the above, we have that &lt;math&gt;d_i = s_{0i} - S&lt;/math&gt;, if we say that &lt;math&gt;s_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.

The problem statement is therefore that the [[allele]]s in question are ''not'' particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.

The total cost of substitution of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; gene is the sum &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; of all values of &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; depends mainly on &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== A mathematical model of the cost of diploids ==
Let '''A''' and '''a''' be two alleles with frequencies &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation. Their relative fitness is given by&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|-
| width=100 | Genotype
| width=70 | '''AA'''
| width=70 | '''Aa'''
| width=70 | '''aa'''
|-
| Frequency
| &lt;math&gt;p_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2p_nq_n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Fitness
| 1
| &lt;math&gt;1 - \lambda K&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 - K&lt;/math&gt;
|}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

If λ = 0, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''AA''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''AA''' ('''A''' dominant), and if λ = 1, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''aa''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''aa''' ('''A''' recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness '''Aa''' is to '''aa'''.

The fraction of selective deaths in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation then is

: &lt;math&gt;d_n = 2\lambda Kp_nq_n + Kq_n^2 = Kq_n[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by

: &lt;math&gt;D =  K \sum_0^\infin q_n \; [2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n].&lt;/math&gt;

== Important number 300 ==
Haldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt; This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form

:&lt;math&gt; dq_n=-Kp_n q_n[\lambda + (1-2 \lambda  )q_n ] &lt;/math&gt;
substituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, 'D', required to make a substitution) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}{(1 - q)[\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}dq = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{\lambda(1 - 2\lambda)}{\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q}\right]dq.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming λ &amp;lt; 1, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda - (1 - 2\lambda) p_0}{\lambda}\right)\right] \approx \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda}{\lambda}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the last approximation assumes &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; to be small.

If λ = 1, then we have

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{2 - q}{(1 - q)^2} = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{1}{(1 - q)^2}\right]dq = p_0^{-1} - \mbox{ ln } p_0 + O(\lambda K).&lt;/math&gt;

In his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, "usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation" – the minimum being the population size (= "the number in a generation") and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

Assuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over ''n'' generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/''n'', so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of ''n'' = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of &lt;math&gt;I = 30/300 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

Haldane then continues:&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane's calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.

== Origin of the term "Haldane's dilemma" ==
Apparently the first use of the term "Haldane's dilemma" was by palaeontologist [[Leigh Van Valen]] in his 1963 paper "Haldane's Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis".

Van Valen writes:&lt;ref name=VanValen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Valen | first1 = Leigh | year = 1963 | title = Haldane's Dilemma, evolutionary rates, and heterosis | url = | journal = Amer. Nat | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 185–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Haldane (1957 [= ''The Cost of Natural Selection'']) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.&lt;ref name=VanValen/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are ''N'' such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.

In 1967 J. A. Sved found that the dilemma was based on wrong calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Donald |first=Peter |date=1969 |title=" Haldane's dilemma" and the rate of natural selection |journal=Nature |volume=221 | issue = 5183  |page=815 |pmid=5675622 |doi=10.1038/221815a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Human Rights Logo''' has its origin in the international "Logo for Human Rights" initiative, which was started in 2010. Its goal was to create an internationally recognized [[logo]] to support the [[Human rights|global human rights movement]]. The winning logo was created by Predrag Stakić from [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15412732,00.html | title=Serbian designer wins competition for a global human rights logo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The winning logo==
The Human Rights Logo combines the silhouette of a hand with that of a bird, and a white thumb grabbing the bird. It is intended as a peaceful contribution towards strengthening human rights and as such is meant to be used across cultural and language borders. The logo is now available to everyone at no cost as an open source product. It is free from rights and can be used worldwide by everyone without paying fees or obtaining licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jana |first=Reena |url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/design-architecture/a-logo-for-human-rights/497 |title=A logo for human rights |publisher=SmartPlanet |date=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The competition==
The goal of the Logo for Human Rights initiative was to create an internationally recognized symbol for human rights. To this end, an international online design competition starting on 3 May 2011 ([[World Press Freedom Day]]) launched a global appeal for submissions of logo designs and put them to a vote. The competition until today is known as one of the largest, most complex creative [[crowdsourcing]] projects ever conducted.

From the more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries a collective decision by all participants selected the top ten logos. After which an international jury decided on the top ten logos.&lt;ref name="diplo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kampala.diplo.de/Vertretung/kampala/en/Seite__Human_20Rights_20Logo.html |title=German Embassy Kampala - A Logo for Human Rights |publisher=Kampala.diplo.de |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these 10 logos, the internet community selected a winner within a three-week voting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/a-logo-for-human-rights |title=A Logo for Human Rights |publisher=Ishr.ch |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502105931/http://www.ishr.ch/a-logo-for-human-rights |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The competition officially ended on 23 September with the presentation of the universal logo for human rights during [[UN General Assembly]] week in [[New York City]].

==Presentation of the winning logo==
The presentation of the winning logo took place on 23 September 2011 in New York, with former editor-in-chief of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' [[Michael Elliott (editor)|Michael Elliott]] hosting the event.
In speeches, television journalist [[Ann Curry]] and German Federal Foreign Minister [[Guido Westerwelle]], as well as human rights activists [[Carolyn Gomes]] from [[Jamaica]] and Angelina Atyam from [[Uganda]], emphasized the importance of a universal symbol in the worldwide struggle for human rights. The musical highlight of the evening was a performance by soprano [[Jessye Norman]].

==The jury==
The initiative is supported by a jury of renowned and high-ranking personalities, who have worked to further the cause of human rights. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanrightslogo.net | title=Human Rights Logo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Pollution from a factory]]
'''I = PAT''' is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the [[human impacts on the environment|impact of human activity on the environment]].

:'''I''' = '''P''' × '''A''' × '''T'''

The expression equates [[Environmental issue|human impact on the environment]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of three [[independent variable|factors]]: [[World population|Population]], [[Affluence]], and [[Technology]]. It is similar in form to the [[Kaya identity]] which applies specifically to emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]].

The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions.

==History==
The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]]. Commoner argued that [[environmental impact]]s in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following [[World War II]] and aimed his thoughts on present day deteriorating environmental conditions in the U.S. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human [[population growth]], but focused more on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time.&lt;ref name ="End of Population Growth"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = B.C. |last2 = MacKellar | first2 = F.L. | first3 = W.| last3= Lutz | date = 2004 | chapter = Population, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change | title = The End of World Population Growth in the 21st Century: New Challenges for Human Capital Formation &amp; Sustainable Development | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Lutz | editor2-first = W.C. | editor2-last= Sanderson | editor3-first= S. | editor3-last = Scherbov | publisher = Earthscan Press | location = London | pages = 283–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehrlich  | first1 = Paul R.  | authorlink1 = Paul R.

The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chertow | first1 = M. R. | authorlink1 = Marian Chertow| title = The IPAT Equation and Its Variants | doi = 10.1162/10881980052541927 | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 13–29 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], [[George Wald]], [[Denis Hayes]], [[Lester R. Brown|Lester Brown]], [[René Dubos]], and [[Sidney Dillon Ripley|Sidney Ripley]] that did not come to pass.&lt;ref name="bailey_2000"&gt;[[Ronald Bailey|R Bailey]] (2000) ''Earth day then and now'', [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] '''32'''(1), 18-28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Koblitz]] classified equations of this type as "mathematical [[propaganda]]" and criticized Ehrlich's use of them in the media (e.g. on [[The Tonight Show]]) to sway the general public.&lt;ref name="koblitz_1981"&gt;[[Neal Koblitz|N Koblitz]] (1981) "Mathematics as Propaganda", in ''Mathematics Tomorrow'', ed. [[Lynn Steen]], pp 111-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dependent variable: Impact==
&lt;!-- A definition of impact was missing. Added here.  --&gt;

The variable "I" in the "I=PAT" equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can sustain a certain level of impact sustainably. The maximum sustainable impact is called the [[carrying capacity]]. As long as "I" is less than this amount the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up "I" are sustainable. If "I" exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]], which can only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to sustain impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity.

Impact may be measured using [[ecological footprint]] analysis in units of [[global hectares]] (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of  Earth's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita.

Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers, therefore Affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency  factor.

==The three factors==
===Population===
{{See also|World population|Human overpopulation}}

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|Population (est.) 10,000 BC – 2000 AD.]]

In the '''I=PAT''' equation, the variable '''P''' represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and many others{{Who|date=February 2011}} to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see [[Malthusian growth model]]).

The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.6 billion today (2018) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=Population Prospects 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of [[demographic transition]] all over the world. The UN projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion in 2100 (up from 9.2 billion).&lt;ref name="End of Population Growth"/&gt; However, since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades, this factor of the '''I=PAT''' equation will likely keep increasing [[human impact on the environment]] for the near future.

====Environmental impacts of population====
Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:

* Increased [[land use]] - Results in habitat loss for other species.
* Increased [[resource use]] - Results in changes in land cover
* Increased [[pollution]] - Can cause sickness and damages [[ecosystem]]s.

===Affluence===
{{Main|Consumption (economics)}}

[[File:World GDP Capita 1-2003 A.D.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|World GDP per capita (in 1990 [[Geary-Khamis dollars]])]]

The variable '''A''', in the '''I=PAT''' equation stands for [[affluence]]. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through [[GDP per capita]]. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases.  GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the '''I=PAT''' equation.

====Environmental impacts of affluence====
&lt;!-- Not a great example - needs fleshing out; number of automobiles per capita would be a better example, as it changes, ... --&gt;

Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts:

* 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires&lt;ref name ="Phillis"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andriantiatsaholiniaina | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Kouikoglou | first2 = V. S. | last3 = Phillis | first3 = Y. A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.009 | title = Evaluating strategies for sustainable development: Fuzzy logic reasoning and sensitivity analysis |journal = [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]| volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 682&amp;nbsp;lbs. of pollution at a mine for the [[lead battery]].&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;
* 2178&amp;nbsp;lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22&amp;nbsp;lbs. of copper contained in the car.&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;

The more cars per capita, the greater the impact.
Ecological impacts of each product are far reaching, increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources.

===Technology===
{{See also|Environmental technology|Appropriate technology}}

The '''T''' variable in the '''I=PAT''' equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used.  Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier.  Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for '''T''' is often tailored for the situation '''I=PAT''' is being applied to. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for '''T''' might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.

====Environmental impacts of technology====
Increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact. However, since '''P''' has increased exponentially, and '''A''' has also increased drastically, the overall environmental impact, '''I''', has still increased.

==Criticism==
[[File:Native American fishing at Willamette Falls.jpg|thumb|Native American Fishing Practices (Low Technology) have a vastly smaller Impact than Industrialized Fishing]]
Criticisms of the "I=PAT" formula
* Too Simplistic for complex problem
* Inter dependencies between variables
* General sweeping assumptions of variables’ effect toward environmental impact
* Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact
* Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one’s view of the situation

===Interdependencies===
The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least 7 interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T).&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alcott | first1 = B. | title = Impact caps: Why population, affluence and technology strategies should be abandoned | doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.08.001 | journal = [[Journal of Cleaner Production]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–560 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]].  As was shown by Alcott,&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010" /&gt;{{rp|Fig. 5}} despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A.

===Neglect of beneficial human impacts===
There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] or [[Environmental restoration|restoration]] efforts that societies have made.&lt;ref name=moseley242&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography: Local Dynamics and Global Processes |last=Moseley |first=William |last2=Perramond |first2=Eric |last3=Hapke |first3=Holly |last4=Laris |first4=Paul |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2014 |isbn=9781405189316 |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of political and social contexts===
Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low impact practices.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; However, the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (ie resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Primitive polluters : Semang impact on the Malaysian tropical rain forest ecosystem |last=Rambo |first=A. Terry |date=1985 |publisher=Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan |isbn=0915703041 |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |oclc=13516436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ecological Indian : myth and history |last=Krech |first=Shepard, III |date=1999 |publisher=W.W.

In fact the generally low impact of small scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their ''inability'' to significantly affect their environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eric Alden|last2=Wishnie|first2=Mark|date=2000|title=Conservation and Subsistence in Small-Scale Societies|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=493–524|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hames|first=Raymond|date=2007|title=The Ecologically Noble Savage Debate|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=177–190 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren's 1972 dialogue with Commoner in ''The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''&lt;ref name=BAS1/&gt; where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren's 1993 paper, ''A Brief History of "IPAT"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/review-anthrozoology/|title=Paul Ehrlich reviews Tobias and Morrison’s most recent book –“Anthrozoology: Embracing Co-Existence in the Anthropocene” |date=2017-01-31|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Policy implications===
As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., [[population control]] and material sufficiency and [[degrowth]] movements have been very controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or [[Pigovian tax|Pigouvian taxation]] of resource use or pollution.&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5192">'''Ignorance management''' is a [[knowledge management]] practice that addresses the concept of [[ignorance]] in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-28041426/how-to-manage-ignorance-inside-the-book-peter-drucker-never-wrote/ | title=How to Manage Ignorance; Inside the Book Peter Drucker Never Wrote | publisher=[http://www.cbsnews.com CBS News] | date=December 12, 2007 | accessdate=April 25, 2012 | author=Deschene, Lori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Ignorance Management has been described by John Israilidis, Russell Lock, and Louise Cooke of [[Loughborough University]] as:

{{quote|"[...] a [[Business process|process]] of discovering, exploring, realising, recognising and managing ignorance outside and inside the organisation through an appropriate management process to meet current and future demands, design better policy and modify actions in order to achieve organisational [[Goal|objectives]] and sustain [[competitive advantage]]."&lt;ref&gt;Israilidis, J.; Lock, R.; Cooke, L. (2012) Ignorance Management: An Alternative Perspective on Knowledge Management in Multinational Organisations. In ''Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Knowledge Management'', Cartagena, Spain, 6–7 September, pp.493-501, {{ISBN|978-1-908272-63-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The key principle of this [[theory]] is that knowledge management (KM) could better be seen as Ignorance Management due to the fact that it is impossible for someone to comprehend and understand everything in a complete way. The only real wisdom is in recognising the limits and extent of one's [[knowledge]] and therefore, KM is essentially a matter of sharing the extent of one's ignorance with other people, and thus learning together. This process of knowing what is needed to know and also acknowledging the power of understanding the [[Unknown known|unknown]], could develop a [[Tacit knowledge|tacit]] understanding and could improve both short-term opportunistic value capture and longer term business sustainability (Israilidis et al. 2012).

==Research==
Several attempts have been made to explore the value of managing organisational ignorance in order to prevent failures within [[knowledge transfer]] contexts. The need to recognise the role and significance of power in the management of ignorance has been introduced to further enhance such efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J. (2009) From Knowledge Management to Ignorance Management. In ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Organizational Learning Knowledge and Capabilities'', Amsterdam, Netherlands, 26–28 April.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a growing body of psychology research shows that humans find it intrinsically difficult to get a sense of what we don’t know and argues that incompetence deprives people of the ability to recognise their own incompetence (the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wolchover, N. (2012) [https://news.yahoo.com/incompetent-people-too-ignorant-know-175402902.html Incompetent People Too Ignorant to Know It]. Retrieved 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the viewpoint of developing our understanding of organisational ignorance can yield impressive benefits, if successfully incorporated within a company’s KM strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Zack, M. (1999) Managing Organizational Ignorance. ''Knowledge Directions'', Volume 1, pp. 36-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">'''Industrial metabolism''' is a concept to describe the material and energy turnover of industrial systems. It was proposed by [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]] in analogy to the biological [[metabolism]] as "the whole integrated collection of physical processes that convert [[raw material]]s and [[energy]], plus [[Manual labour|labour]], into finished [[product (business)|product]]s and [[waste]]s..."&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U., 1994. Industrial metabolism: Theory and policy. In: Ayres, R.U., Simonis, U.K. (Eds.), [http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80841e/80841E00.htm Industrial Metabolism: Restructuring for Sustainable Development]. United Nations University Press, Tokyo, pp. 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In analogy to the biological concept of metabolism, which is used to describe the whole of chemical reactions in, for example, a cell to maintain its functions and reproduce itself, the concept of industrial metabolism describes the chemical reactions, transport processes, and manufacturing activities in industry. Industrial metabolism presupposes a connection between different industrial activities by seeing them as part of a larger system, such as a material cycle or the supply chain of a commodity. System scientists, for example in [[industrial ecology]], use the concept as paradigm to study the [[material flow|flow of materials]] or energy through the industrial system in order to better understand [[supply chain|supply chains]], the sources and causes of [[pollutant|emissions]], and the linkages between the industrial and the wider [[socio-technological]] system.&lt;ref&gt;S. Anderberg (1998), "Industrial metabolism and linkages between economics, ethics, and the environment", ''Ecological Economics'', 24, pp 311-320&lt;/ref&gt; 

Industrial metabolism is a subsystem of the [[Anthropogenic metabolism|anthropogenic]] or socioeconomic metabolism, which also comprises non-industrial human activities in households or the public sector.

The '''[http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/Upload/Documents/FINAL_WEB_POLICY_FRAMEWORK_30_NOV_2015.pdf Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (IPFSD)]''' is a dynamic document created to help governments formulate sound investment policy, especially [[international investment agreement]]s (IIAs), that capitalize on [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) for [[sustainable development]]. It was prepared by the Division on Investment and Enterprise (DIAE) of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). IPFSD is not a negotiated text or undertaking between States; but rather an initiative by the UNCTAD Secretariat that represents expert guidance while leaving domestic policy makers free to ''adapt and adopt.'' IPFSD is the result of numerous consultations with experts and is intended as a platform to provide for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders. The main objective of the IPFSD is to create a balance between the rights and obligations of States and investors while maintaining attractive investment environments.

In the face of persistent global economic and social challenges, UNCTAD's IPFSD intends to:

*Promote a new generation of investment agreements by pursuing a broader development agenda; and
*Offer guidance to policymakers when formulating their national and international investment policies.

To that end, IPFSD defines eleven critical Core Principles. Flowing from these Core Principles IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policy including clause-by-clause options for negotiators to enhance the [[sustainable development]] value of domestic investment policies.

== Background to the IPFSD ==

IPFSD has grown out of a long precedent of [[UN]] Member States calling for sustainable economic development, an understanding that investment is a critical aspect of [[sustainable development]], and UNCTAD's three-and-a-half decades of experience in research and policy analysis.

The [[UN Charter]] promotes, ''inter alia'', the goal of economic and social progress. The [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) call for a Global Partnership for Development. In particular, Goal 8 encourages the further development of an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system, which includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction, both nationally and internationally- concepts that apply equally to the investment system. The “Monterrey Consensus” of the UN Conference on Financing for Development 2002, acknowledges that countries need to continue their efforts to achieve a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate. The UN Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of September 2002, following up on the Rio Declaration, calls for the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for [[sustainable development]], which integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The 4th UN Conference on [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs) in May 2011 adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action with a strong focus on productive capacity building and structural transformation as core elements to achieve more robust, balanced, equitable, and inclusive sustainable development. Finally, the 2012 UNCTAD XIII Conference recognized the role of FDI in sustainable development and inclusive growth.

Several other international instruments inspired the Core Principles that make up the IPFSD. They comprise, in particular, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], the Convention on the Establishment of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the [[World Bank]] Guidelines, the [[UN Global Compact]] and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and social policy and several [[WTO]]-related agreements, including the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], the [[TRIMs]] Agreement and the Agreement on Government Procurement.

== Structure and components of the IPFSD ==
[[File:IPFSD Structure.jpg|450px|thumbnail|right]]
The IPFSD consists of eleven core principles which aim to guide the investment policy underlying IIAs. Flowing from these core principles, the IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policies. The IPFSD proposes clause-by-clause options for negotiators to strengthen the [[sustainable development]] aspects of IIAs.

IPFSD also offers an interactive online platform giving stakeholders the opportunity to critically assess policy guidelines and recommend any appropriate changes.

=== The Core Principles ===

The eleven core principles of the IPFSD are:
 
# Investment for sustainable development
# 
# Policy coherence
# 
# Public governance and institutions
# 
# Dynamic Policymaking
# 
# Balanced rights and obligations
# 
# Right to regulate
# 
# Openness to investment
# 
# Investment protection and treatment 
# 
# Investment promotion and facilitation
# 
# Corporate governance and responsibility 
# 
# International cooperation

=== National Investment Policy: Guidelines ===
The national investment policy guidelines translate the core principles for investment policy making into concrete guidelines at the national level, with a view to addressing specific policy changes. 
These guidelines are designed to ensure that investment policy is coherent with the overarching development strategy of countries, enhance the sustainable development impact of investment and promote responsible investment. The guidelines further aim to balance maximizing sustainable development outcomes while maintaining an attractive investment climate. 
The national investment policy guidelines targets policy action at three levels:

*''Strategic'' – policymakers should ground investment policy in a broad roadmap for economic growth and sustainable development, such as those set out in formal economic or industrial development strategies in many countries.
*''Normative'' – by setting rules and regulations on investment and in a range of other policy areas, policymakers can promote and regulate investment that is geared towards sustainable development goals.
*''Administrative'' – through appropriate implementation and institutional mechanisms, policymakers can ensure continued relevance and effectiveness of investment policies.

=== International Investment Agreements (IIAs):  Policy Options ===

The IPFSD aims to translate the Core Principles into concrete options for policymakers with a view to addressing today’s investment challenges by providing examples of how to draft IIAs that address sustainable development by strengthening development dimensions of IIAs, balancing the rights and obligations of States and investors, and managing the systematic complexity of the IIA regime. International investment policy must be addressed at three levels.

*''Strategic'' – this involves managing the interaction between IIAs and national policies, and those between IIAs and other international agreements e.g. human rights obligations.  The overall objective is to ensure coherence between IIAs and sustainable development goals.
*''Designing provisions for sustainable development''– this concerns addressing the policy space and balancing rights and obligations between States and investors, and effective investment promotion.
*''Building multilateral consensus on investment policy'' – this goes toward helping address the systemic challenges that emerge from overlaps and inconsistencies in the IIA regime.

The IPFSD suggests, clause-by-clause, how the IPFSD's Core Principles can be converted into concrete provisions in an IIA. Governments can choose from these explicit policy options those that best suit their countries’ levels of development and respective policy objectives.  Among others these include: adjustments of existing IIA provisions(e.g. making them more [[sustainable development]]-friendly through formulations that safeguard policy space and limit State liability); new provisions in IIAs (e.g. to balance investor rights and responsibilities and to promote responsible investment); and the introduction of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) (e.g. clauses for less-developed Parties to calibrate the level of obligations to the country’s level of development).

Some specific clause-level recommendations include:

*Narrowing the scope-and-definition clause to exclude portfolio, short-term or speculative investments from treaty coverage;
*Formulating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) clause as an exhaustive list of State obligations (e.g. not to (i) deny justice; (ii) treat investors in a manifestly arbitrary manner; (iii) flagrantly violate due process);
*Clarifying the distinction between legitimate regulatory activity and regulatory takings giving rise to compensation (i.e. indirect expropriations);
*Limiting the Full Protection and Security (FPS) clause to establish that "physical" security and protection will only commensurate with the country's level of development;
*Limiting the scope of the transfer-of-funds clause by providing an exhaustive list of covered payments/transfers, including exceptions triggered by serious balance-of-payment difficulties, and stipulating that the investor's transfer rights are contingent on its compliance with the host State's fiscal and other transfer-related obligations;
*Including exceptions to protect human rights, health, core labour standards and the environment, along with a check-and-balance system that ensures there is enough policy space while avoiding abuse; and
*Including clauses designed to eliminate or make investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) the last resort (e.g. after the investor's exhaustion of local remedies and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms).

== The New Generation of Investment Policies ==

The IPFSD embodies the new generation of investment policies that seeks to create a more intricate development strategy that maintains a favorable investment climate.  New generation investment policies seek to give investment policy a more prominent place in development strategies.  The continuous need to respond to newly emerging challenges and trends make it necessary to review and modify these guidelines.

== Dynamic Nature of IPFSD and The Investment Policy Hub ==

IPFSD has been designed with the intention of providing immediate technical assistance for the negotiation of investment agreements, while maintaining a dialog between investment policy stakeholders including the international development community, investors, business associations, labor unions, relevant NGOs and interest groups. The result of these ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations will be a dynamic document.

To that end, in concert with IPFSD, UNCTAD has provided a platform for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders—the [http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ Investment Policy Hub] which allows investment stakeholders to post comments regarding the content of the IPFSD. The combination then, of IPFSD and the Investment Policy Hub will enable IPFSD to remain a valuable resource for investment policy makers into the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">'''Judicial reform''' is the complete or partial political [[reform]] of a country's [[judiciary]]. Judicial reform is often done as a part of wider reform of the country's political system or a legal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. "[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the judicial reform often include; codification of law instead of [[common law]], moving from an [[inquisitorial system]] to an [[adversarial system]], establishing stronger judicial independence with [[judicial council]]s or changes to appointment procedure, establishing mandatory retirement age for judges or  enhancing independence of [[prosecution]].

'''Life-cycle engineering''' (LCE) is an approach to assess the environmental impacts in conjunction with economic impacts under consideration of technical boundary conditions. Scope of the assessment is usually the whole life cycle of a product consisting of production, use phase and end of life.
The [[environmental impact]]s are assessed using environmental [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA). The economic impacts are assessed according to the [[Whole-life cost|life cycle costing]] (LCC) approach. Technical boundary conditions are taken into account providing some limitations on the model, thus verifying the technical feasibility.

LCE aims to deliver a consistent standard of living for future generations that can be maintained indefinitely. Not only does LCE aim to reduce negative impacts on the environment but it can also be used to reduce [[Cost|economic costs]] for businesses and every day society. 

One aspect of LCE for businesses is the extension of a part of a [[Product life cycle|products life-cycle]]. The method of involving incremental innovation within production can be seen as a main way to achieve this. The combination of innovation together with technology allows for the function of products to be pushed further, allowing designers to improve the quality of how products meet expanding customer needs. 
The key themes are economic, social, environmental and technological. All these themes are interlinking and can be influenced by life cycle engineering.
 
'''Economic factors'''

•	[[Productivity]]

•	Quality of products

•	Impact on future investments

•	Profitability 

'''Social factors'''

'''''{{lang|la|Magna Carta Libertatum}}''''' ([[Medieval Latin]] for "the Great Charter of the Liberties"), commonly called '''{{lang|la|Magna Carta}}''' (also ''Magna Charta''; "Great Charter"),{{Efn|The document's Latin name is spelled either ''Magna Carta'' or ''Magna Charta'', (the pronunciation is the same) and, in English, with or without the definite article "the".  Latin does not have a definite article equivalent to "the". The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' recommends usage without the definite article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/112237?redirectedFrom=Magna+Carta|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=20 November 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spelling ''Charta'' originates in the 18th century, as a restoration of [[classical Latin]] ''[[:wikt:charta|charta]]'' for the [[Medieval Latin]] spelling ''carta''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis|Du Cange]] s.v. [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/charta#CHARTA1 1 carta]&lt;/ref&gt; While "Charta" remains an acceptable variant spelling it never became prevalent in English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195142365|page=541|url=https://books.google.com/?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA541#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} "The usual—and the better—form is ''Magna Carta''. [...] ''Magna Carta'' does not take a definite article".
''Magna Charta'' is the recommended spelling in German-language literature. ([http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Magna_Charta Duden online])&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[charter]] of [[rights]] agreed to by [[John, King of England|King John of England]] at [[Runnymede]], near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], on 15 June 1215.{{Efn|Within this article, dates before 14 September 1752 are in the Julian calendar. Later dates are in the Gregorian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, however, the date would have been 22 June 1215.}} First drafted by the [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop of Canterbury]] to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel [[baron]]s, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on [[Feudalism|feudal]] payments to [[the Crown]], to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by [[Pope Innocent III]], leading to the [[First Barons' War]]. After John's death, the regency government of his young son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause.  At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace [[Treaty of Lambeth|treaty agreed at Lambeth]], where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller [[Charter of the Forest]] which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's [[Statutory law|statute law]].

The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the [[Anglo-Saxons]], that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]] had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as ''[[habeas corpus]]''. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir [[Edward Coke]] used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the [[divine right of kings]] propounded by the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchs. Both [[James VI and I|James I]] and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the [[English Civil War]] of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.

The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and the formation of the [[United States Constitution|American Constitution]] in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.{{Efn|The United States (US) Constitution was written in 1787, went into effect in 1788, after ratification by nine of the 13 states, and the US Federal government started operation in 1789.}} Research by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. Magna Carta still forms an important symbol of liberty today, often cited by politicians and campaigners, and is held in great respect by the British and American legal communities, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] describing it as "the greatest constitutional document of all times&lt;!-- [sic]; should be "of all time", of course, but this is the quotation in the book --&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot".{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=268}}

In the 21st century, four [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the original 1215 charter remain in existence, two at the [[British Library]], one at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and one at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. There are also a handful of the subsequent charters in public and private ownership, including copies of the 1297 charter in both the United States and Australia. The original charters were written on [[parchment]] sheets using [[quill]] pens, in [[Scribal abbreviation|heavily abbreviated]] [[medieval Latin]], which was the convention for legal documents at that time. Each was sealed with the royal [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]] (made of [[beeswax]] and [[resin]] [[sealing wax]]): very few of the seals have survived. Although scholars refer to the 63 numbered "clauses" of Magna Carta, this is a modern system of numbering, introduced by Sir [[William Blackstone]] in 1759; the original charter formed a single, long unbroken text. The four original 1215 charters were displayed together at the British Library for one day, 3 February 2015, to mark the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta.

====Background====
{{Main article|John, King of England}}
[[File:King John from De Rege Johanne.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An illuminated picture of King John riding a white horse and accompanied by four hounds. The King is chasing a stag, and several rabbits can be seen at the bottom of the picture.|King [[John, King of England|John]] on a [[Deer hunting|stag hunt]]]]
Magna Carta originated as an unsuccessful attempt to achieve peace between royalist and rebel factions in 1215, as part of the events leading to the outbreak of the [[First Barons' War]]. England was ruled by King [[John, King of England|John]], the third of the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin kings]]. Although the kingdom had a robust administrative system, the nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=8}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}} John and his predecessors had ruled using the principle of ''vis et voluntas'', or "force and will", taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}} Many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, with the counsel of the leading members of the realm, but there was no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}}

John had lost most of his ancestral lands in France to King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] in 1204 and had struggled to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money to fight a war which ended in expensive failure in 1214.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=7}} Following the defeat of his allies at the [[Battle of Bouvines]], John had to sue for peace and pay compensation.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=168}} John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=139}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=181}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=6–7}} A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=9}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=174}}

The rebels took an oath that they would "stand fast for the liberty of the church and the realm", and demanded that the King confirm the [[Charter of Liberties]] that had been declared by King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in the previous century, and which was perceived by the barons to protect their rights.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=256–58}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=174}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|pp=131–32}} The rebel leadership was unimpressive by the standards of the time, even disreputable, but were united by their hatred of John;{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=130}} [[Robert FitzWalter]], later elected leader of the rebel barons, claimed publicly that John had attempted to rape his daughter,{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=104}} and was implicated in a plot to assassinate John in 1212.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=165}}

[[File:Innozenz3.jpg|thumb|A contemporaneous mural of [[Pope Innocent III]]]]
{{anchor|Unknown Charter of Liberties}}&lt;!--[[Unknown Charter of Liberties]] redirects here--&gt;John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms, and sponsored discussions in [[Oxford]] between his agents and the rebels during the spring.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=178}} Both sides appealed to [[Pope Innocent III]] for assistance in the dispute.{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=132}} During the negotiations, the rebellious barons produced an initial document, which historians have termed "the Unknown Charter of Liberties", which drew on Henry I's Charter of Liberties for much of its language; seven articles from that document later appeared in the "Articles of the Barons" and the subsequent charter.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=115}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=471–72}}{{sfn|Vincent|2012|pp=59–60}}

It was John's hope that the Pope would give him valuable legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared himself to be a papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=179}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=132}} John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=178}} In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a [[crusades|crusader]], a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=233}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=258–59}}

Letters backing John arrived from the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had organised into a military faction. They congregated at [[Northampton]] in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on [[London]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], and [[Exeter]].{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=174, 179–80}} John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}} The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, but this was not attractive to the rebels.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=112}} [[Stephen Langton]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}

====Great Charter of 1215====
[[File:Article-barons-add-ms-4838.jpg|thumb|upright|The Articles of the Barons, 1215, held by the [[British Library]]]]
John met the rebel leaders at [[Runnymede]], a [[water-meadow]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], on 10 June 1215. Runnymede was a traditional place for assemblies, but it was also located on neutral ground between the royal fortress of [[Windsor Castle]] and the rebel base at [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]], and offered both sides the security of a rendezvous where they were unlikely to find themselves at a military disadvantage.{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|2015|p=36}}{{sfn|Holt|2015|p=219}} Here the rebels presented John with their draft demands for reform, the 'Articles of the Barons'.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}} Stephen Langton's pragmatic efforts at mediation over the next ten days turned these incomplete demands into a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; a few years later, this agreement was renamed Magna Carta, meaning "Great Charter".{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=180, 182}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}} By 15 June, general agreement had been made on a text, and on 19 June, the rebels renewed their oaths of loyalty to John and copies of the charter were formally issued.{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}

Although, as the historian [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] has noted, the charter "wasted no time on political theory", it went beyond simply addressing individual baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=182}} It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and, most importantly, limitations on taxation and other feudal payments to the Crown, with certain forms of feudal taxation requiring baronial consent.{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=184–85}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=9}} It focused on the rights of free men—in particular the barons{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=182}} - however, the rights of serfs were included in articles 16, 20, and 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-english-translation
|title=Magna Carta|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Runnymede Charter of Liberties did not apply to [[Chester]], which at the time was a [[Earl of Chester|separate feudal domain]]. [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Earl Ranulf]] granted his own [[Magna Carta of Chester]].{{sfn|Hewit|1929|p=9}} Some of its articles were similar to the Runnymede Charter.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=379–80}}}} Its style and content reflected Henry I's Charter of Liberties, as well as a wider body of legal traditions, including the royal charters issued to towns, the operations of the Church and baronial courts and European charters such as the Statute of Pamiers.{{sfn|Vincent|2012|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|pp=293–94}}

Under what historians later labelled "clause 61", or the "security clause", a council of 25 barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}} If John did not conform to the charter within 40 days of being notified of a transgression by the council, the 25 barons were empowered by clause 61 to seize John's castles and lands until, in their judgement, amends had been made.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261–62}} Men were to be compelled to swear an oath to assist the council in controlling the King, but once redress had been made for any breaches, the King would continue to rule as before. In one sense this was not unprecedented; other kings had previously conceded the right of individual resistance to their subjects if the King did not uphold his obligations. Magna Carta was however novel in that it set up a formally recognised means of collectively coercing the King.{{sfn|Goodman|1995|pp=260–61}} The historian [[W. L. Warren|Wilfred Warren]] argues that it was almost inevitable that the clause would result in civil war, as it "was crude in its methods and disturbing in its implications".{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=239–40}} The barons were trying to force John to keep to the charter, but clause 61 was so heavily weighted against the King that this version of the charter could not survive.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261–62}}

John and the rebel barons did not trust each other, and neither side seriously attempted to implement the peace accord.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|p=479}} The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised.{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=189–91}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=262}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=239, 242}} Disputes began to emerge between the royalist faction and those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated .{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}

Clause 61 of Magna Carta contained a commitment from John that he would "seek to obtain nothing from anyone, in our own person or through someone else, whereby any of these grants or liberties may be revoked or diminished".{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=13}}&lt;ref name="All clauses"/&gt; Despite this, the King appealed to Pope Innocent for help in July, arguing that the charter compromised the Pope's rights as John's feudal lord.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190–91}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}} As part of the June peace deal, the barons were supposed to surrender London by 15 August, but this they refused to do.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190}} Meanwhile, instructions from the Pope arrived in August, written before the peace accord, with the result that papal commissioners excommunicated the rebel barons and suspended Langton from office in early September.{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=244–45}} Once aware of the charter, the Pope responded in detail: in a letter dated 24 August and arriving in late September, he declared the charter to be "not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust" since John had been "forced to accept" it, and accordingly the charter was "null, and void of all validity for ever"; under threat of excommunication, the King was not to observe the charter, nor the barons try to enforce it.{{sfn|Rothwell|1975|pp=324–26}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=245–46}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190}}

By then, violence had broken out between the two sides; less than three months after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=1}}{{sfn|Crouch|1996|p=114}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}} The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], for help, offering him the English throne.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|pp=264–67}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}{{efn|Louis' claim to the English throne, described as "debatable" by the historian David Carpenter, derived from his wife, [[Blanche of Castile]], who was the granddaughter of King [[Henry II of England]]. Louis argued that since John had been legitimately deposed, the barons could then legally appoint him king over the claims of John's son Henry.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}}} The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October 1216, leaving the nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as his heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|1990|pp=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Charter of 1216====
Although the Charter of 1215 was a failure as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new government of the young Henry III as a way of drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], one of the most famous knights in England.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=14–15}} William knighted the boy, and Cardinal [[Guala Bicchieri]], the [[papal legate]] to England, then oversaw his coronation at [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 28 October.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=189}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

The young King inherited a difficult situation, with over half of England occupied by the rebels.{{sfn|Weiler|2012|p=1}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=1}} He had substantial support though from Guala, who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=259–60}} Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, during which Henry gave [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=260}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}} [[Pope Honorius III]] declared that Henry was the Pope's [[vassal]] and [[Ward (law)|ward]], and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}} As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and thereby entitled to special protection from Rome.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}

The war was not going well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=301}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}} John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country.{{sfn|Aurell|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}} Henry's government encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=21–22, 24–25}}{{sfn|Powicke|1963|p=5}} The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=25}}

====Great Charter of 1217====
{{see also|First Barons' War|Charter of the Forest|English land law}}
[[File:Forest-charter-1225-C13550-78.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of the Forest, 1217, held by the British Library]]
In February 1217, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=27}} In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was the equivalent of a religious crusade.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=28–29}} This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=127–28}} Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Battle of Lincoln]] in May.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=36–40}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=216}}

Meanwhile, support for Louis' campaign was diminishing in France, and he concluded that the war in England was lost.{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=173}} He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of [[excommunication]] would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=41–42}} The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=42}}

In the absence of a settlement, Louis remained in London with his remaining forces, hoping for the arrival of reinforcements from France.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=42}} When the expected fleet did arrive in August, it was intercepted and defeated by loyalists at the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=44}} Louis entered into fresh peace negotiations, and the factions came to agreement on the final [[Treaty of Lambeth]], also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on 12 and 13 September 1217.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=44}} The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit; it included a promise, however, that Louis' followers would be allowed to enjoy their traditional liberties and customs, referring back to the Charter of 1216.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=41, 44–45}} Louis left England as agreed and joined the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the south of France, bringing the war to an end.{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=173}}

A [[Magnum Concilium|great council]] was called in October and November to take stock of the post-war situation; this council is thought to have formulated and issued the Charter of 1217.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=60}} The charter resembled that of 1216, although some additional clauses were added to protect the rights of the barons over their feudal subjects, and the restrictions on the Crown's ability to levy taxation were watered down.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=60–61}} There remained a range of disagreements about the management of the royal forests, which involved a special legal system that had resulted in a source of considerable royal revenue; complaints existed over both the implementation of these courts, and the geographic boundaries of the royal forests.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=61–62}} A complementary charter, the [[Charter of the Forest]], was created, pardoning existing forest offences, imposing new controls over the forest courts, and establishing a review of the forest boundaries.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=61–62}} To distinguish the two charters, the term ''magna carta libertatum'', "the great charter of liberties", was used by the scribes to refer to the larger document, which in time became known simply as Magna Carta.{{sfn|White|1915|pp=472–75}}{{sfn|White|1917|pp=545–55}}

====Great Charter of 1225====
[[File:Magna Carta (1225 version with seal).jpg|thumb|upright|The 1225 version of Magna Carta issued by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], held in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]]]
Magna Carta became increasingly embedded into English political life during Henry III's [[Minor (law)|minority]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=402}} As the King grew older, his government slowly began to recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=333–35, 382–83}} Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the charters became clear in the [[Court (royal)|royal court]], when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued—if sometimes incorrectly—that the charters protected the new arrangements.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=295–96}}{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=6}} This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and [[William Brewer (justice)|William Brewer]] over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters, given that he had been forced to agree to them.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=296–97}} On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters, enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=297}}

Two years later, the question of Henry's commitment to the charters re-emerged, when Louis VIII of France invaded Henry's remaining provinces in France, [[Poitou]] and [[Gascony]].{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=176}}{{sfn|Weiler|2012|p=20}} Henry's army in Poitou was under-resourced, and the province quickly fell.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=371–73}} It became clear that Gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from England.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=374–75}} In early 1225, a great council approved a tax of £40,000 to dispatch an army, which quickly retook Gascony.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=376, 378}}{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=176–77}} In exchange for agreeing to support Henry, the barons demanded that the King reissue Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=379}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=307}} The content was almost identical to the 1217 versions, but in the new versions, the King declared that the charters were issued of his own "spontaneous and free will" and confirmed them with the royal seal, giving the new Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than the previous versions.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=383}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=307}}

The barons anticipated that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by the advice of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=2–3, 383, 386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal.{{sfn|Clanchy|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=71}} This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid.{{sfn|Clanchy|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=71}} In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=174}}

Henry placed a symbolic emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=76, 99}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}} He generally acted within the terms of the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=76, 99}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}} The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=3}} The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of his rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

Despite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=26, 29, 37, 43}} The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=105}} Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=105}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

In 1258, a group of barons seized power from Henry in a ''[[coup d'état]]'', citing the need to strictly enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the [[Provisions of Oxford]].{{sfn|Davis|2013|pp=195–97}} The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to [[Louis IX of France]] in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=104}}

Louis came down firmly in favour of Henry, but the French arbitration failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons refused to accept the verdict. England slipped back into the [[Second Barons' War]], which was won by Henry's son, [[Edward I of England|the Lord Edward]]. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=224}} In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the [[Statute of Marlborough]], which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=163}}

King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] reissued the Charters of 1225 in 1297 in return for a new tax.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=427}} It is this version which remains in [[statute]] today, although with most articles now repealed.&lt;ref name=natarch&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta (1297)|publisher=The National Archive|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/contents|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/contents|title=Magna Carta (1297)|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{anchor|Confirmatio}}

The ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' (Confirmation of Charters) was issued in [[Norman language|Norman French]] by Edward I in 1297.{{sfn|Edwards|1943}} Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, and they had armed themselves against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/cartarum.html|title=Confirmatio Cartarum|accessdate=30 November 2007|publisher=britannia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobles had sought to add another document, the ''De Tallagio'', to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was not prepared to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the ''Confirmatio'', confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent,{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=427}} although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=434}}

A passage mandates that copies shall be distributed in "cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the people two times by the year",{{sfn|Cobbett|Howell|Howell|Jardine|1810|p=980}} hence the permanent installation of a copy in [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/magna-carta|publisher=Salisbury Cathedral|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Confirmation's second article, it is confirmed that

With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an additional document was granted, the ''Articuli super Cartas'' (The Articles upon the Charters).{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=62}} It was composed of 17 articles and sought in part to deal with the problem of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the [[sheriff]] of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.{{sfn|Fritze|Robison|2002|pp=34–35}}

[[Pope Clement V]] continued the papal policy of supporting monarchs (who ruled by divine grace) against any claims in Magna Carta which challenged the King's rights, and annulled the ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' in 1305. Edward I interpreted Clement V's [[papal bull]] annulling the ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' as effectively applying to the ''Articuli super Cartas'', although the latter was not specifically mentioned.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|pp=547–48}} In 1306 Edward I took the opportunity given by the Pope's backing to reassert forest law over large areas which had been "disafforested". Both Edward and the Pope were accused by some contemporary chroniclers of "perjury", and it was suggested by Robert McNair Scott that [[Robert the Bruce]] refused to make peace with Edward I's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], in 1312 with the justification: "How shall the king of England keep faith with me, since he does not observe the sworn promises made to his liege men..."{{sfn|Menache|2003|pp=253–55}}{{sfn|Scott|2014}}

====Magna Carta's influence on English medieval law====
The Great Charter was referred to in legal cases throughout the medieval period. For example, in 1226, the knights of [[Lincolnshire]] argued that their local sheriff was changing customary practice regarding the local courts, "contrary to their liberty which they ought to have by the charter of the lord king".{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=44–45}} In practice, cases were not brought against the King for breach of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, but it was possible to bring a case against the King's officers, such as his sheriffs, using the argument that the King's officers were acting contrary to liberties granted by the King in the charters.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=45–46}}

In addition, medieval cases referred to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation.{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=56}} Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=56–57}}

===14th–15th centuries===
[[File:Magna charta cum statutis angliae p1.jpg|upright|thumb|''Magna carta cum statutis angliae'' (Great Charter with English Statutes), early 14th-century]]
During the reign of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] six measures, later known as the ''Six Statutes'', were passed between 1331 and 1369. They sought to clarify certain parts of the Charters. In particular the third statute, in 1354, redefined clause 29, with "free man" becoming "no man, of whatever [[Estates of the realm|estate]] or condition he may be", and introduced the phrase "[[Due process|due process of law]]" for "lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land".{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=123}}

Between the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was reconfirmed 32 times according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], and possibly as many as 45 times.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Turner|2003a}} Often the first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, as in the previous century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch.{{sfn|Turner|2003a}} The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=800th anniversary of Magna Carta|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media/1910459/gs%201945b%20-%20background%20note%20from%20mpa.pdf|publisher=Church of England General Synod|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.britroyals.com/magnacarta.htm|publisher=Royal Family History|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ben|title=The Origins of the Magna Carta|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Origins-of-the-Magna-Carta/|publisher=Historic UK|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta ceased to occupy a central role in English political life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=132}} The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=133}}

===16th century===
[[File:Magna Carta confirmed by Henry III.jpg|thumb|A version of the Charter of 1217, produced between 1437 and c. 1450]]
During the 16th century, the interpretation of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=185–87}} [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] took power at the end of the turbulent [[Wars of the Roses]], followed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=185–86}}

Tudor historians rediscovered the [[Barnwell chronicler]], who was more favourable to King John than other 13th-century texts, and, as historian Ralph Turner describes, they "viewed King John in a positive light as a hero struggling against the papacy", showing "little sympathy for the Great Charter or the rebel barons".{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=138}} Pro-Catholic demonstrations during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|1536 uprising]] cited Magna Carta, accusing the King of not giving it sufficient respect.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}}

The first mechanically printed edition of Magna Carta was probably the ''Magna Carta cum aliis Antiquis Statutis'' of 1508 by [[Richard Pynson]], although the early printed versions of the 16th century incorrectly attributed the origins of Magna Carta to Henry III and 1225, rather than to John and 1215, and accordingly worked from the later text.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|p=146}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=324}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=187}} An abridged English-language edition was published by [[John Rastell]] in 1527.
[[Thomas Berthelet]], Pynson's successor as the royal printer during 1530–1547,
printed an edition of the text along with other "ancient statutes" in 1531 and 1540.&lt;ref&gt;

revised edition by Thomas Marshe (1556), ''Magna Carta et cetera antiqua statuta nunc nouiter per diuersa exemplaria examinata et summa diligentia castigata et correcta cui adiecta est noua tabula valde necessaria.'' .&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1534, [[George Ferrers]] published the first unabridged English-language edition of Magna Carta, dividing the Charter into 37 numbered clauses.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=147–49}}

At the end of the 16th century, there was an upsurge in antiquarian interest in England.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}} This work concluded that there was a set of ancient English customs and laws, temporarily overthrown by the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]], which had then been recovered in 1215 and recorded in Magna Carta, which in turn gave authority to important 16th century legal principles.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=140}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}} Modern historians note that although this narrative was fundamentally incorrect—many refer to it as a "[[Political myth|myth]]"—it took on great importance among the legal historians of the time.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}{{efn|Among the historians to have discussed the "myth" of Magna Carta and the ancient English constitution are Claire Breay, Geoffrey Hindley, [[J. C. Holt|James Holt]], [[J. G. A. Pocock|John Pocock]], Danny Danziger, and John Gillingham.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=183}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=124}}{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=9}}}}

The antiquarian [[William Lambarde]], for example, published what he believed were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing the origins of the 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, albeit misinterpreting the dates of many documents concerned.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=140}} [[Francis Bacon]] argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes.{{sfn|Eele|2013|p=20}} Antiquarians [[Robert Beale (diplomat)|Robert Beale]], [[James Morice]], and [[Richard Cosin]] argued that Magna Carta was a statement of liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=216–30}} Those who questioned these conclusions, including the Member of Parliament [[Arthur Hall (English politician)|Arthur Hall]], faced sanctions.{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=154}}{{sfn|Wright|1919|p=72}}

===17th–18th centuries===

====Political tensions====
[[File:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jurist]] [[Edward Coke]] made extensive political use of Magna Carta.]]
In the early 17th century, Magna Carta became increasingly important as a political document in arguments over the authority of the English monarchy.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}} [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]], and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their opponents to challenge the monarchy.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}

Magna Carta, it was argued, recognised and protected the liberty of individual Englishmen, made the King subject to the common law of the land, formed the origin of the trial by jury system, and acknowledged the ancient origins of Parliament: because of Magna Carta and this [[ancient constitution]], an English monarch was unable to alter these long-standing English customs.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}}{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=300}}{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=148}} Although the arguments based on Magna Carta were historically inaccurate, they nonetheless carried symbolic power, as the charter had immense significance during this period; antiquarians such as Sir [[Henry Spelman]] described it as "the most majestic and a sacrosanct anchor to English Liberties".{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}

Sir Edward Coke was a leader in using Magna Carta as a political tool during this period. Still working from the 1225 version of the text—the first printed copy of the 1215 charter only emerged in 1610—Coke spoke and wrote about Magna Carta repeatedly.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}} His work was challenged at the time by [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], and modern historians such as Ralph Turner and Claire Breay have critiqued Coke as "misconstruing" the original charter "anachronistically and uncritically", and taking a "very selective" approach to his analysis.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=148}} More sympathetically, [[J. C. Holt]] noted that the history of the charters had already become "distorted" by the time Coke was carrying out his work.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=20–21}}

[[File:John Lilburne.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Lilburne]] criticised Magna Carta as an inadequate definition of English liberties.]]
In 1621, a bill was presented to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer [[John Selden]] argued during [[Darnell's Case]] in 1627 that the right of ''habeas corpus'' was backed by Magna Carta.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=156}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=189}} Coke supported the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=189–90}}{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=157}} The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=189}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=280–81}} Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta in any way that would reduce his independence as King.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=41}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=190}}

England descended into [[English Civil War|civil war]] in the 1640s, resulting in Charles I's execution in 1649. Under the [[Commonwealth of England|republic]] that followed, some questioned whether Magna Carta, an agreement with a monarch, was still relevant.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=271}} An anti-[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] pamphlet published in 1660, ''The English devil'', said that the nation had been "compelled to submit to this Tyrant Nol or be  cut off by him; nothing but a word and a blow, his Will was his Law; tell him of Magna Carta, he would lay his hand on his sword and cry Magna Farta".{{sfn|Woolwrych|2003|p=95}} In a 2005 speech the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], repeated the claim that Cromwell had referred to Magna Carta as "Magna Farta".&lt;ref name=woolfspeech/&gt;

The radical groups that flourished during this period held differing opinions of Magna Carta. The [[Levellers]] rejected history and law as presented by their contemporaries, holding instead to an "anti-Normanism" viewpoint.{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=127}} [[John Lilburne]], for example, argued that Magna Carta contained only some of the freedoms that had supposedly existed under the Anglo-Saxons before being crushed by the [[Norman yoke]].{{sfn|Kewes|2006|p=279}} The Leveller [[Richard Overton (Leveller)|Richard Overton]] described the charter as "a beggarly thing containing many marks of intolerable bondage".{{sfn|Kewes|2006|p=226}} Both saw Magna Carta as a useful declaration of liberties that could be used against governments they disagreed with.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=281–82}} [[Gerrard Winstanley]], the leader of the more extreme [[Diggers]], stated "the best lawes that England hath, [viz., the Magna Carta] were got by our Forefathers importunate petitioning unto the kings that still were their Task-masters; and yet these best laws are yoaks and manicles, tying one sort of people to be slaves to another; Clergy and Gentry have got their freedom, but the common people still are, and have been left servants to work for them."{{sfn|Hill|2006|pp=111–22}}{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|p=85}}

====Glorious Revolution====
[[File:Magna Carta - John Pine engraving 1733.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1733 engraving of the Charter of 1215 by [[John Pine]]]]
The first attempt at a proper [[historiography]] was undertaken by [[Robert Brady (writer)|Robert Brady]],{{sfn|Pocock|1987|pp=182–228}} who refuted the supposed antiquity of Parliament and belief in the immutable continuity of the law. Brady realised that the liberties of the Charter were limited and argued that the liberties were the grant of the King. By putting Magna Carta in historical context, he cast doubt on its contemporary political relevance;{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=165}} his historical understanding did not survive the [[Glorious Revolution]], which, according to the historian [[J. G. A. Pocock]], "marked a setback for the course of English historiography."{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=228}}

According to the [[Whig interpretation of history]], the Glorious Revolution was an example of the reclaiming of ancient liberties. Reinforced with [[John Locke|Lockean]] concepts, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] believed England's constitution to be a [[social contract]], based on documents such as Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]].{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=169–70}}  The ''English Liberties'' (1680, in later versions often ''British Liberties'') by the Whig propagandist [[Henry Care]] (d. 1688) was a cheap polemical book that was influential and much-reprinted, in the American colonies as well as Britain, and made Magna Carta central to the history and the contemporary legitimacy of its subject.{{sfn|Breay|Harrison|2015|pp=110–11, 134}}

Ideas about the nature of law in general were beginning to change. In 1716, the [[Septennial Act 1716|Septennial Act]] was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Act]] (1694) (enacted less than a quarter of a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|pp=113–14}}

It also greatly extended the powers of Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] was replaced by [[Parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary supremacy]]. It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would be challenged by the likes of [[Granville Sharp]]. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited [[slavery]].{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|pp=113–14}}

Sir [[William Blackstone]] published a critical edition of the 1215 Charter in 1759, and gave it the numbering system still used today.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=67–68}} In 1763, Member of Parliament [[John Wilkes]] was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, ''No. 45, 23 April 1763''; he cited Magna Carta continually.{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=207}} [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden#John Wilkes MP|Lord Camden]] denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodrich|first1=Chauncey A.|title=The Speeches of Lord Chatham|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat09.htm|publisher=Classic Persuasion}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine]], in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'', would disregard Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights on the grounds that they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Irvine of Lairg 'The Spirit of Magna Carta Continues to Resonate in Modern Law'|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/lairg|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=7 November 2014|date=December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070809/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/lairg|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in the Thirteen Colonies and the United States====
[[File:Magna Carta replica and display in the rotunda of the United States Capitol, Washington, DC - 20070517.jpg|thumb|Magna Carta replica and display in the rotunda of the [[United States Capitol]], Washington, D.C.]]
When English colonists left for the New World, they brought royal charters that established the colonies. The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay Company]] charter, for example, stated that the colonists would "have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brink|first1=Robert J.|title=History on display: one lawyer's musings on Magna Carta|journal=Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly|date=18 August 2014|url=http://masslawyersweekly.com/reprints/history-on-display-one-lawyers-musings-on-the-magna-carta/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Virginia Company|Virginia Charter]] of 1606, which was largely drafted by Sir Edward Coke, stated that the colonists would have the same "liberties, franchises and immunities" as people born in England.{{sfn|Howard|2008|p=28}} The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] contained similarities to clause 29 of Magna Carta; when drafting it, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] viewed Magna Carta as the chief embodiment of English common law.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|p=194}} The other colonies would follow their example. In 1638, [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] sought to recognise Magna Carta as part of the law of the province, but the request was denied by Charles I.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|p=195}}

In 1687, [[William Penn]] published ''The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: being the birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England'', which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed on American soil. Penn's comments reflected Coke's, indicating a belief that Magna Carta was a [[Fundamental Laws of England|fundamental law]].{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=210}} The colonists drew on English law books, leading them to an anachronistic interpretation of Magna Carta, believing that it guaranteed trial by jury and ''habeas corpus''.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=211}}

The development of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which retained an adherence to [[English common law]], but it directly affected the relationship between Britain and the colonies.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|pp=183–84}} When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting not so much for new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.&lt;ref name="NARA-legacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta and Its American Legacy|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/legacy.html|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the [[United States Constitution]] became the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law of the land]], recalling the manner in which Magna Carta had come to be regarded as fundamental law.&lt;ref name="NARA-legacy"/&gt; The Constitution's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] guarantees that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law", a phrase that was derived from Magna Carta.&lt;ref name="NARA-Magna Carta"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magna Carta|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Constitution included a similar writ in the [[Denied powers|Suspension Clause]], Article 1, Section 9: "The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habeas Corpus|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/habeas+corpus|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these proclaim that no person may be imprisoned or detained without evidence that he or she committed a crime. The [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] states that "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." The writers of the U.S. Constitution wished to ensure that the rights they already held, such as those that they believed were provided by Magna Carta, would be preserved unless explicitly curtailed.{{sfn|Stimson|2004|p=124}}{{sfn|Black|1999|p=10}}

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has explicitly referenced [[Edward Coke|Lord Coke]]'s analysis of Magna Carta as an antecedent of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment's]] right to a speedy trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=386&amp;invol=213 |title='Klopfer v.

===19th–21st centuries===

====Interpretation====
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 226 - John Signs the Great Charter.jpg|thumb|A romanticised 19th-century recreation of King John signing Magna Carta]]
Initially, the Whig interpretation of Magna Carta and its role in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian [[William Stubbs]]'s ''Constitutional History of England'', published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=199–200}} Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=1}}

This view of Magna Carta began to recede. The late-Victorian jurist and historian [[Frederic William Maitland]] provided an alternative academic history in 1899, which began to return Magna Carta to its historical roots.{{sfn|Simmons|1998|pp=69–83}} In 1904, [[Edward Jenks]] published an article entitled "The Myth of Magna Carta", which undermined the previously accepted view of Magna Carta.{{sfn|Galef|1998|pp=78–79}} Historians such as [[Albert Pollard]] agreed with Jenks in concluding that Edward Coke had largely "invented" the myth of Magna Carta in the 17th century; these historians argued that the 1215 charter had not referred to liberty for the people at large, but rather to the protection of baronial rights.{{sfn|Pollard|1912|pp=31–32}}

This view also became popular in wider circles, and in 1930 [[Sellar and Yeatman]] published their parody on English history, ''[[1066 and All That]]'', in which they  mocked the supposed importance of Magna Carta and its promises of universal liberty: "Magna Charter was therefore the chief cause of Democracy in England, and thus a ''Good Thing'' for everyone (except the Common People)".{{sfn|Barnes|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=283}}

In many literary representations of the medieval past, however, Magna Carta remained a foundation of English national identity. Some authors used the medieval roots of the document as an argument to preserve the social status quo, while others pointed to Magna Carta to challenge perceived economic injustices.{{sfn|Simmons|1998|pp=69–83}} The [[Baronial Order of Magna Charta]] was formed in 1898 to promote the ancient principles and values felt to be displayed in Magna Carta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnacharta.com/|title=Home|publisher=The Baronial Order of Magna Charta|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal profession in England and the United States continued to hold Magna Carta in high esteem; they were instrumental in forming the Magna Carta Society in 1922 to protect the meadows at Runnymede from development in the 1920s, and in 1957, the [[American Bar Association]] erected the [[Magna Carta Memorial]] at Runnymede.&lt;ref name="NARA-Magna Carta"/&gt;{{sfn|Wright|1990|p=167}}{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=2–3}} The prominent lawyer [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] described Magna Carta in 1956 as "the greatest constitutional document of all times&lt;!-- [sic]; see note above --&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot".{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}

====Repeal of articles and constitutional influence====
Radicals such as Sir [[Francis Burdett]] believed that Magna Carta could not be repealed,{{sfn|Burdett|1810|p=41}} but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] (9 [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Geo. 4]] c. 31 s. 1)&lt;!-- ie section 1 of the 31st statute issued in the 9th year of George IV --&gt;&lt;!-- "nor will We not" in clause 29 is correctly quoted from this source --&gt;,&lt;ref name=UKStatute/&gt; was the first time a clause of Magna Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.sagamoreinstitute.org/library-article/magna-carta/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105004655/http://www.sagamoreinstitute.org/library-article/magna-carta/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 November 2014|publisher=Segamore Institute|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1863]], and in modern [[Northern Ireland]] and also in the modern [[Republic of Ireland]] by the [[Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872]].&lt;ref name=UKStatute/&gt;

Many later attempts to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta. The British dominions, Australia and New Zealand,{{sfn|Clark|2000}} Canada{{sfn|Kennedy|1922|p=228}} (except [[Quebec]]), and formerly the [[Union of South Africa]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], reflected the influence of Magna Carta in their laws, and the Charter's effects can be seen in the laws of other states that evolved from the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Drew|2004|pp=pxvi–pxxiii}}

====Modern legacy====
[[File:ABA-wyrdlight-815935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Magna Carta Memorial]] at Runnymede, designed by Sir [[Edward Maufe]] and erected by the [[American Bar Association]] in 1957. The memorial stands in the meadow known historically as Long Mede: it is likely that the actual site of the sealing of Magna Carta lay further east, towards [[Egham]] and [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]].{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|2015|p=36}}]]

Magna Carta continues to have a powerful iconic status in British society, being cited by politicians and lawyers in support of constitutional positions.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} Its perceived guarantee of trial by jury and other civil liberties, for example, led to [[Tony Benn]]'s reference to the debate in 2008 over whether to increase the maximum time terrorism suspects could be [[Remand (detention)|held without charge]] from 28 to 42 days as "the day Magna Carta was repealed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/so-will-the-revolution-start-in-haltemprice-and-howden-846938.html|title=So will the revolution start in Haltemprice and Howden?|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rarely invoked in court in the modern era, in 2012 the [[Occupy London]] protestors attempted to use Magna Carta in resisting their eviction from [[St. Paul's Churchyard]] by the [[City of London]]. In his judgment the [[Master of the Rolls]] gave this short shrift, noting somewhat drily that although clause 29 was considered by many the foundation of the rule of law in England, he did not consider it directly relevant to the case, and the two other surviving clauses actually concerned the rights of the Church and the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=David Allen|url=http://blogs.ft.com/david-allen-green/2014/06/16/the-myth-of-magna-carta/|title=The myth of Magna Carta|registration=yes|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=21 January 2015|authorlink=David Allen Green|work=Financial Times|quote=The sarcasm of the Master of the Rolls was plain|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/160.html|title=The Mayor Commonalty and Citizens of London v Samede|date=22 February 2012|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Carta carries little legal weight in modern Britain, as most of its clauses have been repealed and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that the survival of the 1215 charter in national life is a "reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration" and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=2}} The historian W. L. Warren has observed that "many who knew little and cared less about the content of the Charter have, in nearly all ages, invoked its name, and with good cause, for it meant more than it said".{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=240}}

It also remains a topic of great interest to historians; [[Natalie Fryde]] characterised the charter as "one of the holiest of cows in English medieval history", with the debates over its interpretation and meaning unlikely to end.{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=1}} In many ways still a "sacred text", Magna Carta is generally considered part of the [[uncodified constitution]] [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|of the United Kingdom]]; in a 2005 speech, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], described it as the "first of a series of instruments that now are recognised as having a special constitutional status".{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=21}}&lt;ref name=woolfspeech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magnacarta800th.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Precedent_Recent_Constitutional_Change.pdf|title=Magna Carta: a precedent for recent constitutional change|work=Judiciary of England and Wales Speeches|date=15 June 2005|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Carta was reprinted in [[New Zealand]] in 1881 as one of the Imperial Acts in force there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/imp_act_1881/mc25ei84/ |title= Magna Carta (25 Ed I) |publisher= New Zealand Law online |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clause 29 of the document remains in force as part of New Zealand law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/imperial/1297/0029/latest/whole.html#DLM10926|title=Magna Carta 1297 No 29 (as at 03 September 2007), Imperial Act – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document also continues to be honoured in the United States as an antecedent of the [[United States Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name=ChartersOfFreedom&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_q_and_a.html|title=United States Constitution Q + A|work=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the UK lent one of four surviving originals of the 1215 Magna Carta to the United States for their bicentennial celebrations and also donated an ornate display case for it. The original was returned after one year, but a replica and the case are still on display in the [[United States Capitol]] Crypt in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta Replica and Display|url=http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/other/magna-carta-replica-and-display|publisher=[[Architect of the Capitol]]|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Physical format===
Numerous copies, known as [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]], were made of the various charters, and many of them still survive.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=37}} The documents were written in heavily abbreviated medieval Latin in clear handwriting, using [[quill]] pens on sheets of [[parchment]] made from sheep skin, approximately {{convert|15|by|20|in}} across.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=143}} They were sealed with the royal great seal by an official called the spigurnel, equipped with a special seal press, using beeswax and resin.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=143}} There were no signatures on the charter of 1215, and the barons present did not attach their own [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] to it.{{sfn|Browning|1898|p=50}} The charters were not numbered or divided into paragraphs or separate clauses at the time; the numbering system used today was introduced by the jurist Sir [[William Blackstone]] in 1759.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=67–68}}

===Exemplifications===

====1215 exemplifications====
[[File:Magna-carta-1225-C6257-03.jpg|thumb|upright|1225 charter, held in the British Library, with the [[Great Seal of the Realm|royal great seal]] attached]]
At least thirteen original copies of the charter of 1215 were issued by the royal chancery during that year, seven in the first tranche distributed on 24 June and another six later; they were sent to county sheriffs and bishops, who were probably charged for the privilege.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=34–35}} Slight variations exist between the surviving copies, and there was probably no single "master copy".{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=34}} Of these documents, only four survive, all held in England: two now at the [[British Library]], one at [[Lincoln Cathedral]], and one at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=35}} Each of these versions is slightly different in size and text, and each is considered by historians to be equally authoritative.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=34–36}}

The two 1215 charters held by the British Library, known as ''Cotton MS. Augustus II.106'' and ''Cotton Charter XIII.31a'', were acquired by the antiquarian [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]] in the 17th century.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=35–36}} One of these had been found by Humphrey Wyems, a London lawyer, who may have discovered it in a tailor's shop.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=36}} The other was found in [[Dover Castle]] in 1630 by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]]. The Dering charter is usually identified as the copy originally sent to the [[Cinque Ports]] in 1215.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=65}} (In 2015 it was announced that [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] had found the Dering copy to be identical to a transcription made in the 1290s from [[Canterbury Cathedral]]'s copy of 1215, and so he suggests that the Dering copy's destination was the Cathedral rather than the Cinque Ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/news/newsRelease.asp?newsPk=2372|title=Canterbury's Magna Carta rediscovered in time for 800th anniversary|publisher=Canterbury Christ Church University|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123005702/http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/news/newsRelease.asp?newsPk=2372|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/remarkable_discovery_says_copy_of_magna_carta_in_british_library_was_canterbury_charter_1_3923530|title=Remarkable discovery says copy of Magna Carta in British Library was 'Canterbury charter'|publisher=kentnews|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010037/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/remarkable_discovery_says_copy_of_magna_carta_in_british_library_was_canterbury_charter_1_3923530|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) This copy was damaged in the [[Cotton library#The Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] of 1731, when its seal was badly melted. The parchment was somewhat shrivelled but otherwise relatively unscathed, and an engraved [[facsimile]] of the charter was made by [[John Pine]] in 1733.

===Clauses===
[[File:John penny.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the "heads" side of a silver King John penny|upright|A [[silver]] King John [[penny]]; much of Magna Carta concerned how royal revenues were raised]]
Most of the 1215 charter and later versions sought to govern the feudal rights of the Crown over the barons.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, the rights of the King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. [[Feudal relief]] was one way that a king could demand money, and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} [[Scutage]] was a form of medieval taxation; all knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King, but many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead; the Crown  often used the cash to pay for mercenaries.{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=16–17}} The rate of scutage that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial; clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}}

The English judicial system had altered considerably over the previous century, with the royal judges playing a larger role in delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, and the role of the Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=29}} Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=29}} In the United States, for example, the [[Supreme Court of California]] interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Justice Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/12C3d323.htm 12 Cal. 3d 323] (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John of England (John Lackland).jpg|thumb|upright|left|King John holding a church, painted c. 1250–59 by [[Matthew Paris]]]]
[[Royal forest]]s were economically important in medieval England and were both protected and exploited by the Crown, supplying the King with hunting grounds, raw materials, and money.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=29–30}} They were subject to special royal jurisdiction and the resulting forest law was, according to the historian Richard Huscroft, "harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will".{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=97}} The size of the forests had expanded under the Angevin kings, an unpopular development.{{sfn|Poole|1993|p=29}}

The 1215 charter had several clauses relating to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably did not address the forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation of the forest courts.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}} Neither Magna Carta nor the subsequent Charter of the Forest proved entirely satisfactory as a way of managing the political tensions arising in the operation of the royal forests.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}}

Some of the clauses addressed wider economic issues. The concerns of the barons over the treatment of their debts to Jewish moneylenders, who occupied a special position in medieval England and were by tradition under the King's protection, were addressed by clauses 10 and 11.{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=353, 474}} The charter concluded this section with the phrase "debts owing to other than Jews shall be dealt with likewise", so it is debatable to what extent the Jews were being singled out by these clauses.{{sfn|Hillaby|2013|p=23}} Some issues were relatively specific, such as clause 33 which ordered the removal of all [[fishing weir]]s—an important and growing source of revenue at the time—from England's rivers.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}}

The role of the English Church had been a matter for great debate in the years prior to the 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=190}} After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=189}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=121}}

[[Investiture Controversy|These changes]] brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=189}} As described above, John had come to a compromise with Pope Innocent III in exchange for his political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}}

====Clauses remaining in English law====
Only three clauses of Magna Carta still remain on statute in England and Wales.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} These clauses concern 1) the freedom of the English Church, 2) the "ancient liberties" of the City of London (clause 13 in the 1215 charter, clause 9 in the 1297 statute), and 3) a right to due legal process (clauses 39 and 40 in the 1215 charter, clause 29 in the 1297 statute).{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} In detail, these clauses (using the numbering system from the 1297 statute) state that:

{{quotation|
* I. FIRST, We have granted to God, and by this our present Charter have confirmed, for Us and our Heirs for ever, that the Church of England shall be free, and shall have all her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable. We have granted also, and given to all the Freemen of our Realm, for Us and our Heirs for ever, these Liberties under-written, to have and to hold to them and their Heirs, of Us and our Heirs for ever.
* IX. THE [[City of London]] shall have all the old Liberties and Customs which it hath been used to have. Moreover We will and grant, that all other Cities, Boroughs, Towns, and the Barons of the [[Cinque Ports|Five Ports]], as with all other Ports, shall have all their Liberties and free Customs.
* XXIX. NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the [[Law of the land]]. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.&lt;ref name=UKStatute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 |title=(Magna Carta) (1297) (c. 9) |work=UK Statute Law Database |accessdate=2 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905014018/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 |archivedate=5 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''''Mens rea''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|z|_|ˈ|r|iː|ə}}; [[Law Latin]] for "'''guilty mind'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Elizabeth A.  Martin |title=Oxford Dictionary of Law |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-860756-3 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 889 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 289 (2d ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the mental element of a person's intention to commit a crime; or knowledge that one's action or lack of action would cause a crime to be committed. It is a [[Necessity and sufficiency#Necessity|necessary]] [[Element (criminal law)|element]] of many [[crime]]s.

The standard [[common law]] test of criminal [[legal liability|liability]] is expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea'', i.e. "the act is not [[Culpability|culpable]] unless the mind is guilty". In [[jurisdiction]]s with [[due process]], there must be both ''[[actus reus]]'' ("guilty act") and ''mens rea'' for a defendant to be guilty of a crime (see [[concurrence]]). As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in [[criminal law]]. Exceptions are known as [[strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]] crimes.

In [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for [[breach of contract]] or [[tort]], for example. But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the [[proximate cause|scope of liability]] and the [[damages]] payable to the [[plaintiff]].

In some jurisdictions, the terms ''mens rea'' and ''actus reus'' have been replaced by alternative terminology. In Australia, ''mens rea'' is now called "fault elements" or "mental elements" and ''actus reus'' is now called "physical elements" or "external elements". The point of the changes was to replace Latin with plain English.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Fisse, "Howard's Criminal Law" (1990) 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|43|1997|litigants=Meyers v R |courtname=auto}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levels of ''mens rea'' ==

Under the traditional common law, the guilt or innocence of a person relied upon whether he had committed the crime (''[[actus reus]]''), and whether he intended to commit the crime (''mens rea''). However, many modern penal codes have created levels of ''mens rea'' called modes of culpability, which depend on the surrounding elements of the crime: the conduct, the circumstances, and the result, or what the Model Penal Code calls CAR (conduct, [[attendant circumstance]]s, result). The definition of a crime is thus constructed using only these elements rather than the colorful language of ''mens rea'':{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|p=46}}

{{quote|Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.|18 U.S.C. §1111 (traditional common law)}}

{{quote|A person commits an offense if he:                                        &lt;br&gt;(1)  intentionally or [[knowingly]] causes the death of an
individual|''portion of'' [[Texas Penal Code]] §19.02 (modern offense element)}}

The traditional common law definitions and the modern definitions approach the crime from different angles.

In the traditional common law approach, the definition includes:

#''actus reus'': unlawful killing of a human being;
#''mens rea'': malice aforethought.

Modern law approaches the analysis somewhat differently. Homicide is a "results" crime in that it forbids ''any'' "intentional" or "knowing" conduct that ''results'' in the death of another human being. "Intentional" in this sense means the actor possessed a "purpose" or "desire" that his or her objective (i.e. death of another human being) be achieved. "Knowing" means that the actor was aware or practically certain that the death would result. Thus, the ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' of homicide in a modern criminal statute can be considered as follows:

#''actus reus'': any conduct resulting in the death of another individual;
#''mens rea'': intent or knowledge that the conduct would result in the death.

In the modern approach, the attendant circumstances tend to replace the traditional ''mens rea'', indicating the level of culpability as well as other circumstances. For example, the crime of ''theft of government property'' would include as an attendant circumstance that the property belong to the government.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|p=46}}

== Modes of culpability ==

The levels of ''mens rea'' and the distinction between them vary between jurisdictions. Although common law originated from England, the common law of each jurisdiction with regard to culpability varies as precedents and statutes vary.

===England and Wales===
*''Direct intention'': the actor has a clear foresight of the consequences of his actions, and desires those consequences to occur. It's his aim or purpose to achieve this consequence (death).
*''Oblique intention'': the result is a virtually certain consequence or a 'virtual certainty' of the defendant's actions, and that the defendant appreciates that such was the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[R v Nedrick]] [1986] 1 WLR 1025&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R v Woollin]] [1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Matthews &amp; Alleyne [2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Knowingly'': the actor knows, or should know, that the results of his conduct are reasonably certain to occur.
*''Recklessness'': the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not.&lt;ref&gt;R v Cunningham [1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v G &amp; R [2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Caldwell [1982]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Criminal negligence'': the actor did not actually foresee that the particular consequences would flow from his actions, but a [[reasonable person]], in the same circumstances, would have foreseen those consequences.

===Scotland===
*''Intention'': the accused willingly committed a criminal act entirely aware of his actions and their consequences. Necessary for murder and for assault.
*''Recklessness'': the accused was aware the criminal act could be potentially dangerous but did not give a second thought to its consequences, for example, involuntary [[culpable homicide]].

===United States===

====State criminal law====
The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in the United States are carried out by the [[U.S. state|component states]] in accordance with the laws of the state in question. Historically, the states (with the partial exception of [[civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] [[Louisiana]]) applied common law rules of ''mens rea'' similar to those extant in England, but over time American understandings of common law ''mens rea'' terms diverged from those of English law and from each other. By the late 1950s to early 1960s, the common law of ''mens rea'' was widely acknowledged to be a slippery, vague, and confused mess.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|pages=60-80}} This was one of several factors that led to the development of the Model Penal Code.

=====Model Penal Code=====
Since its publication in 1957, the formulation of ''mens rea'' set forth in the [[Model Penal Code]] has been highly influential throughout the US in clarifying the discussion of the different modes of culpability.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|pages=60-80}}  The following levels of ''mens rea'' are found in the MPC:

*''[[Strict liability]]'': the actor engaged in conduct and his mental state is irrelevant. Under Model Penal Code Section 2.05, this ''mens rea'' may only be applied where the forbidden conduct is a mere violation, i.e. a [[civil infraction]].
*''[[Criminal negligence|Negligently]]'': a "reasonable person" would be aware of a "substantial and unjustifiable risk" that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, will lead to a prohibited result, and/or is under prohibited attendant circumstances, and the actor was not so aware but should have been.
*''[[Recklessness (law)|Recklessly]]'': the actor consciously disregards a "substantial and unjustifiable risk" that his conduct will lead to a prohibited result and/or is of a prohibited nature.
*''Knowingly'': the actor is practically certain that his conduct will lead to the result, or is aware to a high probability that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, or is aware to a high probability that the attendant circumstances exist.
*''Purposefully'': the actor has the "conscious object" of engaging in conduct and believes or hopes that the attendant circumstances exist.

Except for strict liability, these classes of ''mens rea'' are defined in Section 2.02(2) of the MPC.

====Federal criminal law====
Since the federal government of the United States does not have a generalized [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] like that of the states, the scope of its criminal statutes is necessarily circumscribed.  Ordinary prosecutions are the province of the states, and only crimes of special federal import are pursued by the federal government. Consequently, Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] does not use the aforementioned culpability scheme but relies instead on more traditional definitions of crimes taken from common law. For example, ''malice aforethought'' is used as a requirement for committing capital murder.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|p=55}}

=== Canada ===

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has found that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees a minimum requirement for the mental state of various crimes. For example, the crime of murder must include a mental requirement of at least subjective foresight of death. For crimes where imprisonment is a sanction, there is a requirement of at least a defence of due diligence.

=== Australia ===

Mens rea needs to be proved by prosecution from offence to offence. If it is a common law offence, mens rea is found out by relevant precedent (''DPP v Morgan'' [1976] AC 182). Where the offence is in legislation, the requisite mens rea is found by interpreting the intention of the legislation.&lt;ref name="Teh HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|43|1985|litigants=[[He Kaw Teh v R]] |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 523 |courtname=auto |date=11 July 1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|2008|litigants=CTM v R |parallelcite=(2008) 236 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 440 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They must intend to commit the full offence.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|56|1992|litigants=Knight v R |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 495 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Mens Rea in the [[Indian Penal Code]] 1860 sets out the definition of offences, the general conditions of liability, the conditions of exemptions from liability and punishments for the respective offences. Legislatures had not used the common law doctrine of mens rea in defining these crimes. However, they preferred to import it by using different terms indicating the required evil intent or mens rea as an essence of a particular offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcrhrdi.gov.in/drugs/week2/Iindian%20Penal%20Code.pdf|title=INDIAN PENAL CODE|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Resource Development Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt in respect to almost all offences created under the IPC is fastened either on the ground of intention, knowledge or reason to believe. Almost all the offences under the IPC are qualified by one or other words such as ‘wrongful gain or loss’, ‘[[dishonesty]]’, ‘[[Fraudulent|fraudulently]]’, ‘reason to believe’, ‘criminal knowledge or intention’, ‘intentional cooperation’, ‘voluntarily’, ‘malignantly’, ‘wantonly’, ‘maliciously’. All these words indicate the blameworthy mental condition required at the time of commission of the offence, nowhere found in the IPC, its essence is reflected in almost all the provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860. Every offence created under the IPC virtually imports the idea of criminal intent or mens rea in some form or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/34296/12/12_chapter%20v.pdf|title=12_CHAPTER v|last=|first=|date=|website=Shodhganga : a reservoir of Indian theses @ INFLIBNET|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ignorance of the law and ''mens rea'' ==

The general rule under common law is that "ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek v. United States'', {{ussc|498|192|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, courts have held if knowledge of a law, or the intent to break a law, is a material element of an offense a defendant may use ignorance as a defense to willfulness if his misunderstanding is in good faith:

{{quote|The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [T]he Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term "willfully" as used in federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule."&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', at 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crimes like tax evasion are specific intent crimes and require intent to violate the law as an element of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', at 194&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R. v. Klundert'', for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal found as follows:

:"[55] Section 239(1)(d) is part of an Act which is necessarily and notoriously complex. It is subject to ongoing revision. No lay person is expected to know all the complexities of the tax laws. It is accepted that people will act on the advice of professionals and that the advice will often turn on the meanings to be given to provisions in the Act that are open to various interpretations. Furthermore, it is accepted that one may legitimately structure one’s affairs so as to minimize tax liability. Considered in this legislative context, I have no difficulty in holding that a mistake or ignorance as to one’s liability to pay tax under the Act may negate the fault requirement in the provision, regardless of whether it is a factual mistake, a legal mistake, or a combination of both."

Not all offenses require specific intent, and a misreading, even in good faith, may not excuse the criminal conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Marrero'', {{West|NE|507|2|1068|N.Y.|1987|}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good-faith belief that a law is unjust or unconstitutional is no excuse,&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', at 205-7&lt;/ref&gt; but "reasonable compliance upon an official statement of law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous" does not constitute a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Godwin'', {{West|SE|31||221|N.C.|1898|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a law must be worded as such, that it affords that a reasonable person who is not an attorney is able to comprehend the specific acts that the law prohibits. Otherwise, the statute may be struck down as unconstitutional pursuant to the [[Vagueness doctrine]].

== Subjective and objective tests ==

The test for the existence of ''mens rea'' may be:
:(a) subjective, where the court must be satisfied that the accused actually had the requisite mental element present in his or her mind at the relevant time (for purposely, knowingly, recklessly etc) (see [[concurrence]]);
:(b) objective, where the requisite ''mens rea'' element is [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the accused, on the basis that a reasonable person would have had the mental element in the same circumstances (for negligence); or
:(c) hybrid, where the test is both subjective and objective.

The [[court]] will have little difficulty in establishing ''mens rea'' if there is actual [[evidence (law)|evidence]]{{spaced ndash}}for instance, if the accused made an admissible [[admission (law)|admission]]. This would satisfy a ''subjective'' test. But a significant proportion of those accused of crimes make no such admissions. Hence, some degree of objectivity must be brought to bear as the basis upon which to impute the necessary component(s). It is always reasonable to assume that people of ordinary intelligence are aware of their physical surroundings and of the ordinary laws of cause and effect (see [[causation (law)|causation]]). Thus, when a person plans what to do and what not to do, he will understand the range of likely outcomes from given behaviour on a sliding scale from "inevitable" to "probable" to "possible" to "improbable". The more an outcome shades towards the "inevitable" end of the scale, the more likely it is that the accused both foresaw and desired it, and, therefore, the safer it is to impute intention. If there is clear subjective evidence that the accused did ''not'' have foresight, but a reasonable person would have, the hybrid test may find criminal negligence. In terms of the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], the requirement is that a [[jury]] must have a high degree of certainty before convicting, defined as "beyond a reasonable doubt" in the United States and "sure" in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Winship'', {{ussc|397|358|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Majid'' [2009] EWCA Crim 2563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crown Bench Book: Directing the Jury|year=2010|publisher=Judicial Studies Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this reasoning that justifies the defenses of [[defense of infancy|infancy]], and of lack of mental capacity under the [[M'Naghten Rules]], an alternate common law rule (e.g., ''Durham'' test), and one of various statutes defining [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|mental illness]] as an [[excuse]]. Moreover, if there is an [[irrebuttable presumption]] of ''[[doli incapax]]''  - that is, that the accused did not have sufficient understanding of the nature and quality of his actions{{spaced ndash}}then the requisite ''mens rea'' is absent no matter what degree of probability might otherwise have been present.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Devon T.'', {{West|A|584|2|1287|Md. Court App.|1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these purposes, therefore, where the relevant statutes are silent and it is for the common law to form the basis of potential liability, the reasonable person must be endowed with the same intellectual and physical qualities as the accused, and the test must be whether an accused with these specific attributes would have had the requisite foresight and desire.

In [[English law]], s8 Criminal Justice Act 1967 provides a statutory framework within which ''mens rea'' is assessed. It states:&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice Act 1967 (c.80)&lt;/ref&gt;
:A court or jury, in determining whether a person has committed an offense,
::(a) shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reasons only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions; but
::(b) shall decide whether he did intend or foresee that result by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances.
Under s8(b) therefore, the jury is allowed a wide latitude in applying a hybrid test to impute intention or foresight (for the purposes of recklessness) on the basis of all the evidence.

== Relevance of motive ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

One of the mental components often raised in issue is that of [[Motive (law)|motive]]. If the accused admits to having a motive consistent with the elements of foresight and desire, this will add to the level of probability that the actual outcome was intended (it makes the prosecution case more [[credibility|credible]]). But if there is clear evidence that the accused had a different motive, this may decrease the probability that he or she desired the actual outcome. In such a situation, the motive may become subjective evidence that the accused did not intend, but was reckless or willfully blind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Motive cannot be a defense.&lt;ref&gt;Hessick, Carrisa (2006). "Motive's Role in Criminal Punishment". Southern California Law Review. Retrieved October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, a person breaks into a laboratory used for the testing of pharmaceuticals on animals, the question of guilt is determined by the presence of an ''actus reus'', i.e. entry without consent and damage to property, and a ''mens rea'', i.e. intention to enter and cause the damage. That the person might have had a clearly articulated political motive to protest such testing does not affect liability. If motive has any relevance, this may be addressed in the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] part of the trial, when the court considers what [[punishment]], if any, is appropriate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

== Intention ==
{{main|Intention (criminal law)}}

== Recklessness (United States: "willful blindness") ==
{{main|Recklessness (law)|Willful blindness}}

In such cases, there is clear subjective evidence that the accused foresaw but did not desire the particular outcome.  When the accused failed to stop the given behavior, he took the risk of causing the given loss or damage.  There is always some degree of intention subsumed within recklessness.  During the course of the conduct, the accused foresees that he may be putting another at risk of injury:  A choice must be made at that point in time.  By deciding to proceed, the accused actually intends the other to be exposed to the risk of that injury.  The greater the probability of that risk maturing into the foreseen injury, the greater the degree of recklessness and, subsequently, sentence rendered.  For example, at common law, an unlawful homicide committed recklessly would ordinarily constitute the crime of [[voluntary manslaughter]].  One committed with ''"extreme"'' or ''"gross"'' recklessness as to human life would constitute murder, sometimes defined as ''"depraved heart"'' or ''"abandoned and malignant heart"'' murder.&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code §§ 188-199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal negligence ==
{{main|Criminal negligence}}

Here, the test is both subjective and objective. There is credible subjective evidence that the particular accused neither foresaw nor desired the particular outcome, thus potentially excluding both intention and recklessness. But a [[reasonable person]] with the same abilities and skills as the accused would have foreseen and taken precautions to prevent the loss and damage being sustained. Only a small percentage of offences are defined with this ''mens rea'' requirement. Most [[legislature]]s prefer to base liability on either intention or recklessness and, faced with the need to establish recklessness as the default ''mens rea'' for guilt, those practising in most legal systems rely heavily on objective tests to establish the minimum requirement of foresight for recklessness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">'''Negative refraction''' is the name for an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] phenomenon where [[light]] [[ray (optics)|rays]] are [[refraction|refracted]] at an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] in the reverse sense to that normally expected.  Such an effect can be obtained using a [[metamaterial]] which has been designed to achieve a [[negative number|negative]] value for both (electric) [[permittivity]] ε and (magnetic) [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] μ, as in such cases the material can be assigned a negative [[refractive index]]. Such materials are sometimes called "double negative" materials.

Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive [[phase velocity]] (i.e. a positive [[refractive index]]), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative [[refractive index]]).

==Negative phase velocity==

Negative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a [[optical medium|medium]].  There are different definitions of NPV, the most common being Veselago's original proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veselago|first=Viktor G|date=1968-04-30|title=THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTANCES WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY NEGATIVE VALUES OF $\epsilon$ AND μ|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1070%2FPU1968v010n04ABEH003699|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514|doi=10.1070/pu1968v010n04abeh003699|issn=0038-5670}}&lt;/ref&gt; of opposition of [[wavevector]] and (Abraham)  [[Poynting vector]], i.e. E×H; other common choices are opposition of [[wavevector]] to [[group velocity]], or to [[energy velocity]]. The use of "phase velocity" in the naming convention, as opposed to the perhaps more appropriate "wave vector", follows since phase velocity has the same sign as the wavevector.

A typical criterion used to determine Veselago NPV is that the dot product of the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector is negative (i.e. that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{P}\cdot\vec{k}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;); however this definition is not [[General covariance|covariant]].  Whilst this restriction is rarely of practical significance, the criterion has nevertheless been generalized into a covariant form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. W. McCall|doi=10.1016/j.metmat.2008.05.001|title=A Covariant Theory of Negative Phase Velocity Propagation|journal=Metamaterials|volume=2|issue=2–3|page=92|year=2008|bibcode = 2008MetaM...2...92M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For plane waves propagating in a Veselago NPV medium, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, rather than the usual right-hand rule.  This gives rise to the name "left-handed (meta)materials". However, the terms left-handed and right-handed can also arise in the study of chiral media, so this terminology is best avoided.

== Negative refractive index ==
[[Image:metarefraction.svg|thumb|A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal material]]
[[File:Negative refraction.ogv|thumb|Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface.]]

We can choose to avoid directly considering the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector or a propagating light field, and consider instead the response of the materials directly: that is, we consider what values of permittivity ε and permeability µ result in [[#Negative phase velocity|negative phase velocity]] (NPV).  Since both ε and µ are in general complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. [[Attenuation|lossy]]) material to display negative refraction.  The most general [[Victor Veselago|Veselago]] criterion applying to ε and µ is that of Depine and [[Akhlesh Lakhtakia|Lakhtakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = R. A. Depine and A. Lakhtakia |doi = 10.1002/mop.20127 |title = A new condition to identify isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials displaying negative phase velocity |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 41 |issue = 4 |pages = 315–316 |year = 2004 |arxiv = physics/0311029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other less general forms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = P. Kinsler and M. W. McCall |doi = 10.1002/mop.23489 |title = Criteria for negative refraction in active and passive media |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 50 |issue = 7 |page = 1804 |year = 2008 |arxiv = 0806.1676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Depine-Lakhtakia criterion for negative phase velocity is

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r|\mu|+ \mu_r |\epsilon| &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r, \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; are the real valued parts of ε and µ, respectively. However, negative refraction (negative refractive index) and negative phase velocity can be distinct from each other, even in passive materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Tom G.|last2=Lakhtakia|first2=Akhlesh|date=2009-06-12|title=Negative refraction, negative phase velocity, and counterposition in bianisotropic materials and metamaterials|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121|journal=Physical Review B|volume=79|issue=23|pages=235121|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = J. Skaar |doi = 10.1364/OL.31.003372 |title = On resolving the refractive index and the wave vector |journal = [[Optics Letters]] |volume = 31 |issue = 22 |pages = 3372–3374 |year = 2006 |arxiv = physics/0607104 |bibcode = 2006OptL...31.3372S |citeseerx = 10.1.1.261.8030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the [[refractive index]] ''n'' is determined using &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n =\pm\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, where by convention the positive square root is chosen for ''n''.  However, in NPV materials, we reverse that convention and pick the negative sign to mimic the fact that the wavevector (and hence phase velocity) are likewise reversed.  Strictly speaking, the refractive index is a derived quantity telling us how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light, thus the sign of ''n'' must be chosen to match the physical situation.

==Refraction==
The principal symptom of negative refraction is just that – light rays are 
refracted on the ''same'' side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a suitably general form of [[Snell's law]].

In [[statistics]], there is a '''negative relationship''' or '''inverse relationship''' between two variables if higher values of one variable tend to be associated with lower values of the other. A negative relationship between two variables usually implies that the [[correlation]] between them is negative, or &amp;mdash; what is in some contexts equivalent &amp;mdash; that the [[slope]] in a corresponding graph is negative. A '''negative correlation''' between variables is also called '''anticorrelation''' or '''inverse correlation'''.

Negative correlation can be seen geometrically when two normalized [[random vector]]s are viewed as points on a sphere, and the [[Pearson correlation coefficient#Geometric interpretation|correlation]] between them is the [[cosine]] of the arc of separation of the points on the sphere.&lt;ref&gt; R. J. Rummel [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/UC.HTM Understanding Correlation] from [[University of Hawaii]]&lt;/ref&gt; When this arc is more than a quarter-circle (&amp;theta; &gt; &amp;pi;/2), then the cosine is negative. [[Diametrically opposed]] points represent a correlation of –1 = cos(&amp;pi;). Any two points not in the same hemisphere have negative correlation.

An example would be a negative [[cross-sectional]] relationship between illness and vaccination, if it is observed that where the incidence of one is higher than average, the incidence of the other tends to be lower than average. Similarly, there would be a negative [[time series|temporal]] relationship between illness and vaccination if it is observed in one location that times with a higher-than-average incidence of one tend to coincide with a lower-than-average incidence of the other.

A particular inverse relationship is called [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inverse proportionality]], and is given by &lt;math&gt;y = k/x &lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' &gt; 0 is a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. In a [[Cartesian plane]] this relationship is displayed as a [[hyperbola]] with ''y'' decreasing as ''x'' increases.&lt;ref&gt;The [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\ y \prime = \frac{-k}{x^2} \ &lt;/math&gt; is negative for [[positive real numbers]] ''x'' and as well for negative real numbers. Thus the slope is everywhere negative except at the [[singular point of a curve|singularity]] ''x'' = 0.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[finance]], an inverse correlation between the [[rate of return|returns]] on two different assets enhances the [[financial risk|risk]]-reduction effect of  [[diversification (finance)|diversifying]] by holding them both in the same portfolio.

'''Non-fatal offences against the person''',  under [[English law]], are generally taken to mean offences which take the form of an attack directed at another person, that do not result in the death of any person. Such offences where death occurs are considered [[Homicide in English law|homicide]], whilst [[Sexual offences in the United Kingdom|sexual offences]] are generally considered separately, since they differ substantially from other offences against the person in theoretical basis and composition. Non-fatal offences against the person mainly derive from the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], although no definition of assault or battery is given there.

[[Offences against the person]] include minor forms of [[battery (crime)|battery]] (any unlawful touching of another person); its complimentary offence, [[assault]] (causing the apprehension of a battery, even when one has not yet occurred); and various more serious offences which are based on assault and battery (together called "common assault"). This includes [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]], where the victim suffers injuries such as bruising or skin abrasions (the converse being an injury that is "transient and trifling"); wounding (a piercing of all layers of the skin); and causing grievous bodily harm (injuries more serious than in actual bodily harm, for example broken bones). The latter two offences may be committed "with intent", meaning there is an additional ''[[mens rea]]'' component that makes the defendant more culpable for their actions. Whilst [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] is sufficient for most offences against the person &amp;ndash; that the defendant foresaw the risk of the proscribed injury occurring without necessarily intending it to happen &amp;ndash; this is insufficient for crimes of intent.

==General characteristics==
[[File:Non-fatal offences against the person graph.png|thumb|right|250px|Number of recorded crimes (2009&amp;ndash;10). Categories approximate non-fatal offences against the person.]]
Common to all crimes against the person is the infringement of the right to [[bodily integrity]]. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no [[harm principle|physical harm]] actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the [[right to liberty]].&lt;ref name="simester425"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the [[right to privacy]] under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="simester425"/&gt; The central statute on this topic is [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.&lt;ref name="simester425"/&gt;

In the context of the [[inchoate offences in English law|law of attempts]], the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] advises that "where the evidence demonstrates that the suspect intended to cause an injury that is substantially more serious than that (if any) which was in fact caused, prosecutors should consider the circumstances of the case as a whole as well as the relevant sentencing guideline to determine the appropriate charge." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/ |title=Offences Against The Person |accessdate=5 July 2013 |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assault and battery==
A distinction is drawn between the offence of [[assault]] and that of [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault is the ''apprehension'' of the possibility of immediate unlawful violence, and battery that of the ''infliction'' of such violence. Several proposals, including one from the [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] in 1980 have proposed merging the offences. However, the distinction was confirmed in ''[[DPP v Little]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1992] QB 645 (DC)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992. There, the [[conflation]] of assault and battery was criticised as [[Duplicity (law)|duplicitous]].&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith412"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; If D throws a punch at V, who dodges, this is likely to be an assault but not a battery; if V is attacked from behind, this may constitute a battery without an assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 426&amp;ndash;427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith413"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Actions which constitute ordinary daily life are not considered assault or battery, for example, jostling on a crowded train.&lt;ref name="simester428"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "common assault" is used to refer to either a technical assault or a battery.&lt;ref name="smith412"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpscharging"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P92_3540 |title=Offences against the Person, incorporating the Charging Standard |publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]] |year=2009 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assault===
{{main|Common assault}}
Assault is a [[summary offence]] in England and Wales, with the case heard only at a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]].&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith415"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''R v Little'' considered assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault.&lt;ref name="smith413"/&gt; The ''[[actus reus]]'', endorsed in ''[[R v Ireland]]'',&lt;ref name="ireland" group="c"&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 427&amp;ndash;428.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "force" rather than "violence" is used by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS).&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt; As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied.&lt;ref name="simester428"/&gt; The force must be unlawful &amp;ndash; outside the realm of [[Self-defence in English law|defensive]] or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the ''actus reus'', making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. [[Andrew Simester]] and [[Bob Sullivan (legal writer)|Bob Sullivan]] argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's [[autonomy]] and privacy is the actionable part of the offence.&lt;ref name="simester428"/&gt; The victim need not be frightened by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the person concerned to do it.&lt;ref name="simester429"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault requires a positive act, not an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]]. Mere lawful presence in a location is not enough to satisfy the conduct requirement; illegal [[trespass to land|trespass]], however, is sufficient.&lt;ref name="simester429"/&gt; [[John Cyril Smith]] has suggested that wilfully refusing to retract an inadvertent act that causes the victim to apprehend violence may constitute an assault by omission.&lt;ref name="smith415"/&gt; It is arguable that there was once a rule that "mere words" could not constitute an assault, but the case of ''R v Ireland'' confirmed that even silent phone calls would be grounds for the charge of assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 429&amp;ndash;430.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elliott139"&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[R. v Constanza]]'' added threatening letters to this category.&lt;ref name="elliott139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester430"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although assault involves a threat of an immediate battery, the perpetrator need not actually intend to carry out that battery.&lt;ref name="smith414"/&gt; It is enough that he, intentionally or recklessly, caused the victim to apprehend such an occurrence.&lt;ref name="simester430"/&gt; The term "immediate" has also been used in different ways. Following ''Ireland'', it seems likely that even where the victim knew the defendant was some distance away, this may be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lord Steyn]] said there, "what, if not the possibility of imminent personal violence, was the victim terrified about?".&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 430&amp;ndash;431.&lt;/ref&gt; This would widen the crime of assault considerably. It is perfectly conceivable that the victim was fearful, but did not believe an attack was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; That she actually apprehended "immediate violence", rather than merely "immediately apprehended", is doubtful.&lt;ref name="smith414"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Constanza'', it was sufficient for the prosecution to show that the victim feared an attack in the future, which may have been imminent. It also suggested that the anticipated harm could be psychological rather than physical.&lt;ref name="elliott142"&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Blake v Barnard]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1840) 9 C &amp; P 626; 173 [[English Reports|ER]] 985&lt;/ref&gt; established a rule that conditional threats could not amount to an assault. However, the court's reliance on ''[[Tuberville v Savage]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1669) 1 Mod Rep 3; 86 ER 684&lt;/ref&gt; was tenuous at best. Such threats would normally be considered assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 431&amp;ndash;432.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mens rea'' requirement is that the defendant must have intend to, or recklessly, cause the victim to fear the possibility of immediate unlawful violence.&lt;ref name="simester432"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no authority that suggests that "intend" or "recklessly" ought to mean something from their normal meanings. ''[[Recklessness (law)|Cunningham recklessness]]'' &amp;ndash; that the defendant himself foresaw the risk of harm &amp;ndash; is applied.&lt;ref name="elliott142"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt; Assault is a crime of "basic intent" for the purposes of the [[Majewski test]] concerning [[Voluntary intoxication in English law|voluntary intoxication]].&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt;

===Battery===
The defendant commits a [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if they intentionally or recklessly apply unlawful force to another, without their consent.&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt; It is subject to the same "everyday life" exception common to assault.&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith416"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases have included kissing,&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Dungey (1864) 4 F&amp;F 99, 102; 176 ER 487&lt;/ref&gt; spitting&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Smith (1866) F&amp;F 1066; 176 ER 910&lt;/ref&gt; and cutting someone's hair without their consent.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (admin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 432&amp;ndash;433.&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes contact with the victim's clothing,&lt;ref name="simester433"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; a rule dating back to 1845 in ''[[R v Day]]''. It is not necessary that the victim feels the touching.&lt;ref name="smith416"/&gt;

The required [[causation (law)|causation]] may be quite oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense of panic.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Martin (1881) 8 QBD 54 (CCR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt; The general law on [[Omissions in English criminal law|liability for omissions]] also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner|Fagan v MPC]]'') and of a [[duty of care]].&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt; However, in ''R v Ireland''&lt;ref name="ireland" group="c"/&gt; the court ruled out psychological injury by means of a telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought.&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith417"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.&lt;ref name="smith417"/&gt;

The case of ''[[R v Brown]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1994] 1 AC 212&lt;/ref&gt; established a further requirement: hostility. This is not easily called an ''actus reus'' nor ''mens rea'' requirement. It was not clear what role it played in that case, but could apply to other cases as a way of clarifying the "everyday behaviour" guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been strongly criticised by [[Lord Goff]] and other judicial and academic writers. It could apply to future cases where the bodily harm was unintended or unforeseen.&lt;ref name="simester435"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mens rea'' requirement for battery is similar to assault. It is the intention to apply unlawful force to another, or be reckless as to whether such force is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; It employs ''[[Recklessness (law)|Cunningham recklessness]]'' &amp;ndash; that the defendant must have foreseen the risk of the infliction of unlawful force upon V.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 418&amp;ndash;419.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, at least, combining the ''mens rea'' of battery with the ''actus reus'' of assault, or vice versa, is not a crime.&lt;ref name="smith419"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Majewski test]] is applied to cases of voluntary intoxication, as battery is also a crime of "basic intent" in this scenario.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith419"/&gt;

==Assault occasioning actual bodily harm==
[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] carries a maximum sentence of 5 years under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/47 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 47 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[triable either way]].&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith436"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Both assault (fear of violence) and battery (infliction of violence) are included,&lt;ref name="simester436"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible to consider section 47 as creating two offences &amp;ndash; one involving an assault, and one a battery.&lt;ref name="smith436"/&gt; "Occasioning" is generally taken to mean "causing" although [[John Gardner (lawyer)|John Gardner]] has argued that it is wider than that.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; In discussing causation, 'frightened' people are not expected to act entirely rationally; instead, a relevant test is that of ''[[R v Roberts]]''.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;56 Cr App R 95 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt; There, any conduct of the victim short of "daft" could be considered caused by the defendant's actions.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; Only the seriousness of the injury separates an assault from an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;

The concept of "actual bodily harm" is wide. Almost all injuries are included &amp;ndash; for example, [[bruising]] or [[Abrasion (medical)|skin abrasion]]s. Injuries are not included if they are "transient or trifling",&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498 CCA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt; but this did not cover even momentary unconsciousness.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;T v DPP [2003] EWHC 266 (admin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; The wide range of injuries give prosecutors considerable discretion about which charge to bring against a defendant.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; Psychological injury is included,&lt;ref name="smith437"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it forms a recognised medical condition.&lt;ref name="simester436437"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 436&amp;ndash;437.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere fright or anxiety is insufficient for actual bodily harm.&lt;ref name="smith437"/&gt; It is limited only by the need for an actual assault or battery to have taken place.&lt;ref name="simester436437"/&gt;

There is no separate ''mens rea'' element from the assault or battery, making this a crime of [[constructive liability]].&lt;ref name="smith436"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester437"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been defended by John Gardner, a proponent of the [[moral threshold]] theory.&lt;ref name="simester437"/&gt; However, this is opposed by Simester and Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 437&amp;ndash;438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maliciously wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm==
{{main|Grievous bodily harm}}
Section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 criminalises "whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 20 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty, five years, is the same as that for actual bodily harm, but a section 20 offence is considered more serious by the courts and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref name="simester438"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge is free on the facts of the case to allow a jury find a defendant guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm where a defendant is charged with a section 20 offence.&lt;ref name="smith438"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''actus reus'' is the wound or infliction of grievous bodily harm (GBH). A "wound" is something that breaks all layers of the [[skin]], and must have an external component &amp;ndash; [[internal bleeding]], however serious, is not a wound.&lt;ref name="simster438439"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 438&amp;ndash;439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith439"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; Serious wounds would also fall under grievous bodily harm, but some qualifying wounds (a pin prick, for example) are very minor.&lt;ref name="simster438439"/&gt; Some wounds would therefore not qualify as grievous bodily harm.&lt;ref name="smith439"/&gt;

The phrase "really serious harm" was used to describe grievous bodily harm in ''R v Metheram''.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1961] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester438"/&gt; The case of ''R v Grundy''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1977] Crim LR 543&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that injuries should be taken in their totality; that many small injuries may form a serious harm.&lt;ref name="simster438439"/&gt; ''R v Bollom''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2004] 2 Cr App R 50&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the ''Grundy'' approach, and also showed that grievous bodily harm against a child was likely to require less bodily harm than that against an adult. ''[[R v Burstow]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; extended "bodily harm" to include psychological trauma if it formed a recognised serious mental condition. Simester ''et al'' said that this could have wide-reaching consequences, but it is unlikely to be taken to include commonplace occurrences (relationship breakups, verbal cruelty, broken promises) &amp;ndash; in ''Burstow'', the conduct included a prolonged and intense campaign of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, ''[[R v Clarence]]'' was taken as an authority on the meaning of "inflict", which the court took to mean "an assault or battery of which a wound or grievous bodily harm is the manifest immediate and obvious result".&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1888) 22 QBD 23&lt;/ref&gt; This narrow definition was extended in ''R v Martin''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1881) 8 QBD 54&lt;/ref&gt; and ''R v Halliday''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1886&amp;ndash;90] All ER 1028&lt;/ref&gt; to include, for example, injuries sustained during an attempt of the victim to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; An injury is said to be "inflicted" if it is the result of an impact or percussion set in motion by the defendant; the injury must relate directly to the impact or percussion, but the impact or percussion may be an indirect effect of the defendant's actions.&lt;ref name="simester441"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; ''R v Burstow'' established that "inflict" was a near synonym of cause: in [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]]'s view, they were synonymous, except that the outcome of the former must be unpleasant.&lt;ref name="smith441"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied in ''[[R v Dica]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2004] QB 1257&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[R v Konzani]]'',&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2005] EWCA Crim 706&lt;/ref&gt; two cases of [[Criminal transmission of HIV|knowingly risking passing on HIV]] without explicit consent.&lt;ref name="simester441"/&gt;

The ''mens rea'' element is that of "malice", which means either intention or recklessness.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 441&amp;ndash;442.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cunningham recklessness'' is applied.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Savage [1992] 1 AC 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith441"/&gt; However, for the purposes of recklessness, foresight of even minor harm is sufficient &amp;ndash; it does not require foresight of serious harm.&lt;ref name="smith441"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester442"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised since it breaks the correspondence principle, that the ''mens rea'' should match the ''actus reus'' of an offence.&lt;ref name="simester442"/&gt;

==Wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent==
The crime of [[Grievous bodily harm#Section 18|wounding with intent]] is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. It reads, since amended, as:
"Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person... with intent...  to do some...  grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/18 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 18 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates four forms of the offence: unlawfully and maliciously wounding, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (1) or resist arrest (2); and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (3) or resist arrest (4).&lt;ref name="simester442"/&gt; Thus forms (1) and (3) differ from section 20 offences mainly in that there is a specific intention to cause serious harm rather than some harm, and they are therefore the more serious charges. On an [[indictment]] under section 18, the jury is open to convict under section 20 or section 47 if properly directed.&lt;ref name="smith438"/&gt;

"Wounding" and "causing grievous bodily harm" are defined in the same way as they are in the crime of maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm includes serious psychological trauma and serious infection; however, these are less controversial here because of the inclusion of intent.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 442&amp;ndash;443.&lt;/ref&gt; Intent narrows the crime considerably, and the term "inflict" is not used.&lt;ref name="simester443"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In form (3), intent can be simply decided in the case of a direct attack, or "virtual certainty", with knowledge of the virtual certainty &amp;ndash; the ''[[R v Woollin|Woollin]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Woollin [1999] AC 82 (HL)&lt;/ref&gt; principle.&lt;ref name="simester443"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In form (1), where an injury does not amount to grievous bodily harm, intent to cause grievous bodily harm (in the advancement of a different cause) must be shown. Practically, the "virtual certainty" clause cannot come into force, since grievous bodily harm was not actually caused, by definition.&lt;ref name="simester443"/&gt; In forms (2) and (4), the concept of "malice" has a role to play that it does not in (1) and (3). The defendant must foresee the risk of wounding or grievous bodily harm, where the core intent is to resist arrest. The defendant cannot be reckless to the resisting of arrest, it must be an intention.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 443&amp;ndash;444.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the requirement to resist a ''lawful'' arrest, the defendant only lacks the required ''mens rea'' if he believes in facts which, if true, would make the arrest unlawful; not just that he believes the facts as they are make the arrest illegal &amp;ndash; a [[mistake of fact]] suffices, a [[mistake of law]] does not.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other offences and issues==
There also exist alternative forms of aggravated assault in English law, for example: assault or battery with intent to resist arrest (as above, the arrest must be lawful); and assault on, resistance to, and obstruction of [[constable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 426&amp;ndash;436.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], it is also possible to commit a racially aggravated assault. This is where the commission of the assault in combination to hostility towards the victim, based on their race or believed race, or association with a race. "Race" includes skin colour, nationality, citizenship, and ethnic or national origins.&lt;ref name="smith437"/&gt; Administering poison, either contrary to section 23 or 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, is also an offence; as is false imprisonment &amp;ndash; including unlawful arrest, kidnap and hostage situations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 443&amp;ndash;457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation aimed at the possession or use of firearms may also come into this category, as may [[bomb hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp.457&amp;ndash;465.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also offences of aggravated assault, created under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, that now go almost completely unused: for example, assaulting or obstructing a clergyman in the discharge of his duties, and assaulting a [[magistrate]] or other person in the exercise of his duties concerning the preservation of a vessel in distress or a wreck.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

An assault is not caused if a defendant threatens to shoot the victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, it would be the ''actus reus'' of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for [[attempted assault]]. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.&lt;ref name="smith415"/&gt;

The [[history of calculus]] is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of [[fluxion]]s or [[infinitesimal]] numbers. The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|epsilon–delta]] procedures rather than infinitesimals. '''Non-standard analysis'''&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis in Practice. Edited by [[Francine Diener]], [[Marc Diener]]. Springer, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis, Axiomatically. By [[V. Vladimir Grigorevich Kanovei]], [[Michael Reeken]]. Springer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis for the Working Mathematician. Edited by [[Peter A. Loeb]], [[Manfred P. H. Wolff]]. Springer, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of [[infinitesimal]] numbers.

Non-standard analysis was originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician [[Abraham Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Non-standard Analysis. By [[Abraham Robinson]]. Princeton University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcps.umn.edu/philosophy/11_7dauben.pdf Abraham Robinson and Nonstandard Analysis]: History, Philosophy, and Foundations of Mathematics. By [[Joseph W. Dauben]]. www.mcps.umn.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the idea of infinitely small or ''infinitesimal'' quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection [...] that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were ''to possess the same properties as the latter''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson argued that this [[law of continuity]] of Leibniz's is a precursor of the [[transfer principle]]. Robinson continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;[[Abraham Robinson|Robinson, A.]]: Non-standard analysis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is shown in this book that Leibniz's ideas can be fully vindicated and that they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary [[model theory]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, [[Intuitionism|intuitionist]] [[Arend Heyting]] praised non-standard analysis as "a standard model of important mathematical research".&lt;ref&gt;Heijting, A. (1973) Address to Professor A. Robinson. At the occasion of the Brouwer memorial lecture given by Prof. A.Robinson on the 26th April 1973. Nieuw Arch. Wisk. (3) 21, pp. 134—137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
A non-zero element of an [[ordered field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal if and only if its [[absolute value]] is smaller than any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called [[non-Archimedean ordered field|non-Archimedean]]. More generally, non-standard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on [[non-standard model]]s and the [[transfer principle]]. A field which satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is a [[hyperreal field]], and non-standard real analysis uses these fields as ''non-standard models'' of the real numbers.

Robinson's original approach was based on these non-standard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject ''Non-standard Analysis'' was published in 1966 and is still in print.&lt;ref name="NSA2"&gt;{{cite book| last=Robinson |first=Abraham|title=Non-standard analysis|year=1996|edition=Revised|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-04490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 88, Robinson writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The existence of non-standard models of arithmetic was discovered by [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1934). Skolem's method foreshadows the [[ultrapower]] construction [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article on [[hyperreal number]]s for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.

==Basic definitions==
In this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the field of real numbers, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[semiring]] of natural numbers. Denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; the set of sequences of real numbers. A field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a suitable quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, as follows. Take a nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] &lt;math&gt;F \subset P(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[Fréchet filter]]. Consider a pair of sequences

:&lt;math&gt;u = (u_n), v = (v_n) \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices which is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;\{n \in \mathbb{N} : u_n = v_n\} \in F&lt;/math&gt;

The quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, a situation summarized by the formula &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R} = {\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}}/{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Motivation==
There are at least three reasons to consider non-standard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.

===Historical===
Much of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as ''infinitesimal number'' and ''vanishing quantity''. As noted in the article on [[hyperreal number]]s, these formulations were widely criticized by [[George Berkeley]] and others. It was a challenge to develop a consistent theory of analysis using infinitesimals and the first person to do this in a satisfactory way was Abraham Robinson.&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt;

In 1958 Curt Schmieden and [[Detlef Laugwitz]] published an Article "Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung"&lt;ref&gt;Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz: ''Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung'', Mathematische Zeitschrift 69 (1958), 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; - "An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus", which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.

===Pedagogical===
[[H. Jerome Keisler]], [[David Tall]], and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|"epsilon-delta" approach]] to analytic concepts.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;H. Jerome Keisler, ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''. First edition 1976; 2nd edition 1986: [http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html full text of 2nd edition]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon-delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:

::infinitesimal × bounded = infinitesimal

::infinitesimal + infinitesimal = infinitesimal

together with the transfer principle mentioned below.

Another pedagogical application of non-standard analysis is [[Edward Nelson]]'s treatment of the theory of [[stochastic processes]].&lt;ref name="Ele"&gt;Edward Nelson: ''Radically Elementary Probability Theory'', Princeton University Press, 1987, [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/rept.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical===
Some recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from non-standard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. [[Sergio Albeverio]] et al.&lt;ref name="Alb"&gt;Sergio Albeverio, Jans Erik Fenstad, Raphael Høegh-Krohn, Tom Lindstrøm: ''Nonstandard Methods in Stochastic Analysis and Mathematical Physics'', Academic Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; discuss some of these applications.

==Approaches to non-standard analysis==
There are two very different approaches to non-standard analysis: the [[semantic]] or [[model-theoretic approach]] and the [[syntactic approach]]. Both these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.

Robinson's original formulation of non-standard analysis falls into the category of the ''semantic approach''. As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular [[saturated model]]s) of a [[theory]]. Since Robinson's work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to [[Elias Zakon]]) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called [[Universe (mathematics)|superstructures]]. In this approach ''a model of a theory'' is replaced by an object called a ''superstructure'' {{math|''V''(''S'')}} over a set {{mvar|S}}. Starting from a superstructure {{math|''V''(''S'')}} one constructs another object {{math|*''V''(''S'')}} using the [[ultrapower]] construction together with a mapping {{math|''V''(''S'') → *''V''(''S'')}} that satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. The map * relates formal properties of {{math|''V''(''S'')}} and {{math|*''V''(''S'')}}. Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called [[countable]] saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.

The ''syntactic approach'' requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician [[Edward Nelson]]. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of non-standard analysis that he called [[Internal Set Theory]] (IST).&lt;ref name="Nel"&gt;[[Edward Nelson]]: ''Internal Set Theory: A New Approach to Nonstandard Analysis'', Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 83, Number 6, November 1977. A chapter on Internal Set Theory is available at [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; IST is an extension of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation ∈, it introduces a new unary predicate ''standard'', which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.

Syntactic non-standard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the [[axiom of comprehension]]), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of ''[[illegal set formation]]''. For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here ''standard'' is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.&lt;ref name="Nel" /&gt;

Another example of the syntactic approach is the [[Alternative Set Theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Vopěnka, P. Mathematics in the Alternative Set Theory. Teubner, Leipzig, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by [[Vopěnka]], trying to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the non-standard analysis than the axioms of ZF.

==Robinson's book==
Abraham Robinson's book ''Non-standard analysis'' was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of non-standard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre–non-standard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]'s "sum theorem" in [[Cours d'Analyse]] concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.

==Invariant subspace problem==
Abraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used non-standard analysis to prove that every [[polynomially compact]] [[linear operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] has an [[invariant subspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen Bernstein and Abraham Robinson, [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1102994835 ''Solution of an invariant subspace problem of K. T. Smith and P. R. Halmos''], Pacific Journal of Mathematics 16:3 (1966) 421-431&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an operator {{mvar|T}} on Hilbert space {{mvar|''H''}}, consider the orbit of a point {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|H}} under the iterates of {{mvar|T}}. Applying Gram-Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{mvar|H}}. Let {{math|(''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} be the corresponding nested sequence of "coordinate" subspaces of {{mvar|H}}. The matrix {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} expressing {{mvar|T}} with respect to {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if {{mvar|T}} is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index {{mvar|w}} such that the matrix coefficient {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''w''+1,''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|*''H''}}. If {{mvar|y}} in {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has finite norm, then {{math|''T''(''y'')}} is infinitely close to {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Now let {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be the operator &lt;math&gt;P_w \circ T&lt;/math&gt; acting on {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the orthogonal projection to {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Denote by {{mvar|q}} the polynomial such that {{math|''q''(''T'')}} is compact. The subspace {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} where {{mvar|k}} runs from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|w}}, such that each of the corresponding {{mvar|k}}-dimensional subspaces {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{mvar|T}}-invariant. Denote by {{math|Π&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} the projection to the subspace {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For a nonzero vector {{mvar|x}} of finite norm in {{mvar|H}}, one can assume that {{math|''q''(''T'')(''x'')}} is nonzero, or {{math|{{!}}''q''(''T'')(''x''){{!}} &gt; 1}} to fix ideas. Since {{math|''q''(''T'')}} is a compact operator, {{math|(''q''(''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''))(''x'')}} is infinitely close to {{math|''q''(''T'')(''x'')}} and therefore one has also {{math|{{!}}''q''(''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'')(''x''){{!}} &gt; 1}}. Now let {{mvar|j}} be the greatest index such that &lt;math&gt;|q(T_w) \left (\Pi_j(x) \right)|&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the desired invariant subspace.

Upon reading a preprint of the Bernstein-Robinson paper, [[Paul Halmos]] reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques.&lt;ref&gt;P. Halmos, [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1102994836 ''Invariant subspaces for Polynomially Compact Operators''], Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 16:3 (1966) 433-437.&lt;/ref&gt; Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the ''Pacific Journal of Mathematics''. Some of the ideas used in Halmos' proof reappeared many years later in Halmos' own work on quasi-triangular operators.

==Other applications==
Other results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Kamae's proof&lt;ref&gt;T. Kamae: ''A simple proof of the ergodic theorem using nonstandard analysis'', Israel Journal of Mathematics vol. 42, Number 4, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[individual ergodic theorem]] or van den Dries and Wilkie's treatment&lt;ref&gt;L. van den Dries and A. J. Wilkie: ''Gromov's Theorem on Groups of Polynomial Growth and Elementary Logic'', Journal of Algebra, Vol 89, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and [[Shmuel Weinberger]] to prove a result in algebraic topology.&lt;ref&gt;Manevitz, Larry M.; Weinberger, Shmuel: Discrete circle actions: a note using non-standard analysis. Israel J. Math. 94 (1996), 147--155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The real contributions of non-standard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilizes the new extended language of non-standard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability &lt;ref name="Ele"/&gt;
hydrodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Capinski&amp;nbsp;M., [[Nigel Cutland|Cutland]]&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;J. ''Nonstandard Methods for Stochastic Fluid Mechanics.''
Singapore&amp;nbsp;etc., World Scientific Publishers (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; measure theory,&lt;ref&gt;Cutland N. ''[[Peter A. Loeb|Loeb]] Measures in Practice: Recent Advances.'' Berlin&amp;nbsp;etc.: Springer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; nonsmooth and harmonic analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon E. I., [[Semën Samsonovich Kutateladze|Kutateladze S. S.]], and Kusraev A. G. ''Infinitesimal Analysis'' Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

There are also applications of non-standard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et-al&lt;ref name="Alb" /&gt; have an excellent introduction to this area of research.

===Applications to calculus===
As an application to [[mathematical education]], [[H. Jerome Keisler]] wrote ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Covering [[non-standard calculus]], it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of non-standard analysis depend on the existence of the ''[[standard part function|standard part]]'' of a finite hyperreal {{mvar|r}}. The standard part of {{mvar|r}}, denoted {{math|st(''r'')}}, is a standard real number infinitely close to {{mvar|r}}. One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together. Keisler's book is now out of print, but is freely available from his website; see references below.

==Critique==
{{summarize|from|criticism of non-standard analysis|section=y}}
Despite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of non-standard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by E. Bishop, A. Connes, and P. Halmos, as documented at [[criticism of non-standard analysis]].

==Logical framework==
Given any set {{mvar|S}}, the ''superstructure'' over a set {{mvar|S}} is the set {{math|''V''(''S'')}} defined by the conditions

:&lt;math&gt;V_0(S) = S, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n+1}(S) = V_{n}(S) \cup \wp (V_{n}(S)), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(S) = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N}} V_{n}(S).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the superstructure over {{mvar|S}} is obtained by starting from {{mvar|S}} and iterating the operation of adjoining the [[power set]] of {{mvar|S}} and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains [[isomorphic]] copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within {{math|''V''('''R''')}}.

The working view of nonstandard analysis is a set {{math|*'''R'''}} and a mapping {{math|* : ''V''('''R''') → ''V''(*'''R''')}} which satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.

A formula has ''bounded quantification'' if and only if the only quantifiers which occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \Phi(x, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \in A, \Phi(x, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) &lt;/math&gt;

For example, the formula

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \ \exists y \in 2^B, \quad x \in y &lt;/math&gt;

has bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable {{mvar|x}} ranges over {{mvar|A}}, the existentially quantified variable {{mvar|y}} ranges over the powerset of {{mvar|B}}. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \ \exists y, \quad x \in y &lt;/math&gt;

does not have bounded quantification because the quantification of ''y'' is unrestricted.

==Internal sets==
A set ''x'' is ''internal'' if and only if ''x'' is an element of *''A'' for some element ''A'' of {{math|''V''('''R''')}}. *''A'' itself is internal if ''A'' belongs to {{math|''V''('''R''')}}.

We now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:
* [[Extension principle]]: The mapping * is the identity on {{math|'''R'''}}.
* ''Transfer principle'': For any formula {{math|''P''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} with bounded quantification and with free variables {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and for any elements {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|''V''('''R''')}}, the following equivalence holds:

::&lt;math&gt;P(A_1, \ldots, A_n) \iff P(*A_1, \ldots, *A_n) &lt;/math&gt;

* ''Countable saturation'': If {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''k'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; is a decreasing sequence of nonempty internal sets, with ''k'' ranging over the natural numbers, then

::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_k A_k \neq \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;

One can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of {{math|''V''('''R''')}} are called ''standard''. Elements of {{math|*'''R'''}} are called [[hyperreal number]]s.

==First consequences==
The symbol {{math|*'''N'''}} denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of {{math|'''N'''}}. The set {{math|*'''N''' − '''N'''}} is nonempty. To see this, apply countable [[saturated model|saturation]] to the sequence of internal sets

:&lt;math&gt; A_n = \{k \in {^*\mathbf{N}}: k \geq n\} &lt;/math&gt;

The sequence {{math|{''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.

We begin with some definitions: Hyperreals ''r'', ''s'' are ''infinitely close'' [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt; r \cong s \iff \forall \theta \in \mathbf{R}^+, \ |r - s| \leq \theta&lt;/math&gt;

A hyperreal {{mvar|r}} is ''infinitesimal'' if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if {{mvar|n}} is a [[hyperinteger]], i.e. an element of {{math|*'''N''' − '''N'''}}, then {{math|1/''n''}} is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal {{mvar|r}} is ''limited'' (or ''finite'') if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of {{math|*'''R'''}} containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].

The set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are ''external'' subsets of {{math|''V''(*'''R''')}}; what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.

'''Example''': The plane {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} with {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} ranging over {{math|*'''R'''}} is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} restricted to limited values (analogous to the [[Dehn planes|Dehn plane]]) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point {{math|(0, 1)}} on the {{mvar|y}}-axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis.

'''Theorem.''' For any limited hyperreal {{mvar|r}} there is a unique standard real denoted {{math|st(''r'')}} infinitely close to {{mvar|r}}. The mapping {{math|st}} is a ring homomorphism from the ring of limited hyperreals to {{math|'''R'''}}.

The mapping st is also external.

One way of thinking of the [[standard part function|standard part]] of a hyperreal, is in terms of [[Dedekind cut]]s; any limited hyperreal {{mvar|s}} defines a cut by considering the pair of sets {{math|(''L'', ''U'')}} where {{mvar|L}} is the set of standard rationals {{mvar|a}} less than {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|U}} is the set of standard rationals {{mvar|b}} greater than {{mvar|s}}. The real number corresponding to {{math|(''L'', ''U'')}} can be seen to satisfy the condition of being the standard part of {{mvar|s}}.

One intuitive characterization of continuity is as follows:

'''Theorem.''' A real-valued function {{mvar|f}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is continuous if and only if for every hyperreal {{mvar|x}} in the interval {{math|*[''a'', ''b'']}}, we have: {{math|*''f''(''x'') ≅ *''f''(st(''x''))}}.

(see [[microcontinuity]] for more details). Similarly,

'''Theorem.''' A real-valued function {{mvar|f}} is differentiable at the real value {{mvar|x}} if and only if for every infinitesimal hyperreal number {{mvar|h}}, the value

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x)= \operatorname{st} \left(\frac{{^*f}(x+h) - {^*f}(x)}{h}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

exists and is independent of {{mvar|h}}. In this case {{math|''f''′(''x'')}} is a real number and is the derivative of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}.

=={{mvar|κ}}-saturation==
It is possible to "improve" the saturation by allowing collections of higher cardinality to be intersected. A model is {{mvar|κ}}-[[Saturated model|saturated]] if whenever &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of internal sets with the [[finite intersection property]] and &lt;math&gt;|I|\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful, for instance, in a topological space {{mvar|X}}, where we may want {{math|{{!}}2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}}}-saturation to ensure the intersection of a standard [[neighborhood base]] is nonempty.&lt;ref&gt;Salbany, S.; Todorov, T. [http://www.esi.ac.at/static/esiprpr/esi666.pdf Nonstandard Analysis in Point-Set Topology]. Erwing Schrodinger Institute for Mathematical Physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

For any cardinal {{mvar|κ}}, a {{mvar|κ}}-saturated extension can be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. C.; Keisler, H. J. Model theory. Third edition.

OneLogin remained available and performant during the October 2016 attack on Dyn, a major provider of DNS services, which brought down many websites, including Spotify, Twitter, Reddit, and The New York Times, in part by using redundant DNS providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/how-onelogin-maintained-100-percent-uptime-during-the-dyn-ddos-attack|title=(Press Release) How OneLogin maintained 100% uptime during the Dyn DDoS attack|last=|first=|date=|website=OneLogin|publisher=OneLogin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==

OneLogin regularly performs penetration tests and network scans, anti-phishing programs, and runs a bug bounty program and vulnerability disclosure program.&lt;ref name="OLCompliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/compliance/|title=(Press Release) OneLogin Compliance Initiatives|last=|first=|date=|website=OneLogin|publisher=OneLogin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OneLogin Security Breach, August 2016''

In August 2016, OneLogin reported that "an unauthorised user gained access to one of our standalone systems, which we use for log storage and analytics.". The single user accessed the service for a month or more, and may have been able to see Secure Notes unencrypted. To remediate, OneLogin fixed the cleartext logging bug, locked down access to the log management system, and reset passwords.&lt;ref name="OLBreach1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/august-2016-incident|title=(Press Release) August 2016 Incident|last=|first=|date=|website=OneLogin|publisher=OneLogin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OneLogin Security Breach, May 2017''

On May 31, 2017, OneLogin detected and stopped unauthorized access in their US data region. According to a OneLogin blog post on the breach, "a threat actor used one of our AWS keys to gain access to our AWS platform via an API from an intermediate host with another, smaller service provider in the US."&lt;ref name="Breach2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/may-31-2017-security-incident|title=(Press Release) May 31, 2017 Security Incident|last=|first=|date=|website=OneLogin|publisher=OneLogin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OneLogin staff detected the intrusion in seven hours. This seven hour Time to Detection (TTD) was faster than Cisco's estimated industry average of 100–200 days to detect a breach and FireEye's 146 days to detect a breach, and slightly faster than Cisco's best median TTD of nine hours to discover security issues.&lt;ref name="Kenna17"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Rise in Non-Targeted Attacks Has Widened the Remediation Gap|url=https://www.kennasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/Kenna-NonTargetedAttacksReport.pdf|website=Kenna|publisher=Kenna Security|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InfocyteFireEye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerritz|first1=Chris|title=Breach Detection by the Numbers: Days, Weeks or Years?|url=https://www.infocyte.com/blog/2016/7/26/how-many-days-does-it-take-to-discover-a-breach-the-answer-may-shock-you|website=Infocyte|publisher=Infocyte|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OneLogin staff shut down the affected instances as well as the compromised AWS keys within several minutes to stop the intrusion and confirmed there were no other active threats. This was significantly faster than the industry average of 100–120 days to remediate existing vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Kenna17" /&gt;

The company has since improved its monitoring of AWS API endpoint signals, strengthened AWS key management, enhanced infrastructure and application encryption, expanded threat hunting activities and created additional in-app risk mitigation tools.

'''Palingenesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|l|ɪ|n|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ə|s|ɪ|s}}; also '''palingenesia''') is a concept of [[reincarnation|rebirth or re-creation]], used in various contexts in [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[politics]], and [[biology]]. Its meaning stems from Greek ''palin'', meaning ''again'', and ''genesis'', meaning ''birth''.

In biology, it is another word for [[recapitulation theory|recapitulation]]—the largely discredited hypothesis which talks of the phase in the development of an organism in which its form and structure pass through the changes undergone in the evolution of the species. In political theory, it is a central component of [[Roger Griffin]]'s analysis of Fascism as a fundamentally modernist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, Modernism and Fascism (Basingstoke, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In theology, the word may refer to [[reincarnation]] or to Christian spiritual rebirth symbolized by baptism.

==Philosophy and theology==
The word ''palingenesis'' or rather ''palingenesia'' ({{lang-grc|παλιγγενεσία}}) may be traced back to the [[Stoicism|Stoic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/stoicorumveterum02arniuoft#page/190/mode/2up 2.627]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The concept is attributed to [[Chrysippus]] by [[Lactantius]] — see Harry Austryn Wolfson (1961), "Immortality and Resurrection in the Philosophy of the Church Fathers", in: Everett Ferguson (ed.), ''Doctrines of Human Nature, Sin, and Salvation in the Early Church'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', Cambridge University Press, 1978, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Albert Harrill, [https://www.academia.edu/1865923/Stoic_Physics_the_Universal_Conflagration_and_the_Eschatological_Destruction_of_the_Ignorant_and_Unstable_in_2_Peter "Stoic Physics, the Universal Conflagration, and the Eschatological Destruction of the “Ignorant and Unstable” in 2 Peter"], in: Tuomas Rasimus, Troels Engberg-Pedersen, Ismo Dunderberg (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lR2kxd17v44C&amp;dq= ''Stoicism in Early Christianity''], Baker Academic, 2010, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; who used the term for the continual re-[[creation myth|creation]] of the [[universe]]. Similarly [[Philo]] spoke of [[Noah]] and his sons as leaders of a renovation or rebirth of the earth, [[Plutarch]] of the [[transmigration of souls]], and [[Cicero]] of his own return from exile.

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|19:28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesus]] is quoted in Greek (although his historical utterance would most likely have been in [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]]) using the word "παλιγγενεσία" (''palingenesia'') to describe the [[Last Judgment]] foreshadowing the event of the regeneration of a new world. Palingenesia is thus as much the result of, or reason for, the Last Judgement as it is directly the Judgement itself.

In philosophy it denotes in its broadest sense the theory (e.g. of the [[Pythagoreans]]) that the human soul does not die with the body but is born again in new [[incarnation]]s. It is thus the equivalent of [[metempsychosis]]. The term has a narrower and more specific use in the system of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], who applied it to his doctrine that the will does not die but manifests itself afresh in new individuals. He thus repudiates the primitive metempsychosis doctrine which maintains the [[reincarnation]] of the particular soul.

[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1628), writes, "The Pythagoreans defend metempsychosis and palingenesia, that souls go from one body to another."

The 17th century English physician-philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643) declared a belief in palingenesis, stating,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A plant or vegetable consumed to ashes, to a contemplative and school Philosopher seems utterly destroyed, and the form to have taken his leave for ever: But to a sensible Artist the forms are not perished, but withdrawn into their incombustible part, where they lie secure from the action of that devouring element. This is made good by experience, which can from the ashes of a plant revive the plant, and from its cinders recall it into its stalk and leaves again.'&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne, ''The Major Works'', ed. C. A. Patrides, Penguin, 1977, R.M.1:48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Palingenesis is the subject of the Argentine author [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s last ever short story, ''The Rose of Paracelsus'' (1983)

==Politics and history==
In [[Antiquities of the Jews]] (11.3.9) [[Josephus]] used the term ''palingenesis'' for the national restoration of the [[Jew]]s in their homeland after the [[Babylonian exile]]. The term is commonly used in [[Modern Greek]] to refer to the rebirth of the Greek nation after the [[Greek Revolution]]. British political theorist [[Roger Griffin]] has coined the term ''[[palingenetic ultranationalism]]'' as a core tenet of [[fascism]], stressing the notion of fascism as an ideology of rebirth of a [[sovereign state|state]] or [[empire]] in the image of that which came before it – its ancestral political underpinnings. Examples of this are [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascism .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Under [[Benito Mussolini]], Italy purported to establish an empire as the second incarnation of the [[Roman Empire]], while [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime was seen{{By whom|date=December 2015}} as being the third palingenetic incarnation of the German "Reich" - beginning first with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ("First Reich"), followed by Bismarck's [[German Empire]] ("Second Reich") and then Nazi Germany ("Third Reich").

Moreover, Griffin's work on palingenesis in fascism analysed the pre-war [[Fin de siècle|Fin De Siecle]] Western society. In doing so he built on Frank Kermode's work ''The Sense of an Ending'' which sought to understand the belief in the death of society at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kermode, ''The Sense of an Ending: Studies in Theory and Fiction'' (Oxford, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this death and rebirth Fascism sought to target what it perceived as degenerative elements of society, notably decadence, materialism, rationalism and enlightenment ideology. Out of this death society would regenerate by returning to a more spiritual and emotional state, with the role of the individual core. This built on the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Gustave Le Bon]] and [[Henri Bergson]]'s work on the relationship between the mass and the individual with the individual's actions necessary to achieving a state of regeneration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] expressed his [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat|post-coup]] [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|project in government]] as a national rebirth inspired in [[Diego Portales]], a figure of the early republic:&lt;ref&gt;[http://beersandpolitics.com/discursos/augusto-pinochet/a-un-mes-de-la-constitucion-de-la-junta-de-gobierno/1000 Pinochet's discourse of 11 October 1973].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|...[democracy] will be born again purified from the vices and bad habits that ended up destroying our institutions... ...we are inspired in the [[Diego Portales|Portalian spirit]] which has fused together the nation...|author=Augusto Pinochet, 11 October 1973.}}

==Science==
In modern biology (e.g. [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] and [[Fritz Müller]]), ''palingenesis'' has been used for the exact reproduction of ancestral features by inheritance, as opposed to [[kenogenesis]], in which the inherited characteristics are modified by environment.

It was also applied to the quite different process supposed by [[Karl Beurlen]] to be the mechanism for his [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levit, Georgy S |author2=Olsson, Lennart |date=2007 |title=Evolution on Rails Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis |editor=Wisseman, Volker |work=Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11/2006 |pages=115–119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJso832AGXEC&amp;pg=PA118 |publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen |isbn=978-3-938616-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24421">[[Image:TooManyPigeons.jpg|thumb|right|Pigeons in holes. Here there are {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 10}} pigeons in {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 9}} holes. Since 10 is greater than 9, the pigeonhole principle says that at least one hole has more than one pigeon.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''pigeonhole principle''' states that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items are put into &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; containers, with &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;, then at least one container must contain more than one item.&lt;ref name=Herstein64&gt;{{harvnb|Herstein|1964|loc= p.&amp;nbsp;90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theorem is exemplified in real life by truisms like "in any group of three gloves there must be at least two left gloves or at least two right gloves". It is an example of a [[combinatorics|counting argument]]. This seemingly obvious statement can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results; for example, that there are two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.

The first formalization of the idea is believed to have been made by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] in 1834 under the name ''Schubfachprinzip'' ("drawer principle" or "shelf principle").  For this reason it is also commonly called '''Dirichlet's box principle''' or '''Dirichlet's drawer principle'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Miller, Peter Flor, Gunnar Berg, and Julio González Cabillón. "[http://jeff560.tripod.com/p.html Pigeonhole principle]". In Jeff Miller (ed.) ''[http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics]''. Electronic document, retrieved November 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with '''Dirichlet's principle''', a term introduced by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] that refers to the minimum principle for [[harmonic function]]s.  

The principle has several generalizations and can be stated in various ways. In a more quantified version: for [[natural number]]s &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;n = km + 1&lt;/math&gt; objects are distributed among &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1987|loc=p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For arbitrary &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; this generalizes to &lt;math&gt;k + 1 = \lfloor(n - 1)/m \rfloor + 1 = \lceil n/m\rceil,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor\cdots\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lceil\cdots\rceil&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[floor function|floor]] and [[ceiling function]]s, respectively.

Though the most straightforward application is to [[finite set]]s (such as pigeons and boxes), it is also used with [[infinite set]]s that cannot be put into [[one-to-one correspondence]].  To do so requires the formal statement of the pigeonhole principle, which is ''"there does not exist an [[injective function]] whose [[codomain]] is smaller than its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]"''.  Advanced mathematical proofs like [[Siegel's lemma]] build upon this more general concept.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Pigeon-hole messagebox 3.jpg|thumb|Pigeon-hole messageboxes at [[Stanford University]], nearer to "Schubfach" than the more picturesque dovecotes]]

Dirichlet published his works in both French and German, using either the German ''[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GS18102#XGS18102 Schubfach]'' (he wrote about distributing pearls), or the French ''[[wikt:tiroir|tiroir]]''. The strict original meaning of both corresponds to the English ''[[wikt:drawer|drawer]]'', an ''open-topped box that can be slid in and out of the cabinet that contains it''. These terms were morphed to the word ''[[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonhole]]'', standing for a ''small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers'', metaphorically rooted in the structures that house pigeons.

Since Dirichlet's father was a postmaster, and furniture with pigeonholes is commonly used for storing or sorting things into many categories (like letters in a post office or room keys in a hotel), the translation ''pigeonhole'' may be a perfect rendering of Dirichlet's metaphor. That understanding of the word, referring to some furniture features, is fading —especially among those who do not speak English natively but as a [[lingua franca]] in the scientific world— in favour of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. The suggestive, though not misleading interpretation of "pigeonhole" as "dovecote" has lately found its way back to a German "re-translation" of the "pigeonhole"-principle as the "Taubenschlag"-principle.&lt;ref&gt;Diskrete Mathematik - Page 367
https://books.google.at/books?isbn=3833455292&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the original terms "Schubfach-Prinzip" in German&lt;ref&gt;The Induction Book - Page 13
https://books.google.at/books?isbn=0486811999&lt;/ref&gt; and "Principe de tiroirs" in French&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics Dictionary - Page 490
https://books.google.at/books?isbn=0412990415&lt;/ref&gt;, other literal translations are still in use in [[Polish language|Polish]] ("zasada szufladkowa"), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ("принцип на чекмеджетата"), [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ("çekmece ilkesi"), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ("skatulyaelv"), [[Italian language|Italian]] ("principio dei cassetti"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ("ladenprincipe "), [[Danish language|Danish]] ("Skuffeprincippet"), [[Persian language|Persian]] ("اصل لانه کبوتری"), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ("抽屉原理"), and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ("引き出し論法").

== Examples ==

=== Sock-picking ===
Assume a drawer contains a mixture of black socks and blue socks, each of which can be worn on either foot, and that you are pulling a number of socks from the drawer without looking. What is the minimum number of pulled socks required to guarantee a pair of the same color? Using the pigeonhole principle, to have at least one pair of the same color {{math|(''m'' {{=}} 2}} holes, one per color) using one pigeonhole per color, you need to pull only three socks from the drawer {{math|(''n'' {{=}} 3}} items). Either you have ''three'' of one color, or you have ''two'' of one color and ''one'' of the other.

=== Hand-shaking ===
If there are {{math|''n''}} people who can shake hands with one another (where {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}), the pigeonhole principle shows that there is always a pair of people who will shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of hands shaken by that person. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}}, there are {{math|''n''}} possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the {{math|'''n'' &amp;minus; 1'}} hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}!) for some person to shake hands with everybody else while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves {{math|''n''}} people to be placed into at most {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.

=== Hair-counting ===
We can demonstrate there must be at least two people in [[London]] with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows.&lt;ref&gt;To avoid a slightly messier presentation we assume that "people" in this example only refers to people who are not bald.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a typical human head has an [[average]] of around 150,000 hairs, it is reasonable to assume (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head {{math|(''m'' {{=}} 1 million}} holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ({{math|''n''}} is bigger than 1&amp;nbsp;million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there must be at least two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}). For the average case ({{math|1=''m'' = 150,000}}) with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the "collision" happens before we get to the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing of the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of [[probability distribution]]).

There is a passing, satirical, allusion in English to this version of the principle in ''A History of the Athenian Society'', prefixed to ""A Supplement to the Athenian Oracle: Being a Collection of the
Remaining Questions and Answers in the Old Athenian Mercuries"", (Printed for Andrew Bell, London, 1710).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=JCwUAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=mean+hairs&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the question ''whether there were any two persons in the World that have an equal number of hairs on their head?'' had been raised in ''The Athenian Mercury'' before 1704.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=4QsUAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=sent+quarters&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=GG0PAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=town+eternity&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first written reference to the pigeonhole principle appears in 1622 in a short sentence of the Latin work ''Selectæ Propositiones'', by the French Jesuit Jean Leurechon,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Benoit|last1=Rittaud|first2=Albrecht|last2=Heeffer|title=The Pigeonhole Principle, Two Centuries before Dirichlet|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=36|year=2014|issue=2|pages=27–29|doi=10.1007/s00283-013-9389-1|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4115264/file/4115265.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote "It is necessary that two men have the same number of hairs, écus, or other things, as each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jean|last=Leurechon|title=Selecæe Propositiones in Tota Sparsim Mathematica Pulcherrimæ|year=1622|publisher=Gasparem Bernardum|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The birthday problem ===
The [[birthday problem]] asks, for a set of {{math|''n''}} randomly chosen people, what is the probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday? By the pigeonhole principle, if there are 367 people in the room, we know that there is at least one pair who share the same birthday, as there are only 366 possible birthdays to choose from (including February 29, if present). 
The birthday "paradox" refers to the result that even if the group is as small as 23 individuals, the probability that there is a pair of people with the same birthday is still above 50%. While at first glance this may seem surprising, it intuitively makes sense when considering that a comparison will actually be made between every possible pair of people rather than fixing one individual and comparing them solely to the rest of the group.

=== Team tournament ===
Imagine seven people who want to play in a tournament of teams {{math|(''n'' {{=}} 7}} items), with a limitation of only four teams {{math|(''m'' {{=}} 4}} holes) to choose from. The pigeonhole principle tells us that they cannot all play for different teams; there must be at least one team featuring at least two of the seven players: 
: &lt;math&gt; \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{7-1}{4} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac64 \right\rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 &lt;/math&gt;

===Subset sum===
Any subset of size six from the set {{math|''S''}} = {1,2,3,...,9} must contain two elements whose sum is 10. The pigeonholes will be labelled by the two element subsets {1,9}, {2,8}, {3,7}, {4,6} and the singleton {5}, five pigeonholes in all. When the six "pigeons" (elements of the size six subset) are placed into these pigeonholes, each pigeon going into the pigeonhole that has it contained in its label, at least one of the pigeonholes labelled with a two element subset will have two pigeons in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|1994|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses and applications ==
The principle can be used to prove that any [[lossless compression]] algorithm, provided it makes some inputs smaller (as the name compression suggests), will also make some other inputs larger. Otherwise, the set of all input sequences up to a given length {{math|''L''}} could be mapped to the (much) smaller set of all sequences of length less than {{math|''L''}} without collisions (because the compression is lossless), a possibility which the pigeonhole principle excludes.

A notable problem in [[mathematical analysis]] is, for a fixed [[irrational number]] {{math|''a''}}, to show that the set {[{{math|''na'']: ''n''}} is an integer} of [[fractional part]]s is [[Dense-in-itself|dense]] in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. One finds that it is not easy to explicitly find integers {{math|''n'', ''m''}} such that {{math|{{!}}''na'' &amp;minus; ''ma''{{!}} &lt; ''e''}}, where {{math|''e'' &gt; 0}} is a small positive number and {{math|''a''}} is some arbitrary irrational number. But if one takes {{math|''M''}} such that {{math|1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}, by the pigeonhole principle there must be {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; {1, 2, ..., ''M'' + 1}}} such that {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} are in the same integer subdivision of size {{math|1/''M''}} (there are only {{math|''M''}} such subdivisions between consecutive integers). In particular, we can find {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} is in {{math|(''p'' + ''k''/''M'', ''p'' + (''k'' + 1)/''M'')}}, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} is in {{math|(''q'' + ''k''/''M'', ''q'' + (''k'' + 1)/''M'')}}, for some {{math|''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q''}} integers and {{math|''k''}} in {{math|{0, 1, ..., ''M'' &amp;minus; 1}}}. We can then easily verify that {{math|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''a''}} is in {{math|(''q'' &amp;minus; ''p'' &amp;minus; 1/''M'', ''q'' &amp;minus; ''p'' + 1/''M'')}}. This implies that {{math|[''na''] &lt; 1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}, where {{math|1=''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|1=''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This shows that 0 is a limit point of {[{{math|''na''}}]}. We can then use this fact to prove the case for {{math|''p''}} in {{math|(0, 1]}}: find {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|[''na''] &lt; 1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}; then if {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; (0, 1/''M''}}], we are done. Otherwise {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; (''j''/''M'', (''j'' + 1)/''M''}}], and by setting {{math|1=''k'' = sup{''r'' &amp;isin; ''N'' : ''r''[''na''] &lt; ''j''/''M''}}}, one obtains {{math|{{!}}[(''k'' + 1)''na''] &amp;minus; ''p''{{!}} &lt; 1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}.

Variants occurring in well known proofs:
In the proof of the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]], a version that mixes finite and infinite sets is used: If infinitely many objects are placed into finitely many boxes, then there exist two objects that share a box.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata'', Peter Linz, pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116, Jones and Bartlett Learning, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
In Fisk's solution of the [[Art gallery problem]] a sort of converse is used: If ''n'' objects are placed into ''k'' boxes, then there is a box containing at most ''n''/''k'' objects.&lt;ref&gt;''Computational Geometry in C'',  Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, 2nd Edition, Joseph O'Rourke, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate formulations ==
The following are alternate formulations of the pigeonhole principle.

#If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''m''}} places, and if {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}, then some place receives at least two objects.&lt;ref name=Herstein64 /&gt;
#(equivalent formulation of 1)  If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''n''}} places in such a way that no place receives more than one object, then each place receives exactly one object.&lt;ref name=Herstein64 /&gt;
#If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''m''}} places, and if {{math|''n'' &lt; ''m''}}, then some place receives no object.
#(equivalent formulation of 3)  If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''n''}} places in such a way that no place receives no object, then each place receives exactly one object.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong form==
Let {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be positive integers. If
:&lt;math&gt;q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_n - n + 1&lt;/math&gt;
objects are distributed into {{math|''n''}} boxes, then either the first box contains at least {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} objects, or the second box contains at least {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} objects, ..., or the {{math|''n''}}th box contains at least {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|page=74 Theorem 3.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple form is obtained from this by taking {{math|1=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2}}, which gives {{math|''n'' + 1}} objects. Taking {{math|1=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}} gives the more quantified version of the principle, namely:

Let {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''r''}} be positive integers. If {{math|''n''(''r'' - 1) + 1}} objects are distributed into {{math|''n''}} boxes, then at least one of the boxes contains {{math|''r''}} or more of the objects.&lt;ref&gt;In the lead section this was presented with the substitutions {{math|1=''m'' = ''n''}} and {{math|1=''k'' = ''r'' − 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This can also be stated as, if {{math|''k''}} discrete objects are to be allocated to {{math|''n''}} containers, then at least one container must hold at least &lt;math&gt;\lceil k/n \rceil&lt;/math&gt; objects, where &lt;math&gt;\lceil x\rceil&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ceiling function]], denoting the smallest integer larger than or equal to {{math|''x''}}. 
Similarly, at least one container must hold no more than &lt;math&gt;\lfloor k/n \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; objects, where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]], denoting the largest integer smaller than or equal to {{math|''x''}}.

== Generalizations of the pigeonhole principle ==

A probabilistic generalization of the pigeonhole principle states that if {{math|''n''}} pigeons are randomly put into {{math|''m''}} pigeonholes with uniform probability {{math|1/''m''}}, then at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon with probability

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{(m)_n}{m^n}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|(''m'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[falling factorial]] {{math|''m''(''m'' &amp;minus; 1)(''m'' &amp;minus; 2)...(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'' + 1)}}. For {{math|1=''n'' = 0}} and for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} (and {{math|''m'' &gt; 0}}), that probability is zero; in other words, if there is just one pigeon, there cannot be a conflict. For {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m''}} (more pigeons than pigeonholes) it is one, in which case it coincides with the ordinary pigeonhole principle. But even if the number of pigeons does not exceed the number of pigeonholes ({{math|''n'' ≤ ''m''}}), due to the random nature of the assignment of pigeons to pigeonholes there is often a substantial chance that clashes will occur. For example, if 2 pigeons are randomly assigned to 4 pigeonholes, there is a 25% chance that at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon; for 5 pigeons and 10 holes, that probability is 69.76%; and for 10 pigeons and 20 holes it is about 93.45%. If the number of holes stays fixed, there is always a greater probability of a pair when you add more pigeons. This problem is treated at much greater length in the [[birthday paradox]].

A further probabilistic generalization is that when a real-valued [[random variable]] {{math|''X''}} has a finite [[mean]] {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, then the probability is nonzero that {{math|''X''}} is greater than or equal to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, and similarly the probability is nonzero that {{math|''X''}} is less than or equal to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. To see that this implies the standard pigeonhole principle, take any fixed arrangement of {{math|''n''}} pigeons into {{math|''m''}} holes and let {{math|''X''}} be the number of pigeons in a hole chosen uniformly at random. The mean of {{math|''X''}} is {{math|''n''/''m''}}, so if there are more pigeons than holes the mean is greater than one. Therefore, {{math|''X''}} is sometimes at least 2.

== Infinite sets ==
The pigeonhole principle can be extended to [[infinite set]]s by phrasing it in terms of [[cardinal number]]s: if the cardinality of set {{mvar|A}} is greater than the cardinality of set {{mvar|B}}, then there is no injection from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}}. However, in this form the principle is [[tautology (logic)|tautological]], since the meaning of the statement that the cardinality of set {{mvar|A}} is greater than the cardinality of set {{mvar|B}} is exactly that there is no injective map from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}}. However, adding at least one element to a finite set is sufficient to ensure that the cardinality increases.

Another way to phrase the pigeonhole principle for finite sets is similar to the principle that finite sets are [[Dedekind finite]]: Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be finite sets. If there is a surjection from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} that is not injective, then no surjection from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} is injective. In fact no function of any kind from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} is injective. This is not true for infinite sets: Consider the function on the natural numbers that sends 1 and 2 to 1, 3 and 4 to 2, 5 and 6 to 3, and so on.

There is a similar principle for infinite sets: If uncountably many pigeons are stuffed into countably many pigeonholes, there will exist at least one pigeonhole having uncountably many pigeons stuffed into it.

This principle is not a generalization of the pigeonhole principle for finite sets however: It is in general false for finite sets. In technical terms it says that if {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are finite sets such that any surjective function from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} is not injective, then there exists an element of {{mvar|b}} of {{mvar|B}} such that there exists a bijection between the preimage of {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|A}}. This is a quite different statement, and is absurd for large finite cardinalities.

The '''principle of explosion''' (Latin: ''ex falso (sequitur) quodlibet'' (EFQ), "from falsehood, anything (follows)", or ''ex contradictione (sequitur) quodlibet'' (ECQ), "from contradiction, anything (follows)"), or the '''principle of [[Pseudo-Scotus]]''', is the law of [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]] and similar logical systems, according to which any statement can be proven from a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Carnielli, W. and Marcos, J. (2001) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.107.70 "Ex contradictione non sequitur quodlibet"] ''Proc. 2nd Conf. on Reasoning and Logic'' (Bucharest, July 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, once a contradiction has been asserted, any proposition (including their negations) can be inferred from it. This is known as '''deductive explosion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|at=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The proof of this principle was first given by 12th century French philosopher [[William of Soissons]].&lt;ref&gt; Graham Priest, 'What's so bad about contradictions?' in Priest, Beal and Armour-Garb, ''The law of non-contradicton'', p. 25, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

As a demonstration of the principle, consider two contradictory statements – "All lemons are yellow" and "Not all lemons are yellow", and suppose (for the sake of argument) that both are simultaneously true.  If that is the case, anything can be proven, e.g. "unicorns exist", by using the following argument:
# We know that "All lemons are yellow" as it is defined to be true.
# Therefore, the statement that ("All lemons are yellow" OR "unicorns exist”) must also be true, since the first part is true.
# However, if "Not all lemons are yellow" (and this is also defined to be true), unicorns must exist – otherwise statement 2 would be false (in rigor, given that at least one lemon exists).  It has thus been "proven" that unicorns exist. The same could be applied to any assertion, including the statement "unicorns do not exist".

Due to the principle of explosion, the existence of a contradiction ([[inconsistency]]) in a [[formal system|formal axiomatic system]] is disastrous; since any statement can be proved true it trivializes the concepts of truth and falsity.&lt;ref name="McKubre-Jordens"&gt;{{cite web

Mathematicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Ernst Zermelo]], [[Abraham Fraenkel]], and [[Thoralf Skolem]] put much effort into revising [[set theory]] to eliminate these contradictions, resulting in the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].    

In a different solution to these problems, a few mathematicians have devised alternate theories of [[logic (mathematics)|logic]] called [[paraconsistent logic]]s, which eliminate the principle of explosion.&lt;ref name="McKubre-Jordens" /&gt;  These allow some contradictory statements to be proved without affecting other proofs.

==Symbolic representation==
In [[symbolic logic]], the principle of explosion can be expressed in the following way
:&lt;math&gt;\forall P \forall Q: (P \land \lnot P) \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;
(For any statements ''P'' and ''Q'', if ''P'' and not-''P'' are both true, then ''Q'' is true)

==Proof==
Below is a formal proof of the principle using [[symbolic logic]]
#&lt;math&gt;P \wedge \neg P&lt;/math&gt;
#:assumption
#&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (1) by [[conjunction elimination]]
#&lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (1) by conjunction elimination
#&lt;math&gt;P \vee Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (2) by [[disjunction introduction]]
#&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (3) and (4) by [[disjunctive syllogism]]
#&lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \neg P) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (5) by [[conditional proof]] (discharging assumption 1)

This is just the symbolic version of the informal argument given in the introduction, with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; standing for "all lemons are yellow" and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; standing for "Unicorns exist". From "all lemons are yellow and not all lemons are yellow" (1), we infer "all lemons are yellow" (2) and "not all lemons are yellow" (3); from "all lemons are yellow" (2), we infer "all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist" (4); and from "not all lemons are yellow" (3) and "all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist" (4), we infer "unicorns exist" (5). Hence, if all lemons are yellow and not all lemons are yellow, then unicorns exist.

===Semantic argument===
An alternate argument for the principle stems from [[model theory]].  A sentence &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[semantic consequence]]'' of a set of sentences &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; only if every model of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  But there is no model of the contradictory set &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;.  [[A fortiori]], there is no model of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt; that is not a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, vacuously, every model of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.   Thus &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a semantic consequence of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Paraconsistent logic==

[[Paraconsistent logic]]s have been developed that allow for sub-contrary forming operators.   [[Formal semantics (logic)|Model-theoretic]] paraconsistent logicians often deny the assumption that there can be no model of &lt;math&gt;\{\phi , \lnot \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; and devise semantical systems in which there are such models. Alternatively, they reject the idea that propositions can be classified as true or false.  [[Proof-theoretic semantics|Proof-theoretic]] paraconsistent logics usually deny the validity of one of the steps necessary for deriving an explosion, typically including disjunctive syllogism, disjunction introduction, and [[reductio ad absurdum]].

==Use==
The [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] value of the principle of explosion is that for any logical system where this principle holds, any derived [[mathematical theory|theory]] which proves [[false (logic)|⊥]] (or an equivalent form, &lt;math&gt;\phi \land \lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt;) is worthless because ''all'' its [[statement (logic)|statements]] would become [[theorem]]s, making it impossible to distinguish [[truth]] from falsehood. That is to say, the principle of explosion is an argument for the [[law of non-contradiction]] in classical logic, because without it all truth statements become meaningless.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">The term '''reparation''' was used by [[Melanie Klein]] (1921) to indicate a psychological process of making mental repairs to a damaged internal world.&lt;ref&gt;Lani A. Gerity, ''Creativity and the Dissociated Patient'' (1999) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In [[object relations theory]], it represents a key part of the movement from the [[paranoid-schizoid position]] to the [[depressive position]] — the pain of the latter helping to fuel the urge to reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Caper, ''Immaterial Facts'' (2000) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klein==
{{Main|Melanie Klein|Splitting (psychology)#Melanie Klein|l2=Klein's theory splitting}}
Klein considered the ability to recognise our destructive impulses towards those we love, and to make reparation for the damage we have caused them, to be an essential part of mental health. A key condition for this to take place is the recognition of one's separateness from one's parents,&lt;ref name = Segal89&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; which makes possible the reparative attempt to restore their inner representations, however damaged these may be felt to be.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of reality, inner and outer, forms a major part of this process; it involves both an abandonment of fantasies of [[omnipotence]],&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., ''Winnicott and the Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (London 2007) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and accepting the independent existence of one's objects of attachment.&lt;ref name = Segal89/&gt;

Where the damage done to the internal world is felt by a patient to be extreme, however, the task of reparation may seem too great — which is one of the obstacles facing the analytic attempt at cure.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manic reparation==

Kleinian thought distinguishes between true reparation and manic reparation, the latter being driven by guilt rather than overcoming it.&lt;ref&gt;Hyam Sydney Klein/Joan Symington, ''Imprisoned Pain and its Transformation'' (London 2000) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Manic reparation denies the pain and concern of feeling guilty by using magical methods of repair&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 84-5 and p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; which maintain omnipotent control of the object in question, and refuse to allow it its separate existence. Thus manic reparation has to be endlessly repeated, since success would free the object from the manic person's (contemptuous) power.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winnicott==
{{Main|Donald Winnicott}}
Donald Winnicott made his own distinctive contribution to the role of reparation in the "personalising" of the individual, the move from the ruthless use of the external object to a sense of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 34-5&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott focused on the way at a certain stage of development a feeling of guilt or concern begins to appear after the wholehearted instinctual experience of a feed. But once the reparative gesture—a smile, a gift—has been successfully acknowledged by the mother, Winnicott writes: "The breast (body, mother) is now mended and the day's work is done. Tomorrow's instincts can be awaited with limited fear".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 17 and p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The child's contribution is a way of accepting the debt owed to the mother, for their survival and their participation in the work of reparation.&lt;ref name = Gaitanidis83/&gt; If, on the other hand, the reparative gesture is not accepted, the infant is left with a feeling of depression or meaninglessness.&lt;ref name = Gaitanidis83&gt;A. Gaitanidis/P. Curk, ''Narcissism: A Critical Reader'' (London 2007) p. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar dynamic may later appear between patient and analyst, with the making of progress being offered as a means of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;I. Salzberger-Wittenberg, ''Psychoanalytic Insight and Relationships'' (1984) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Kleinians considered that artistic creation was driven by the phantasy of repairing the loved object (mother).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/glover/index.html Nicola Glover "Psychoanalytic Aesthetics: The British School"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Marion Milner]] in the [[Middle Group|Independent]] tradition also saw art as a way of both symbolizing and enacting inner reparation;&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., ''Winnicott and the Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (London 2007) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; but was criticised by Kleinians for giving too large a role to the omnipotent feelings of the artist in reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Hinshelwood, Chapter 3 n54, in [http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/glover/index.html Glover]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual harassment''' is [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature and the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paludi | first1 = Michele A. | last2 = Barickman | first2 = Richard B. | chapter = Definitions and incidence of academic and workplace sexual harassment | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vx4qhVPOYUUC&amp;pg=PA2 | title = Academic and workplace sexual harassment: a resource manual  | pages = 2–5 | publisher = SUNY Press | location = Albany, New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780791408308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault|assault]].&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda. ''The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Chicago Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-8070-3100-1}}; Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A harasser may be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a client or customer. Harassers or victims may be of any [[gender]].&lt;ref name="eeoc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm | title = Sexual Harassment | publisher = U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that is due to the fact that they do not impose a "general civility code".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Oncale v.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.'', 528 U.S. 75 (1998) |findlaw=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/75.html |justia=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/75/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.

Sexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal [[employment discrimination]]. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology and history==
The modern legal understanding of sexual harassment was first developed in the 1970s, although related concepts have existed in many cultures.

=== The term "sexual harassment" ===
Although legal activist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] is sometimes credited with creating the laws surrounding sexual harassment in the United States with her 1979 book entitled ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women'',&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; the first known use of the term ''sexual harassment'' was in a 1973 report about discrimination called ''"Saturn's Rings"''  by [[Mary Rowe]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamberi|first=Ferdi|last2=Gollopeni|first2=Besim|date=2015-12-01|title=The Phenomenon of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace in Republic of Kosovo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316515762|journal=International Review of Social Sciences|volume=3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Rowe has stated that sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970s, and wasn't likely the first person to use the term. At the time, Rowe was the Chancellor for Women and Work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary, "Saturn's Rings," a study of the minutiae of sexism which maintain discrimination and inhibit affirmative action results in corporations and non-profit institutions; published in Graduate and Professional Education of Women, American Association of University Women, 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–9. "Saturn's Rings II" is a 1975 updating of the original, with racist and sexist incidents from 1974 and 1975. Revised and republished as "The Minutiae of Discrimination: The Need for Support," in Forisha, Barbara and Barbara Goldman, Outsiders on the Inside, Women in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey, 1981, Ch. 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–171. {{ISBN|978-0-13-645382-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her efforts at MIT, the university was one of the first large organizations in the U.S. to develop specific policies and procedures aimed at stopping sexual harassment.

In the book ''In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution'' (1999), journalist [[Susan Brownmiller]] quotes [[Cornell University]] activists who believed they had coined the term 'sexual harassment' in 1975 after being asked for help by [[Carmita Dickerson Wood]], a 44-year-old single mother who was being harassed by a faculty member at Cornell's Department of Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timeline.com/carmita-wood-sexual-harrassment-f2c537a0e1e8|title=Groping in the Ivy League led to the first sexual harassment suit—and nothing happened to the man|date=2017-10-20|work=Timeline|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuY_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=women+fight+intimidation+ithaca+journal#v=onepage&amp;q=carmita%20wood&amp;f=false|title=Cornell: A History, 1940–2015|last=Altschuler|first=Glenn C.|last2=Kramnick|first2=Isaac|date=2014-08-12|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801471889|location=|pages=146|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution |first=Susan |last=Brownmiller |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activists, [[Lin Farley]], [[Susan Meyer (Cornell University)|Susan Meyer]], and [[Karen Sauvigne]] went on to form the [[Working Women's Institute]] which, along with the [[Alliance Against Sexual Coercion]] (founded in 1976 by [[Freada Klein]], [[Lynn Wehrli]], and [[Elizabeth Cohn-Stuntz]]), were among the pioneer organizations to bring sexual harassment to public attention in the late 1970s. One of the first legal formulations of the concept of sexual harassment as consistent with sex discrimination and therefore prohibited behavior under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] appeared in the 1979 seminal book by Catharine MacKinnon&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=camtwo|title=MacKinnon, Catharine A. - University of Michigan Law School|website=www.law.umich.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "Sexual Harassment of Working Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacKinnon | first = Catharine |  title = Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination.  | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1979 | isbn = 9780300022995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key sexual harassment cases ===
Sexual harassment first became codified in U.S. law as the result of a series of sexual harassment cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the early women pursuing these cases were African American, often former civil rights activists who applied principles of civil rights to sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' (1976) and ''[[Paulette L. Barnes, Appellant, v. Douglas M. Costle, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (1977) determined it was sex discrimination to fire someone for refusing a supervisor's advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2wBPD1vvTCYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Diane+Williams%22+sexual+harassment#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Diane%20Williams%22&amp;f=false|title=The Women's Movement Against Sexual Harassment|last=Baker|first=Carrie N.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521879354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, ''[[Bundy v. Jackson]]'' was the first [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] case to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/04/hertoo-40-years-ago-this-woman-helped-make-sexual-harassment-illegal-sandra-bundy/|title=#HerToo: 40 Years Ago This Woman Helped Make Sexual Harassment Illegal|date=2018-03-04|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] agreed with this holding in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]].'' Another pioneering legal case was ''[[Alexander v. Yale]]'', which established that the sexual harassment of female students could be considered sex discrimination under [[Title IX]], and was thus illegal.

The term was largely unknown (outside academic and legal circles) until the early 1990s when [[Anita Hill]] witnessed and testified against [[Supreme Court of the United States]] nominee [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name="techrep"&gt;Bowers, Toni; Hook, Brian. [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/hostile-work-environment-a-managers-legal-liability/5035282 Hostile work environment: A manager's legal liability], Tech Republic. October 22, 2002. Retrieved on March 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hill testified in 1991, the number of sexual harassment cases reported in the US and Canada increased 58 percent and have climbed steadily.&lt;ref name="techrep" /&gt;

They can also be expecting to receive such power or authority in form of promotion. Forms of harassment relationships include:
* The perpetrator can be anyone, such as a client, a co-worker, a parent or legal guardian, relative, a teacher or professor, a student, a friend, or a stranger.
* The place of harassment occurrence may vary from different schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00415|title=Reporting of violence against women in University.

* There may or may not be other witnesses or attendances.
* The perpetrator may be completely unaware that his or her behavior is offensive or constitutes sexual harassment. The perpetrator may be completely unaware that his or her actions could be unlawful.&lt;ref name="eeoc"/&gt;
* The incident can take place in situations in which the harassed person may not be aware of or understand what is happening.
* The incident may be a one time occurrence but more often the incident repeats.
* Adverse effects on the target are common in the form of stress, social withdrawal, sleep, eating difficulties, and overall health impairment.
* The victim and perpetrator can be any gender.
* The perpetrator does not have to be of the opposite sex.
* The incident can result from a situation in which the perpetrator thinks they are making themselves clear, but is not understood the way they intended. The misunderstanding can either be reasonable or unreasonable. An example of unreasonable is when a woman holds a certain stereotypical view of a man such that she did not understand the man’s explicit message to stop.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Richard (1994).

With the advent of the internet, social interactions, including sexual harassment, increasingly occur online, for example [[sexual harassment in video gaming|in video games]] or in chat rooms.

The United States' [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) defines workplace sexual harassment as "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment” (EEOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/|title=EEOC Home Page|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varied behaviors==
[[File:Bullying Sexual.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A man makes an unwanted sexual advance on a woman.]]
One of the difficulties in understanding sexual harassment is that it involves a range of [[behavior]]s. In most cases (although not in all cases) it is difficult for the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[humiliation]] experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Louise|first=Fitzgerald|year=1995|title=Why Didn't She Just Report Him?

* A predatory harasser: a person who gets sexual thrills from humiliating others. This harasser may become involved in sexual extortion, and may frequently harass just to see how targets respond. Those who don't resist may even become targets for rape.
* A dominance harasser: the most common type, who engages in harassing behavior as an ego boost.
* Strategic or territorial harassers who seek to maintain privilege in jobs or physical locations, for example a man's harassment of a female employee in a predominantly male occupation.
* A [[Street harassment|street harasser]]: Another type of sexual harassment performed in public places by strangers. Street harassment includes verbal and nonverbal behavior, remarks that are frequently sexual in nature and comment on physical appearance or a person's presence in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women |first=Cynthia Grant |last=Bowman |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=3 |date=Jan 1993 |pages=517–80 |jstor=1341656 |doi=10.2307/1341656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sororities and fraternities in the United States take preventative measures against [[hazing]] and hazing activities during the participants' pledging processes (which may often include sexual harassment).

== Impact ==

The impact of sexual harassment can vary. In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence against women : an EU-wide survey : main results|others=European Union. Agency for Fundamental Rights.|isbn=9789292393427|location=Vienna|oclc=876847362|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Koss, Mary P. "Changed Lives: The Psychological Impact of Sexual Harassment." in ''Ivory Power: Sexual Harassment On Campus.''

(Her family was later awarded six million dollars in punitive and compensatory damages.)&lt;/ref&gt; Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.

As an overall social and economic effect every year, sexual harassment deprives women from active social and economic participation and costs hundreds of millions of dollars in lost educational and professional opportunities for mostly girls and women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quantity of men implied in these conflicts is significant.

Sexual harassment, by definition, is unwanted and not to be tolerated. There are ways, however, for offended and injured people to overcome the resultant psychological effects, remain in or return to society, regain healthy feelings within personal relationships when they were affected by the outside relationship trauma, regain social approval, and recover the ability to concentrate and be productive in educational and  work environments.

Immediate psychological and legal counseling are recommended since self-treatment may not release stress or remove trauma, and simply reporting to authorities may not have the desired effect, may be ignored, or may further injure the victim at its response.

A 1991 study done by K.R. Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the "lady", the "flirt", and the "tomboy".
The "ladies" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the "ladies" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "flirts" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments. Consequently, they became perceived as the "embodiment of the female stereotype,...as particularly lacking in potential and were given the fewest opportunities to develop job skills and to establish social and self-identities as miners."&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

The "tomboys" were generally single women, but were older than the "flirts". They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a "thick skin". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

The findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

===Common effects on the victims===
{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}
Common psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:
* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people "evaluate" the victim to establish if he or she is "worth" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)
* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip
* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions; increased [[absenteeism]] in fear of harassment repetition
* [[Defamation]] of character and reputation
* Effects on sexual life and relationships: can put extreme stress upon relationships with [[significant other]]s, sometimes resulting in divorce
* Firing and refusal for a job opportunity can lead to loss of job or career, loss of income
* Having one's personal life offered up for public scrutiny—the victim becomes the "accused", and his or her dress, lifestyle, and private life will often come under attack.
* Having to drop courses, change academic plans, or leave school (loss of tuition) in fear of harassment repetition or as a result of stress
* Having to relocate to another city, another job, or another school
* Loss of references/recommendations
* Loss of trust in environments similar to where the harassment occurred
* Loss of trust in the types of people that occupy similar positions as the harasser or his or her colleagues, especially in case they are not supportive, difficulties or stress on peer relationships, or relationships with colleagues
* Psychological stress and health impairment
* Weakening of support network, or being ostracized from professional or academic circles (friends, colleagues, or family may distance themselves from the victim, or shun him or her altogether)

[[Major depressive disorder|depression]]; [[anxiety]]; [[panic attack]]s; sleeplessness; [[nightmare]]s; [[shame]]; [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]; difficulty concentrating; headaches; [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]; loss of motivation; stomach problems; [[eating disorder]]s (such as weight loss or gain); [[alcoholism]]; feeling betrayed, violated, angry, violent towards the perpetrator, powerless or out of control; increased blood pressure; loss of confidence or self-esteem; withdrawal; [[Solitude|isolation]]; overall loss of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] in people; traumatic stress; [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD); [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]; [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]] or attempts, and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="SHSF_effects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html|deadurl=yes|title=Women's Crisis Support Services|date=9 July 2007|archivedate=9 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~counsel/harass.htm |title=Sexual Harassment: Myths and Realities |publisher=Uoregon.edu |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085341/http://www.uoregon.edu/~counsel/harass.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW_effects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopvaw.org/Effects_of_Sexual_Harassment.html |title=Effects of Sexual Harassment |publisher=Stop Violence Against Women |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="org_factor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/gender/encyclo/psy14ae.htm |title=Psychosocial and Organizational Factors: Sexual Harassment |publisher=Ilo.org |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220123857/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/gender/encyclo/psy14ae.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-complaint retaliation and backlash===
Retaliation and backlash against a victim are very common, particularly a complainant. Victims who speak out against sexual harassment are often labeled troublemakers who are on their own "power trips", or who are looking for attention. Similar to cases of [[rape]] or sexual assault, the victim often becomes the accused, with their appearance, private life, and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dittman, M. |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/harass.html |title=Sexual harassment too often leads to humiliation for victims |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=October 2003 |volume=34 |issue=9 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They risk hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow students, and even friends. They may become the targets of [[mobbing]] or [[relational aggression]].&lt;ref name="SHSF_effects"&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/effects.html Effects of Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118134554/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/effects.html |date=January 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are not necessarily sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues.&lt;ref name="webcom"&gt;[http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html Dealing With Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html |date=2007-07-09 }} (link is not active)&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility.&lt;ref name="backlash"&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html Sexual harassment retaliation, backlash, and victim blaming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215113203/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html |date=February 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women [[shunning|shunned]] her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit.&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, Clara; Gansler, Laura Leedy.

Retaliation has occurred when a sexual harassment victim suffers a negative action as a result of the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects [[sabotage]]d, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be [[firing|fired]] from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also [[stalking]] and [[cyberstalking]] of the victim.&lt;ref name="webcom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="backlash" /&gt; Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.

Of the women who have approached her to share their own experiences of being [[Sexual harassment in education|sexually harassed by their teachers]], [[Feminism|feminist]] and writer [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote in 2004:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf |first=Naomi |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html |title=The Silent Treatment |publisher=New York Metro |date=March 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083501/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another woman who was interviewed by sociologist Helen Watson said, "Facing up to the crime and having to deal with it in public is probably worse than suffering in silence. I found it to be a lot worse than the harassment itself."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Helen. "Red herrings and mystifications: Conflicting perceptions of sexual harassment," in Brant, Clare, and Too, Yun Lee, eds., ''Rethinking Sexual Harassment''.

===Backlash stress===
Backlash stress is stress resulting from an uncertainty regarding changing norms for interacting with women in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Taylor Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kimberly |last=Taylor Schneider |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bystander_Stress.html?id=gH18NQAACAAJ|title=Bystander Stress: The Effect of Organizational Tolerance of Sexual Harassment on Victim's Co-workers |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlash stress now deters many male workers from befriending female colleagues, or providing them with any assistance, such as holding doors open. As a result, women are being handicapped by a lack of the necessary networking and mentorship.&lt;ref name="daubney"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11904203/Well-done-feminism.-Now-man-are-afraid-to-help-women-at-work.html|title=Well done, feminism.

==Organizational policies and procedures==
Most companies have policies against sexual harassment, however these policies are not designed and should not attempt to "regulate romance" which goes against human urges.&lt;ref name="markschickman"/&gt;

Act upon a report of harassment inside the organization should be:

{{quote|The investigation should be designed to obtain a prompt and thorough collection of the facts, an appropriate responsive action, and an expeditious report to the complainant that the investigation has been concluded, and, to the full extent appropriate, the action taken.|Mark I. Schickman, Sexual Harassment. The employer's role in prevention. [[American Bar Association]]&lt;ref name="markschickman"&gt;Schickman, Mark I. Sexual Harassment. The employer's role in prevention. [[American Bar Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When organizations do not take the respective satisfactory measures for properly investigating, stress and psychological counseling and guidance, and just deciding of the problem this could lead to:
* Decreased productivity and increased team conflict
* Decreased study or job satisfaction
* Loss of students and staff. Loss of students who leave school and staff resignations to avoid harassment. Resignations and firings of alleged harassers.
* Decreased productivity and increased absenteeism by staff or students experiencing harassment
* Decrease in success at meeting academic and financial goals
* Increased health-care and sick-pay costs because of the health consequences of harassment or retaliation
* The knowledge that harassment is permitted can undermine ethical standards and discipline in the organization in general, as staff or students lose respect for, and trust in, their seniors who indulge in, or turn a blind eye to, or treat improperly sexual harassment
* If the problem is ignored or not treated properly, a company's or school's image can suffer
* High jury awards for the employee, attorney fees and litigation costs if the problem is ignored or not treated properly (in case of firing the victim) when the complainants are advised to and take the issue to court.&lt;ref name="techrep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW_effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="org_factor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boland, 1990{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janaraver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qnc.queensu.ca/story_loader.php?id=42b98262192e9 Sexual harassment bad for victims and for business] June 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/guides/S/63925/7 |title=For Help with the Handling of Harassment |publisher=Western Cape Government |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that [[organizational climate]] (an organization's tolerance, policy, procedure etc.) and workplace environment are essential for understanding the conditions in which sexual harassment is likely to occur, and the way its victims will be affected (yet, research on specific policy and procedure, and awareness strategies is lacking). Another element which increases the risk for sexual harassment is the job’s gender context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a field which is atypical for women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00067.x |title=A Meta-Analysis of the Antecedents and Consequences of Workplace Sexual Harassment |year=2007 |last1=Willness |first1=Chelsea R. |last2=Steel |first2=Piers |last3=Lee |first3=Kibeom |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=60 |pages=127–162|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.6532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Orit Kamir, the most effective way to avoid sexual harassment in the workplace, and also influence the public’s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and to make it very clear to their employees. Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to "air out the dirty laundry" with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.&lt;ref&gt;קמיר אורית, "החוק הישראלי למניעת הטרדה מינית- איפה אנחנו במלואת לו עשור? / "Israeli law against sexual harassment - where we all had a decade"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maryrowe"&gt;Rowe, Mary.

Most prefer a pragmatic solution that would stop the harassment and prevent future contact with the harasser rather than turning to the police. More about the difficulty in turning an offense into a legal act can be found in Felstiner &amp; Sarat's (1981) study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William L.F. |last1=Felstiner |first2=Richard L. |last2=Abel |first3=Austin |last3=Sarat |year=1980 |title=The Emergence and Transformation of Disputes: Naming, Blaming, Claiming… |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |volume=15 |issue=3/4 |pages=631–54 |jstor=3053505 |doi=10.2307/3053505}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes three steps a victim (of any dispute) must go through before turning to the justice system: naming – giving the assault a definition, blaming – understanding who is responsible for the violation of rights and facing them, and finally, claiming – turning to the authorities.

It may include a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda. ''The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Chicago Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-8070-3100-1}}; Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment is a form of [[Law|illegal]] [[employment discrimination]] in many countries, and is a form of [[abuse]] (sexual and [[psychological abuse]]s) and [[bullying]].

The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] classifies [[violence against women]] into three categories: that occurring in the family, that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. The term ''sexual harassment'' is used in defining violence occurring in the general community, which is defined as: "Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104.

Amended 23 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]]' [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) states, "It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex."

In India, the case of [[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan]] in 1997 has been credited with establishing sexual harassment as illegal.&lt;ref name="india_rape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/rape_laws.htm |title=Sexual Harassment and Rape Laws in India |publisher=Legal Service India |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, the 1988 Equal Employment Opportunity Law made it a crime for an employer to retaliate against an employee who had rejected sexual advances, but it wasn't until 1998 that the Israeli Sexual Harassment Law made such behavior illegal.&lt;ref name="Kamir" /&gt;

In May 2002, the [[European Union]] Council and Parliament amended a 1976 Council Directive on the equal treatment of men and women in employment to prohibit sexual harassment in the workplace, naming it a form of sex discrimination and violation of dignity. This Directive required all Member States of the European Union to adopt laws on sexual harassment, or amend existing laws to comply with the Directive by October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Legal_Framework.html?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={D7FABC81-256E-41C1-BF3A-563AD89AA809} Domestic Legal Framework] November 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varied legal guidelines and definitions===
'''The [[United Nations]] General Recommendation 19 to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' defines sexual harassment of women to include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;such unwelcome sexually determined behavior as physical contact and advances, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography and sexual demands, whether by words or actions. Such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it is discriminatory when the woman has reasonable ground to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment, including recruitment or promotion, or when it creates a hostile working environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While such conduct can be harassment of women by men, many laws around the world which prohibit sexual harassment recognize that both men and women may be harassers or victims of sexual harassment. However, most claims of sexual harassment are made by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment.cfm |title=Sexual Harassment Charges: EEOC &amp; FEPAs Combined: FY 1997 - FY 2011 |publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many similarities, and also important differences in laws and definitions used around the world.

* sexual harassment: where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] also addresses the issue of sexual harassment (Article 40), using a similar definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe - Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
Sexual harassment is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action is used to change a victim's sexual status against the will of the victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.&lt;ref name="Denmark law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.dk/regel/2/2002.html#LOV%20nr%201385 |title=Denmark Law |publisher=Ku.dk |accessdate=2012-10-07|date=2016-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In [[France]], both the Criminal Code and the Labor Code are relevant to the issue of sexual harassment. Until May 4, 2012, article 222-33 of the French Criminal Code described sexual harassment as "The fact of harassing anyone in order to obtain favors of a sexual nature".&lt;ref&gt;Art. 179 of the Law no. 2002-73 of 17 January 2002 on social modernization&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors. On May 4, 2012, the [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr Conseil constitutionnel] (French Supreme Court) quashed the definition of the criminal code as being too vague.&lt;ref&gt;Decision no. 2012-240 QPC of May 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 decision resulted from a law on priority preliminary rulings on the issue of constitutionality. As a consequence of this decision, all pending procedures before criminal courts were cancelled. Several feminist NGOs, such as AFVT, criticized this decision. President [[François Hollande]], the Minister of Justice (Christine Taubira) and the Minister of Equality (Najat Belkacem) asked that a new law be voted rapidly. As a result, ''LOI n°2012-954 du 6 août 2012'' was voted in, providing a new definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000021796942&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719 "Code pénal: Article 222-33" (in French)], ''legifrance.gouv.fr''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criminal provisions, the French Labor code also prohibits sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Act of 2 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The legislator voted a law in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Act of 27 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that copied the 2002/73/EC Directive&lt;ref&gt;Directive of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions&lt;/ref&gt; definition without modifying the French Labour Code.

====Germany====
Sexual harassment is no statutory offense in Germany. In special cases it might be chargeable as "Insult" (with sexual context) as per § 185 [[Strafgesetzbuch]] but only if ''special circumstances'' show an insulting nature.

The victim has only a right to self-defend while the attack takes place. If a perpetrator kisses or gropes the victim, they may only fight back while this is happening. If the victim would, for instance, slap back after the attacker already stopped, the victim might be chargeable for assault as per § 223 [[Strafgesetzbuch]].&lt;ref&gt;Nina Adelmann: [http://www.juraexamen.info/wp-content/uploads/jura.2009.24.pdf Die Straflosigkeit des »Busengrapschens«] (PDF; 123&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the governing coalition decided about the key points of a tightening of the law governing sexual offenses (Sexualstrafrecht, literally: law on the punishment of sexual delicts). At July 7, 2016 the Bundestag passed the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |date=2016-07-07 |title=Votum: Bundestag beschließt neues Sexualstrafrecht |journal=Spiegel Online |language=German |trans-title=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-beschliesst-neues-sexualstrafrecht-a-1101813.html |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by autumn 2016 the draft bill will be presented to the second chamber, the Bundesrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |date=2016-07-07 |title=Neues Sexualstrafrecht: Nein heißt Nein.

====Greece====
In response to the EU Directive 2002/73/EC, [[Greece]] enacted Law 3488/2006 (O.G.A.'.191). The law specifies that sexual harassment is a form of gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Victims also have the right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId%3D10297%26baseHREF%3Dcountry%26baseHREFId%3D563 |title=AW 3488/2006 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIELDS OF ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT, VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND PROMOTION, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WORK |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201171917/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10297&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=563 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this law, the policy on sexual harassment in Greece was very weak. Sexual harassment was not defined by any law, and victims could only use general laws, which were very poor in addressing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Tsekos, Mary Ellen, [http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/10/2tsekos.pdf "The New European Union Directive on Sexual Harassment and Its Implications for Greece"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722085849/http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/10/2tsekos.pdf |date=2014-07-22 }}, ''[[Center for Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Law|Human Rights Brief]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symeonidou-Kastanidou, E., [http://www.intellectum.org/articles/issues/intellectum3/en/ITL03p015025_Sexual%20Harassment%20in%20the%20Greek%20Criminal%20Law_Elissavet%20Symeonidou%20Kastanidou.pdf "The Sexual Harassment in Greek Criminal Law (Law 3488/2006)"], ''[[Intellectum]]'', 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
In the Criminal Code, Russian Federation, (CC RF), there exists a law which prohibits utilization of an office position and material dependence for coercion of sexual interactions (Article 118, current CC RF). However, according to the Moscow Center for Gender Studies, in practice, the courts do not examine these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?s=a1f5e83af0f492d74310d4d1a073b792&amp;showtopic=279 |title=Sexual Harassment in Russian Workplaces - Sexual Harassment Support Forum |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060132/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?s=a1f5e83af0f492d74310d4d1a073b792&amp;showtopic=279 |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' quotes a survey in which "100 percent of female professionals [in Russia] said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by their bosses, 32 per cent said they had had intercourse with them at least once and another seven per cent claimed to have been raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2470310/Sexual-harrassment-okay-as-it-ensures-humans-breed-Russian-judge-rules.html |title=Sexual harassment okay as it ensures humans breed, Russian judge rules |last1=Blomfield |first1=Adrian |date=29 Jul 2008 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
A ban on discrimination was included in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19950082/index.html|title=Federal Act on Gender Equality|last=|first=|date=1995-03-24|website=The Federal Council - The Portal of the Swiss Government|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Article 4 of the GEA of 1995 discusses the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace: "Any harassing behaviour of a sexual nature or other behaviour related to the person's sex that adversely affects the dignity of women or men in the workplace is discriminatory. Such behaviour includes in particular threats, the promise of advantages, the use of coercion and the exertion of pressure in order to obtain favours of a sexual nature."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The Discrimination Act of 1975, was modified to establish sexual harassment as a form of discrimination in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoc-law.org.uk/default.aspx?page=4666|title=Strathclyde Regional Council v Porcelli [1986&amp;#93; IRLR 134 Court of Session|work=eoc-law.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that harassment occurs where there is unwanted conduct on the ground of a person's sex or unwanted conduct of a sexual nature and that conduct has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. If an employer treats someone less favourably because they have rejected, or submitted to, either form of harassment described above, this is also harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=15657 |title=Sexual Harassment: what the law says |publisher=Eoc.org.uk |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831002533/http://www.eoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=15657 |archivedate=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Further|Sexism in India|Eveteasing|The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013}}
Sexual harassment in [[India]] is termed "[[Eve teasing]]" and is described as: unwelcome sexual gesture or behaviour whether directly or indirectly as sexually coloured remarks; physical contact and advances; showing pornography; a demand or request for sexual favours; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct being sexual in nature or passing sexually offensive and unacceptable remarks. The critical factor is the unwelcomeness of the behaviour, thereby making the impact of such actions on the recipient more relevant rather than intent of the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="india_rape" /&gt; According to the [[Indian constitution]], sexual harassment infringes the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her right to life and live with dignity under Article 21.&lt;ref name="amicus.iupindia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202183755/http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-12-02 |title=ICFAI University - Workplace Harassment |publisher=Amicus.iupindia.org |accessdate=2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of India]] in a [[Public Interest Litigation]], defined sexual harassment at workplace, preventive measures and redress mechanism. The judgment is popularly known as [[Vishaka Judgment]].&lt;ref name="Vishaka 001"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1031794/ |title=Vishaka &amp; Ors vs State Of Rajasthan &amp; Ors on 13 August 1997 |author1=Manohar, SV |author2=Kirpal, BN |journal=Supreme Court of India - |date=August 1997 |volume=241 |id=SCC Ref:(1997)6.

Almost 16 years after the Supreme Court's landmark guidelines on prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace (known as the "[[Vishaka Guidelines]]"), the Act has endorsed many of the guidelines, and is a step towards codifying gender equality. The Act is intended to include all women employees in its ambit, including those employed in the unorganized sector, as well as domestic workers.

The Act has identified sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and her right to life and to live with dignity under article 21 of the Constitution; as well as the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe environment free from sexual harassment. The Act also states that the protection against sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity are universally recognized human rights by international conventions and instruments such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has been ratified on the 25th June, 1993 by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]] introduced changes to the [[Indian Penal Code]], making sexual harassment an expressed offense under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.

====Israel====
The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offense to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as "prejudicial treatment".&lt;ref name="Kamir"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamir | first1 = Orit | year = | title = Israel's 1998 Sexual Harassment Law: Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Stalking, and Degradation Based on Sexual Orientation in the Workplace and in all Social Settings | url = http://sitemaker.umich.edu/Orit_Kamir/files/sexharas2.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Discrimination and Law | volume = 2005 | issue = 7| pages = 315–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual Harassment, or ''sekuhara'' in Japanese, appeared most dramatically in Japanese discourse in 1989, when a court case in Fukuoka ruled in favor of a woman who had been subjected to the spreading of sexual rumors by a co-worker. When the case was first reported, it spawned a flurry of public interest: 10 books were published, including English-language feminist guidebooks to ‘how not to harass women’ texts for men.&lt;ref name=Huen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huen|first1=Y|title=Workplace Sexual Harassment in Japan: A Review of Combating Measures Taken|journal=Asian Survey|date=2007|volume=47|issue=5|pages=811–827|doi=10.1525/as.2007.47.5.811|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/47/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sekuhara was named 1989’s ‘Word of the Year.’ The case was resolved in the victim’s favor in 1992, awarding her about $13,000 in damages, the first sexual harassment lawsuit in Japanese history.&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=MacGregor|first1=Hillary|title=In Japan, Many Men Just Don't Get It : Nation only got word for sexual harassment after '89 court case.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-13/news/mn-56533_1_sexual-harassment/2|journal=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 October 2015|date=13 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws then established two forms of sexual harassment: ''daisho'', in which rewards or penalties are explicitly linked to sexual acts, and ''kankyo'', in which the environment is made unpleasant through sexual talk or jokes, touching, or hanging sexually explicit posters. This applies to everyone in an office, including customers.&lt;ref name=Huen /&gt;

====Pakistan====
Pakistan has promulgated harassment law in 2010 with nomenclature as "The Protection Against Harassment of Women at The Workplace Act, 2010".
This law defines the act of harassment in following terms.
"Harassment means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitude, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to such a request or is made a condition for employment."
Pakistan has adopted a Code of Conduct for Gender Justice in the Workplace that will deal with cases of sexual harassment. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment At workplace (AASHA) announced they would be working with the committee to establish guidelines for the proceedings. AASHA defines sexual harassment much the same as it is defined in the U.S. and other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasha.org.pk/ |title=Alliance Against Sexual Harassment |publisher=AASHA |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
The Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 was enacted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;primarily to protect and respect the dignity of workers, employees, and applicants for employment as well as students in educational institutions or training centers. This law, consisting of ten sections, provides for a clear definition of work, education or training-related sexual harassment and specifies the acts constituting sexual harassment. It likewise provides for the duties and liabilities of the employer in cases of sexual harassment, and sets penalties for violations of its provisions. It is to be noted that a victim of sexual harassment is not barred from filing a separate and independent action for damages and other relief aside from filing the charge for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |title=Republic Act No. 7877 Anti Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 |publisher=Filipiniana.net |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713063240/http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Evolution of sexual harassment law====

=====Workplace=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}

In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[color]], [[national origin]] or [[religion]]. Initially intended to only combat sexual harassment of females, {42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2} the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers males and females. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm|title=Sexual Harassment|work=eeoc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment] October 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexual harassment" was coined and popularized by [[Lin Farley]] in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 [[Cornell University]] class she taught on women and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=lin+farley#v=onepage&amp;q=lin%20farley&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-09800-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' established sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v.

Vinson]], reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|EEOC]] per year before 1986 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=978-0700613236|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic%3D445 |title=Sexual Harassment Support Forum |accessdate=2006-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223845/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=445 |archivedate=2007-03-10 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v.

Ellerth |publisher=FindLaw |date=June 26, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White]]'', the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

During 2007 alone, the ''U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission'' and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=David |title=Sexual Harassment Law: A Brief Introduction for New Practitioners |url=http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners |publisher=Katz, Marshall &amp; Banks |accessdate=18 March 2011 |author2=Andronici, Justine |date=23 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203063912/http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 case, [[Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.]] ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and [[pornography]] are present. A [[hostile workplace]] may exist even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.employmentlawblog.info/2010/01/reeves-v-ch-robinson-worldwide-inc-no-07-10270-11th-cir-jan-20-2010.shtml|title=Reeves v.

From 2010 through 2016, approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were made by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charges Alleging Sex-Based Harassment (Charges filed with EEOC) FY 2010 - FY 2016|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in education in the United States}}
[[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 (United States) states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

In ''Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools'' (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court held that private citizens could collect damage awards when teachers sexually harassed their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0503_0060_ZS.html |title=Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools |publisher=Legal Information Institute |date=February 26, 1992 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser'' (1986) the courts ruled that schools have the power to discipline students if they use "obscene, profane language or gestures" which could be viewed as substantially interfering with the educational process, and inconsistent with the "fundamental values of public school education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Doug Linder |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/firstamendment/bethel.html |title=Bethel School District v. Fraser |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under regulations issued in 1997 by the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], which administers [[Title IX]], school districts should be held responsible for harassment by educators if the harasser "was aided in carrying out the sexual harassment of students by his or her position of authority with the institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/sexhar00.html |title=Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights |accessdate=2012-10-07|date=2018-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education'', and ''Murrell v. School Dist. No. 1'', 1999, schools were assigned liability for peer-to-peer sexual harassment if the plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated that the administration's response shows "deliberate indifference" to "actual knowledge" of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-843 |title=Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education |publisher=FindLaw |date=May 24, 1999 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kscourts.org/CA10/cases/1999/08/97-1055.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320085347/http://www.kscourts.org/CA10/cases/1999/08/97-1055.htm|date=March 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additionally====
There are a number of legal options for a complainant in the U.S.: [[mediation]], filing with the EEOC or filing a claim under a [[U.S. state|state]] Fair Employment Practices (FEP) statute (both are for workplace sexual harassment), filing a common law [[tort]], etc.&lt;ref name="whattodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/911/harasswhatdo.html |title=Sexual Harassment Fact Sheet: What to Do if You or Someone You Know is Sexually Harassed |publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sexual harassment will be considered severe enough to form the basis for a legal claim. However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The section below "EEOC Definition" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |title=Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education |date=January 19, 2001 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====EEOC Definition====
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.&lt;ref name="eeoc"/&gt; In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

1. and 2. are called "[[quid pro quo]]" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits, and "sexual coercion".

Type 3. known as "[[hostile work environment]]", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.&lt;ref name="webcom" /&gt;

'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a "right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====
[[File:Stop à la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]
Quid pro quo means "this for that". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html |title=The Law &amp; Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment? |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html Sexual Harassment In The Workplace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708062743/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html |date=July 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====
{{Main|Hostile work environment}}
This occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both "serious" and "frequent." Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html |title=The Law &amp; Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment? |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line between "[[quid pro quo]]" and "hostile environment" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment] 03/19/90&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hostile environment" harassment may acquire characteristics of "quid pro quo" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====
In the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.

=====Retaliation=====
Retaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment—any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php |title=Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, Sheila |accessdate=2006-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052101/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaliation is as illegal as the sexual harassment itself, but also as difficult to prove. Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.

== Historical antecedents ==

=== Ancient Rome ===
In [[ancient Rome]], according to [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1896 – 1970|Bruce W. Frier]] and [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1971 – 1990|Thomas A.J. McGinn]], what is now called ''sexual harassment''&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, [pbk.] 2004 ({{ISBN|0-19-516186-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;468 (author Frier prof. classics &amp; Roman law, Univ. of Michigan, &amp; coauthor McGinn assoc. prof. classical studies, Vanderbilt Univ.).&lt;/ref&gt; was then any of ''accosting'', ''stalking'', and ''abducting''. ''Accosting'' was "harassment through attempted seduction"&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; or {{Nowrap|"assault[ing]}} another's chastity with smooth talk&amp;nbsp;... contrary to good morals",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; which was more than the lesser offense(s) of "obscene speech, dirty jokes, and the like",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; "foul language",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; and "clamor",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; with the accosting of "respectable young girls" who however were dressed in slaves' clothing being a lesser offense&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; and the accosting of "women&amp;nbsp;... dressed as prostitutes" being an even lesser offense.&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; ''Stalking'' was "silently, persistently pursuing"&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; if it was "contrary to good morals",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-pp468-469"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;468–469.&lt;/ref&gt; because a pursuer's "ceaseless presence virtually ensures appreciable disrepute".&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; ''Abducting'' an attendant, who was someone who follows someone else as a companion and could be a slave,&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p469"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;469.&lt;/ref&gt; was "successfully forcing or persuading the attendant to leave the side of the intended target",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p469" /&gt; but abducting while the woman "has not been wearing respectable clothing" was a lesser offense.&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Though the phrase ''sexual harassment'' is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial. Accordingly, misunderstandings can occur. In the US, sexual harassment law has been criticized by persons such as the [[criminal defense lawyer]] [[Alan Dershowitz]] and the legal writer and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Eugene Volokh]], for imposing limits on the right to [[free speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Volokh |first=Eugene |url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass/ |title=Freedom of Speech vs. Workplace Harassment Law — A Growing Conflict |publisher=UCLA Law School |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jana Rave, professor in organizational studies at the [[Queen's School of Business]], criticized sexual harassment policy in the ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'' as helping maintain archaic stereotypes of women as "delicate, asexual creatures" who require special protection when at the same time complaints are lowering company profits.&lt;ref name="janaraver"&gt;Esau, Jeff. [http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1 Sexual harassment: Poisoning profit prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020062419/http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1 |date=2012-10-20 }} &lt;!-- prev. journal link http://www.ffeusa.org/html/statements/statements_harassment.html --&gt;, ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'', August 10, 2005. Retrieved on March 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm Playboy interview, Camille Paglia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622065038/http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm |date=June 22, 2006 }} May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics assert that sexual harassment is a very serious problem, but current views focus too heavily on sexuality rather than on the type of conduct that undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki Shultz, a law professor at [[Yale University]] comments, "Many of the most prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work—particularly the more highly rewarded lines of work—as bastions of male competence and authority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM Love, Lust, and the Law Sexual Harassment in the Academy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203104653/http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM |date=February 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist [[Jane Gallop]] sees this evolution of the definition of sexual harassment as coming from a "split" between what she calls "[[power feminist]]s" who are [[pro-sex]] (like herself) and what she calls "[[victim feminist]]s", who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a ''perversion'' of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Jane. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V1ZKUQtIVWEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment]''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Duke University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-1918-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern over abuses of sexual harassment policy by individuals as well as by employers and administrators using false or frivolous accusations as a way of expelling employees they want to eliminate for other reasons. These employees often have virtually no recourse thanks to the [[at-will]] law in most US states.&lt;ref&gt;Westhues, Kenneth. ''Eliminating Professors: A Guide to the Dismissal Process''. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-7734-8210-4}}.{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donohue and Bowers outlined 14 possible pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment: "lying, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia, false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy, personality disorders not otherwise specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jip.43 |title=Pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment |year=2006 |last1=O'Donohue |first1=William |last2=Bowers |first2=Adrian H. |journal=Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling |volume=3 |pages=47–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also discussion of whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and permissive habits have created a more sexualized general environment, in which some forms of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to greater sexualization in everyday environments.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kathleen. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_save_the_males_ho_culture_lights_fuses_b.html 'Save the males': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses]." ''New York Daily News''. June 30, 2008. Based on ''Save the Males'' by Kathleen Parker, 2008, Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many debates about how organizations should deal with sexual harassment. Some observers feel strongly that organizations should be held to a zero tolerance standard of "Must report - must investigate - must punish."

Others write that those who feel harassed should in most circumstances have a choice of options.&lt;ref name="maryrowe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoiBFMissing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowe|first=Mary|title=Negotiations and Change: From the Workplace to Society|year=2003|publisher=ILR Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9918">In [[mathematics]], '''signed measure''' is a generalization of the concept of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] by allowing it to have [[negative and positive numbers|negative]] values. Some authors may call it a '''charge,'''&lt;ref&gt;A charge need not be countably additive: it can be only [[Sigma additivity#Additive (or finitely additive) set functions|finitely additive]]. See reference {{Harvnb|Bhaskara Rao|Bhaskara Rao|1983}} for a comprehensive introduction to the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with [[electric charge]], which is a familiar distribution that takes on positive and negative values.

==Definition==
There are two slightly different concepts of a signed measure, depending on whether or not one allows it to take infinite values.  In research papers and advanced books signed measures are usually only allowed to take finite values, while undergraduate textbooks often allow them to take infinite values. To avoid confusion, this article will call these two cases "finite signed measures" and "extended signed measures".

Given a [[measurable space]] (''X'', Σ), that is, a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' with a [[sigma algebra]] Σ on it, an '''extended signed measure''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mu:\Sigma\to \mathbb {R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is [[sigma additivity|sigma additive]], that is, it satisfies the equality
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;
where the series on the right must converge absolutely, for any [[sequence]]  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of [[disjoint set]]s in Σ. One consequence is that any extended signed measure can take +∞ as value, or it can take &amp;minus;∞ as value, but both are not available. The expression ∞&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;∞ is undefined &lt;ref&gt;See the article "''[[Extended real number line#Arithmetic operations|Extended real number line]]''" for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; and must be avoided.

A '''finite signed measure''' (aka. '''real measure''') is defined in the same way, except that it is only allowed to take real values. That is, it cannot take +∞ or &amp;minus;∞.

Finite signed measures form a vector space, while extended signed measures are not even closed under addition, which makes them rather hard to work with. On the other hand,  measures are extended signed measures, but are not in general finite signed measures.

==Examples==
Consider a nonnegative measure ν on the space (''X'', Σ) and a [[measurable function]] ''f'':''X''→ '''R''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! |f(x)| \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Then, a finite signed measure is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu (A) = \int_A \! f(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''A'' in Σ.

This signed measure takes only finite values. To allow it to take +∞ as a value, one needs to replace the assumption about ''f'' being absolutely integrable with the more relaxed condition

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! f^-(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = max(&amp;minus;''f''(''x''), 0) is the [[positive and negative parts|negative part]] of ''f''.

==Properties==

What follows are two results which will imply that an extended signed measure is the difference of two nonnegative measures, and a finite signed measure is the difference of two finite non-negative measures.

The [[Hahn decomposition theorem]] states that given a signed measure μ, there exist two measurable sets ''P'' and ''N'' such that:

#''P''∪''N'' = ''X'' and  ''P''∩''N'' = ∅;
#μ(''E'') ≥ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''P'' &amp;mdash; in other words, ''P'' is a [[positive and negative sets|positive set]];
#μ(''E'') ≤ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''N'' &amp;mdash; that is, ''N'' is a negative set.
Moreover, this decomposition is unique [[up to]] adding to/subtracting μ-[[null set]]s from ''P'' and ''N''.

Consider then two nonnegative measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^+(E) = \mu(P\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^-(E)=-\mu(N\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

for all measurable sets ''E'', that is, ''E'' in Σ.

One can check that both μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are nonnegative measures, with one taking only finite values, and are called the ''positive part'' and ''negative part'' of μ, respectively. One has that μ = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The measure  |μ| = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is called the ''variation'' of μ, and its maximum possible value, ||μ|| = |μ|(''X''), is called the ''[[total variation]]'' of μ.

This consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is called the ''Jordan decomposition''. The measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and  |μ| are independent of the choice of ''P'' and ''N'' in the Hahn decomposition theorem.

==The space of signed measures==

The sum of two finite signed measures is a finite signed measure, as is the product of a finite signed measure by a real number: they are closed under [[linear combination]]. It follows that the set of finite signed measures on a measurable space (''X'', Σ) is a real [[vector space]]; this is in contrast to positive measures, which are only closed under [[conical combination]], and thus form a [[convex cone]] but not a vector space. Furthermore, the [[total variation]] defines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in respect to which the space of finite signed measures becomes a [[Banach space]]. This space has even more structure, in that it can be shown to be a [[Dedekind complete]] [[Riesz space|Banach lattice]] and in so doing the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]] can be shown to be a special case of the [[Freudenthal spectral theorem]].

If ''X'' is a compact separable space, then the space of finite signed Baire measures is the dual of the real Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on ''X'', by the  [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]].

  {{Feminism sidebar}}
In [[sociology]], a '''superwoman''' (also sometimes called '''supermom''') is a [[Western culture|Western woman]] who works hard to manage multiple roles of a worker, a [[homemaker]], a volunteer, a student, or other such time-intensive occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Girls Constructing Identity and Transforming "femininity": Intersections Between Empirical and Theoretical Understandings of 21st Century Girlhood|author=Jessica Laureltree Willis|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|isbn=0549870911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of "superwoman" differs from that of "[[career woman]]" in that the latter one commonly includes sacrifice of the family life in favor of career, while a superwoman strives to excel in both.&lt;ref name= serrin/&gt;

The term was also used in a somewhat similar context in the [[Stevie Wonder]] song "[[Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)|Superwoman]]", released 1972. It was the title of a 1975 book by [[Shirley Conran]]; she also wrote ''Superwoman 2'' (1977); ''Superwoman in Action'' (1979); and ''Down with Superwoman: for everyone who hates housework'' (1990).

A number of other terms are derived from "superwoman", such as '''superwoman syndrome''',&lt;ref name=shaevitz/&gt; '''superwoman squeeze''' (a pressure on a superwoman to perform well in her multiple roles),&lt;ref&gt;"The Superwoman Squeeze", ''[[Newsweek]]", May 19, 1980, pp. 72–79&lt;/ref&gt; and '''superwoman complex''' (an expectation of a superwoman that she can and should do everything).&lt;ref name= serrin&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HsMPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3IwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7025,3342599&amp;dq=superwoman-complex&amp;hl=en "Superwoman Complex A Pain In The Ego"], by Judith Serrin, ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', July 28, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz entitled her book ''The Superwoman Syndrome'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=shaevitz&gt;"The superwoman syndrome", by Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz, Morton H.

== Post second-wave feminism ==
{{See also|Second-wave feminism}}
The notion was first recognized in the post [[second-wave feminism]] [[United States|American]] society of 1970s–1980s, with the shift of the woman's traditional role of a [[housewife]] towards a more career-oriented way of life. This life involved the pursuit of both traditional female roles in the home and with [[children]], as well as the pursuit of traditionally [[masculine]] goals in the form of jobs and public [[social status]].

[[Betty Friedan]], an American [[feminist]], in her book ''[[The Second Stage]]'' argued that "superwomanhood" of the 1980s has led to double enslavement of women, both at home and at work. Her advice for feminists was to step up to the "second stage" of the feminist movement and to struggle for reshaping both [[gender role]]s and redefining social values, styles, and institutional structures, for the fulfillment to be achievable in both public and private lives without the necessity to sacrifice one for another.&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Thought: a more comprehensive introduction'', by Rosemarie Tong, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8133-3295-8}}, pp. 27, 28 (a summary of Friedan's position from ''The Second Stage'')&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toddler throwing a tantrum.ogg|thumb|Toddler throwing a [[tantrum]]]]

A '''tantrum''', '''temper tantrum''', '''meltdown''' or '''hissy fit''' is an [[emotion]]al [[wikt:outburst|outburst]], usually associated with children or those in emotional distress, that is typically characterized by [[wikt:stubborn|stubbornness]], [[crying]], [[screaming]], [[violence]], [[wikt:defy|defiance]], [[anger|angry]] [[wikt:rant|ranting]], a resistance to attempts at pacification, and, in some cases, hitting, and other physically violent behavior. Physical control may be lost; the person may be unable to remain still; and even if the "goal" of the person is met, he or she may not be calmed.&lt;ref name="babycentre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/toddler/penelopeleach/whatisatantrum/ |title=What is a tantrum? |publisher=Babycentre.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/behavior/tantrums.html |title=Temper Tantrums |publisher=Kidshealth.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_tantrums_11569.bc |title=Tantrums |publisher=BabyCenter |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/tantrum.html |title=When a Child Has a Tantrum – The Natural Child Project |publisher=Naturalchild.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A tantrum may be expressed in a tirade: a protracted, angry speech.&lt;ref name="babycentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth" /&gt;

==In early childhood==
Tantrums are one of the most common forms of problematic behavior in young children, but tend to decrease in frequency and intensity as the child grows older. For the [[toddler]], tantrums can be considered as normal, even as gauges of a developing strength of character.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1993) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kasketaldi_haurra_001.jpg|thumb|Child having a tantrum]]While tantrums are sometimes seen as a predictor of future [[anti-social behaviour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Potegal, Michael, L.P. |author2=Davidson, Richard J. | title = Temper Tantrums in Young Children| journal = Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics| volume = 24| issue = 3| pages = 140–147| date = June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another sense they are simply an age-appropriate sign of excessive [[frustration]], and will diminish over time given a calm and consistent handling.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Benaroch, ''Solving Health and Behavioral Problems from Birth Through Preschool'' (2008) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Parental containment where a child cannot contain itself—rather than what the child is ostensibly demanding—may be what is really required.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selma Fraiberg]] warned against "too much pressure or forceful methods of control from the outside" in child-rearing: "if we turn every instance of pants changing, treasure hunting, napping, puddle wading and garbage distribution into a governmental crisis we can easily bring on fierce defiance, tantrums, and all the fireworks of revolt in the nursery".&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual disabilites ==
Some people who have neurological disorders such as [[autism]], [[ADHD]], and [[intellectual disability]] could be more vulnerable to tantrums than others, although anyone experiencing brain damage (temporary or permanent) can suffer from tantrums. Anyone may be prone to tantrums once in a while, regardless of gender or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autism.lovetoknow.com/Temper_Tantrums_and_Autism|title=Temper Tantrums and Autism - LoveToKnow|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a meltdown due to [[sensory overload]] (which even [[neurotypical]] children can experience) is not the same as a temper tantrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennie|first1=Maureen|title=Tantrum vs Autistic Meltdown: What Is The Difference?|url=https://autismawarenesscentre.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-tantrum-and-an-autistic-meltdown/|website=Autism Awareness|publisher=Autism Awareness Centre Inc.|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aberrations==
[[Freud]] considered that the [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]'s development of temper tantrums was connected with his seduction by his sister: he became "discontented, irritable and violent, took offence on every possible occasion, and then flew into a rage and screamed like a savage".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Freud linked the tantrums to an unconscious need for punishment driven by feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;—something which he thought could be generalised to many other cases of childhood tantrums.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 257-8 and p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] contended that tantrums were [[narcissistic rages]],&lt;ref name="I. Goldenberg, 2007 p. 172"&gt;H. and I. Goldenberg, ''Family Therapy'' (2007) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the thwarting of the infant's [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]-[[exhibitionist]] core.  The blow to the inflated self-image, when a child's wishes are (however justifiably) refused, creates fury because it strikes at the feeling of [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="Gambling 1974 p. 182"&gt;[[Edmund Bergler]] in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jealousy]] over the birth of a sibling, and resulting aggression, may also provoke [[negativistic]] tantrums, as the effort at controlling the feelings overloads the child's system of self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==In later life==
[[Thackeray]] claimed that in later life "you may tell a Tantrum as far as you can see one, by the distressed and dissatisfied expression of its countenance—'Tantrumical', if we may term it so".&lt;ref&gt;William Makepeace Thackeray, ''The Irish Sketch Book'' (1848) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] contended that "the infant's core is likely to contain a self-centred, [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]-exhibitionist part", and that "tantrums at being frustrated thus represent [[narcissistic rages]]"&lt;ref name="I. Goldenberg, 2007 p. 172"/&gt; at the blow to the inflated self-image. With "a child confronted with some refusal ... regardless of its justifications, the refusal automatically provokes fury, since it offends his sense of [[omnipotence]]".&lt;ref name="Gambling 1974 p. 182"/&gt;

The willingness of the [[celebrity culture|celebrity]] to throw tantrums whenever thwarted to the least degree&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Lawrence, ''The Cult of Celebrity'' (2009) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[Acquired Situational Narcissism]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; or tantrumical behavior.

If tantrums are shown by older people they might often be signs of immaturity and a mental disability; however, many people can have them under extreme stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/health-news/adult-temper-tantrums-1.1126134|title=North Jersey|website=North Jersey|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist doctrine of '''the two truths''' ({{bo|w=bden pa gnyis}}) differentiates between two levels of ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit), meaning [[truth]] or "really existing" in the discourse of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]: the "conventional" or "provisional" ({{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}}) truth, and the "ultimate" ({{IAST|''paramārtha''}}) truth.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

The exact meaning varies between the various Buddhist schools and traditions. The best known interpretation is from the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[IAST|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, whose founder was [[Nagarjuna]].{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}} For Nagarjuna, the two truths are ''epistemological truths''. The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, phenomena are empty (''sunyata'') of an inherent self or essence, but exist [[Pratītyasamutpāda|depending on other phenomena]] (''Pratītyasamutpāda'').{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

In Chinese Buddhism, the [[Madhyamaka]] position is accepted and the two truths refer to two ''ontological truths''. Reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

The {{IAST|''śūnyatā''}} doctrine is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn't lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

==Etymology and meaning==
''[[Satya]]'' is usually taken to mean "truth", but does also refer to mean "a reality," "a genuinely real existent."{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=50}} "Satya" (Sat-yá)&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; is derived from [[Sat (Sanskrit)|''Sat'']] and ''ya''. ''Sat'' means being, reality, and is the [[present participle]] of the root ''as'' "to be" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁es-|*h₁es-]]}}''; cognate to English ''[[:wikt:is|is]]'').&lt;ref name=aam&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|A. A. Macdonell]], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120617797}}, page 330-331&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ya'' and ''yam'' means "advancing, supporting, hold up, sustain, one that moves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=yA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 yA] Sanskrit English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html ''yam''] Monier Williams' Sanskrit English Dictionary, Univ of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; As a composite word, ''Satya'' and ''Satyam'' imply that "which supports, sustains and advances reality, being"; it literally means, "that which is true, actual, real, genuine, trustworthy, valid".&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;

The two truths doctrine states that there is:
* ''Provisional ''or conventional truth ([[Sanskrit]] {{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}}''-satya'', [[Pāli]] ''sammuti sacca'', [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] ''kun-rdzob bden-pa''), which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and
* ''Ultimate'' truth (Sanskrit, ''paramārtha-satya'', Pāli ''paramattha sacca'', Tibetan: ''don-dam bden-pa''), which describes the ultimate reality as ''[[sunyata]]'', empty of concrete and inherent characteristics.

[[Chandrakirti|Chandrakīrti]] suggests three possible meanings of {{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}} :{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}
# complete covering or the 'screen' of ignorance which hides truth
# existence or origination through dependence, mutual conditioning
# worldly behavior or speech behavior involving designation and designatum, cognition and cognitum.

The conventional truth may be interpreted as "obscurative truth" or "that which obscures the true nature" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.&lt;ref name="LevinsonAug06"&gt;Levinson, Jules (August 2006) ''[http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf Lotsawa Times Volume II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083326/http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Buddha's teaching of ({{IAST|''dharma''}}) may be viewed as a path ({{IAST|''mārga''}}) of release from the anxieties of life. The first Noble Truth equates life-experiences with pain and suffering. Buddha's language was simple and colloquial. Naturally, various statements of Buddha at times appear contradictory to each other. Later Buddhist teachers were faced with the problem of resolving these contradictions. Nagarjuna and other teachers introduced an exegetical technique level-distinction between two levels of truth, the conventional and the ultimate.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

A similar method is reflected in the Brahmanical exegesis of the Vedic scriptuires which combine the ritualistic injunctions of the [[Brahmanas|Brahmana]] and speculative philosophical questions of the [[Upanishads]] as one whole 'revealed' body of work thereby contrasting the {{IAST|''jñāna kāņḍa''}} with {{IAST|''karmakāņḍa''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

==Origin and development==
While the concept of the two truths is associated with the [[Madhyamaka]] school, its history goes back to the oldest Buddhism.

===Early Indian Buddhism===

====Pali Canon====
In the Pali canon, the distinction is not made between a lower ''truth'' and a higher ''truth'', but rather between two kinds of expressions of the same truth, which must be interpreted differently. Thus a phrase or passage, or a whole sutta, might be classed as ''neyyattha'' or ''samuti'' or ''vohāra'', but it is not regarded at this stage as expressing or conveying a different level of ''truth''.

''Nītattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''nītārtha''), "of plain or clear meaning"&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams"&gt;Monier-Williams&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neyyattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''neyartha''), "[a word or sentence] having a sense that can only be guessed".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams"/&gt; These terms were used to identify texts or statements that either did or did not require additional interpretation. A ''nītattha'' text required no explanation, while a ''neyyattha'' one might mislead some people unless properly explained:&lt;ref&gt;McCagney: 82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There are these two who misrepresent the [[Tathagata]].  Which two?  He who represents a [[Sūtra|Sutta]] of indirect meaning as a Sutta of direct meaning and he who represents a Sutta of direct meaning as a Sutta of indirect meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anguttara Nikaya]]'' I:60 (Jayatilleke: 361, in McCagney: 82)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''{{IAST|Saṃmuti}}'' or ''{{IAST|samuti}}'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|saṃvṛti}}'', meaning "common consent, general opinion, convention",&lt;ref&gt;PED&lt;/ref&gt; and ''paramattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''paramārtha''), meaning "ultimate", are used to distinguish conventional or common-sense language, as used in metaphors or for the sake of convenience, from language used to express higher truths directly. The term ''vohāra'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''vyavahāra'', "common practice, convention, custom" is also used in more or less the same sense as ''samuti''.

====Theravāda====
The [[Theravada|Theravādin]] commentators expanded on these categories and began applying them not only to expressions but to the truth then expressed:
{{quote|The Awakened One, the best of teachers, spoke of two truths, conventional and higher; no third is ascertained; a conventional statement is true because of convention and a higher statement is true as disclosing the true characteristics of events.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Khathāvatthu Aṭṭha kathǎ}}'' (Jayatilleke: 363, in McCagney: 84)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Prajnāptivāda====
The [[Prajñaptivāda]] school took up the distinction between the conventional and ultimate (''paramārtha/{{IAST|saṃvṛti}}''), and extended the concept to [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|metaphysical-phenomenological constituents]] (''dharmas''), distinguishing those that are real (''tattva'') from those that are purely conceptual, i.e., ultimately nonexistent (''prajnāpti'').

===Indian Mahayana Buddhism===

====Madhyamaka====
The distinction between the two truths (''satyadvayavibhāga'') was fully developed by [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) of the [[Madhyamaka]] school.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} The Madhyamikas distinguish between ''loka-samvriti-satya'', "world speech truth" c.q. "relative truth"&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl031604.html ''The Urban Dharma Newsletter. March 16, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; c.q. "truth that keeps the ultimate truth concealed,"{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}} and ''paramarthika satya'', ultimate truth.&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;

''Loka-samvriti-satya'' can be further divided in ''tathya-samvrti'' or ''loka-samvrti'', and ''mithya-samvrti'' or ''aloka-samvrti'',{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=285}}{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}} "true samvrti" and "false samvrti."{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}}&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Lal Mani Joshi, [[Bhāviveka]] (6th century CE), the founder of the [[Svātantrika]]subschool of the Mādhyamaka, classified ''samvrti'' into ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti''.{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}} [[Candrakīrti]] (7th century CE), one of the main proponents of the [[Prasaṅgika]] subschool of Madhyamaka, divided ''samvrti'' into ''loka-samvrti'' and ''aloka-samvrti''.{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=285}} [[Shantideva]] (8th century CE) and his commentator Prajñakaramati (950-1030&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Praj%C3%B1akaramati Rigpawiki, ''Prajñakaramati'']&lt;/ref&gt;) both use the terms ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti''.{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}} [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], an influential 8th-century Mimamsa-philosopher, in commenting on Madhyamaka philosophy, also uses the terms ''loka-samvrti'' and ''aloka-samvrti''.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}} Murti, in his ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', uses the term ''aloka'', and refers to the synonym ''mithya samvrti''.{{sfn|Murti|2013|p=245}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murti: "In calling it 'loka samvrti,' it is implied that there is some appearance which is 'aloka' - non-empirical, i.e. false for the emprical consciousness even."{{sfn|Mrti|2013|p=245}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Seyfort Ruegg further comments: "The ''samvrti'' in worldly usage is termed ''lokasamvrti''; and while it can serve no real purpose to distinguish an ''alokasamvrti'' opposed to it (from the point of view of ultimate reality both are unreal, though in different degrees from the relative standpoint), one may nevertheless speak of an ''alokasamvrti'' as distinct from it when considering that there exist persons who can be described as 'not of the world' (''alokah'') since they have experiences which are falsified because of the fact that their sense-faculties are impaired (and which, therefore, do not belong to the general worldly consensus."{{sfn|Seyfort Ruegg|1981|p=74-75}}}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt; ''Tathya-samvrti'' or "true samvrti" refers to "things" which concretely exist and can be perceived as such by the senses, while ''mithya-samvrti'' or "false samvrti" refers to false cognitions of "things" which do not exist as they are perceived.{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}}&lt;ref group=web name="Sulekha.com"&gt;[http://creative.sulekha.com/refutation-of-advaita-kumarila-part-2_325305_blog Sulekha.com, ''Refutation of Advaita:Kumarila Part 2'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|An often-used explanation in Madhyamaka literature is the perception of a snake.

Ultimately both are false, but "the snake-seen-in-the-rope" is less true than the "snake-seen-in-the-snake."

Atman and Brahman, which according to the Buddha is ''asat'', "something that does not exist."{{sfn|Gombrich|1990|p=15}} Compare also [[Atiśa]]: "One may wonder, "From where did all this come in the first place, and to where does it depart now?"

Nagarjuna's ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' provides a logical defense for the claim that all things are empty ([[sunyata]]) of an inherently-existing self-nature.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata, however, is also shown to be "empty," and Nagarjuna's assertion of "the emptiness of emptiness" prevents sunyata from constituting a higher or ultimate reality.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}}{{refn|group=note|Some have interpreted ''paramarthika satya'' or "ultimate truth" as constituting a metaphysical 'Absolute' or [[noumenon]], an "ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason."{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} For example T.R.V. Murti (1955), ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', who gave a [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] interpretation.{{sfn|Westerhoff|2009|p=9}}}} Nagarjuna's view is that "the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth".{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} According to Siderits, Nagarjuna is a "semantic anti-dualist" who posits that there are only conventional truths.{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} [[Jay L. Garfield]] explains:
{{quote|Suppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts [...] So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness […]. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table’s lack of inherent existence [...] To see the table as empty [...] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}}}

In [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' the two truths doctrine is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') with emptiness (''śūnyatā''):
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna, Mūlamadhyamakakārika 24:8–10. Jay L. Garfield|''Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way'': pp. 296, 298&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Nagarjuna's own words:
{{quote|8. The teaching by the Buddhas of the dharma has recourse to two truths:&lt;br&gt;
The world-ensconced truth and the truth which is the highest sense.&lt;br&gt;
9. Those who do not know the distribution (vibhagam) of the two kinds of truth&lt;br&gt;
Do not know the profound "point" (tattva) in the teaching of the Buddha.&lt;br&gt;
10. The highest sense of the truth is not taught apart from practical behavior,&lt;br&gt;
And without having understood the highest sense one cannot understand nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orientalia.org/article492.html Mūlamadhyamakakārikā Verse 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100348/http://www.orientalia.org/article492.html |date=February 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] based his statement of the two truths on the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta. In the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], speaking to the monk Kaccayana Gotta on the topic of right view, describes the middle Way between nihilsm and eternalism:
{{quote|By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "non-existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html Kaccāyanagotta Sutta on Access to Insight] (accessed: January 2, 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511184737/http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html |date=May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Chattopadhyaya, although Nagarjuna presents his understanding of the two truths as a clarification of the teachings of the Buddha, the two truths doctrine as such is not part of the earliest Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|p=21-3,94,104}}

====Buddhist Idealism====

=====Yogacara=====
The [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism distinguishes the [[Yogacara#The Three Natures|Three Natures]] and the [[Trikaya]]. The Three Natures are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Epistemology|author=S.R. Bhatt &amp; Anu Meherotra|pages=7|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=107|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Paramarthika'' (transcendental reality), also referred to as ''Parinispanna'' in Yogacara literature:''The level of a storehouse of consciousness that is responsible for the appearance of the world of external objects. It is the only ultimate reality.''
*''Paratantrika'' (dependent or empirical reality): ''The level of the empirical world experienced in ordinary life''. For example, the snake-seen-in-the-snake.
*''Parikalpita'' (imaginary). For example, the snake-seen-in-a-dream.

=====Lankavatara Sutra=====
The Lankavatara Sutra took an idealistic turn in apprehending reality. [[D. T. Suzuki]] writes the following:
{{quote|The ''Lanka'' is quite explicit in assuming two forms of knowledge: the one for grasping the absolute or entering into the realm of Mind-only, and the other for understanding existence in its dual aspect in which logic prevails and the Vijnanas are active. The latter is designated Discrimination (''vikalpa'') in the ''Lanka'' and the former transcendental wisdom or knowledge (''prajna''). To distinguish these two forms of knowledge is most essential in Buddhist philosophy.}}

When Buddhism came to China from [[Greco-Buddhism#Gandharan proselytism|Gandhara]] (now Afghanistan) and [[India]] in the first/second century CE, it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}} and [[Taoism|Taoist]]{{sfn|Goddard |2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Verstappen|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} influences. [[Neo-Daoism|Neo-Taoist]] concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|Oh|2000}} Concepts such as [[Essence-Function|"T’i -yung"]] (Essence and Function) and "Li-Shih" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism,{{sfn|Oh|2000}} which consequently influenced Chán deeply.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}}

The two truths doctrine was another point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Taoists at first misunderstood [[sunyata]] to be akin to the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}} In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

====Hua-yen Buddhism====
{{Main article|Huayan school}}

The Huayan school or Flower Garland is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] that flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]]. It is based on the Sanskrit [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'', C. ''Huayan Jing'') and on a lengthy Chinese interpretation of it, the [[Huayan Lun]].  The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of profound understanding.

The most important philosophical contributions of the Huayan school were in the area of its metaphysics. It taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing.

Distinctive features of this approach to Buddhist philosophy include:
* Truth (or reality) is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa
* Good is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating evil
* Similarly, all mind-made distinctions are understood as "collapsing" in the enlightened understanding of emptiness (a tradition traced back to the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]])

Huayan teaches the [[Four Dharmadhatu]], four ways to view reality:
# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events;
# All events are an expression of the absolute;
# Events and essence interpenetrate;
# All events interpenetrate.{{sfn|Garfield|2011|p=76}}

====Absolute and relative in Zen====
{{main article|Zen}}
[[File:DogenP2.JPG|thumb|[[Dogen]]]]

The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature - sunyata,{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative,{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} sudden and gradual enlightenment.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}}

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita Sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[Heart Sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}
The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]].

====Essence-function in Korean Buddhism====
{{See also|Korean Buddhism|Essence-Function}}

The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as "essence-function". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not "exclude any other frameworks such as ''neng-so'' or "subject-object" constructions", though the two "are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae  (1983). ''Buddhist Faith and Sudden Enlightenment.'' SUNY series in religious studies. SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-87395-673-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87395-673-4}}.

In Korean Buddhism, essence-function is also expressed as "body" and "the body's functions":
{{quote|[A] more accurate definition (and the one the Korean populace is more familiar with) is "body" and "the body's functions". The implications of "essence/function" and "body/its functions" are similar, that is, both paradigms are used to point to a nondual relationship between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae (2009). ''One Korean's approach to Buddhism: the mom/momjit paradigm''. SUNY series in Korean studies: SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-7697-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7697-0}}.

A metaphor for essence-function is "A lamp and its light", a phrase from the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', where Essence is lamp and Function is light.&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Whalen (1979). "Ch'an Metaphors: waves, water, mirror, lamp". ''Philosophy East &amp; West''; Vol. 29, no.3, July, 1979, pp.245–253.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

====Nyingma====
The '''Nyingma''' tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. It is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], in the eighth century. [[Ju Mipham]] (1846–1912) in his commentary to the ''[[Madhyamālaṃkāra]]'' of [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) says:&lt;ref&gt;Commentary to the first [[couplet]] of [[quatrain]]/[[śloka]] 72 of the root text, (725–788) — Blumenthal, James (2008). "Śāntarakṣita", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Source: [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/saantarak-sita/] (accessed: February 28, 2009), as rendered into English by the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (2005: p. 304)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If one trains for a long time in the union of the two truths, the stage of acceptance (on the path of joining), which is attuned to primordial wisdom, will arise. By thus acquiring a certain conviction in that which surpasses intellectual knowledge, and by training in it, one will eventually actualize it. This is precisely how the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas have said that liberation is to be gained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Ju Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"Primordial wisdom" is a rendering of ''[[jñāna]]'' and "that which surpasses intellectual knowledge" may be understood as the direct perception (Sanskrit: ''[[pratyakṣa]]'') of(''[[dharmata|dharmatā]]''). "Conviction" may be understood as a gloss of [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (''śraddhā'').  An effective analogue for "union", a rendering of the relationship held by the two truths, is ''[[Interpenetration (Buddhism)|interpenetration]]''.}}}}

The following sentence from [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]]'s exegesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s'' [[Madhyamālaṃkāra]]'' highlights the relationship between the absence of ''[[Catuṣkoṭi#Four Extremes|the four extremes]]'' (''mtha'-bzhi'') and the [[nondual]] or ''[[Two Truths|indivisible two truths]]'' (''bden-pa dbyer-med''):
{{quote|The learned and accomplished [masters] of the Early Translations considered this simplicity beyond the four extremes, this abiding way in which the two truths are indivisible, as their own immaculate way.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Thomas H. (trans.) Mipham, Jamgon Ju.(author)(2004). '' Speech of Delight: Mipham's Commentary of Shantarakshita's Ornament of the Middle Way''. Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-217-7}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blankleder|Blankleder]] and [[Wulstan Fletcher|Fletcher]] of the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] give a somewhat different translation:&lt;br&gt;
"The learned and accomplished masters of the Old Translation school take as their stainless view the freedom from all conceptual constructs of the four extremes, the ultimate reality of the two truths inseparably united."&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

====Dzogchen====
[[Dzogchen]] holds that the two truths are ultimately resolved into non-duality as a lived experience and are non-different.

==Understanding in other traditions==

===Jainism===
The Jain philosopher [[Kundakunda]] was influenced by Nagarjuna to develop a Jain version of the theory of two truths.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In texts such as Pravacanasāra
(‘The Essence of the Doctrine’) and Samayasāra (‘The Essence of the Soul’), Kundakunda distinguishes between two perspectives of truth:

*''vyavahāranaya'' or ‘mundane perspective’
*''niścayanaya'' or ‘ultimate perspective’, also called “supreme” (''paramārtha'') and “pure” (''śuddha'')&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kundakunda, the mundane realm of truth is also the relative perspective of normal folk, where the workings of [[karma]] operate and where things emerge, last for a certain duration and perish. The ultimate perspective meanwhile, is that of the liberated [[jiva]], which is "blissful, energetic, perceptive, and omniscient".&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advaita Vedanta===
Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Chattopadhyaya, the Advaita Vedantists retain the term paramartha-satya or parmarthika-satya for the ultimate truth, and for the ''loka samvriti'' of the Madhyamakas they use the term ''vyahvarika satya'' and for ''aloka samvriti'' they use the term ''pratibhasika'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=107, 104|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
* {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
* {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

===Mīmāṃsā refutation of Two Truths Doctrine===
Chattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century [[Mīmāṃsā]] philosopher [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] rejected the ''Two Truths Doctrine'' in his ''Shlokavartika''.&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"/&gt; Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the [[decline of Buddhism in India]]{{sfn|Sheridan|1995|p=198-201}} since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline.{{sfn|Sharma|1980|p=5-6}} According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that "the theory of the nothingness of the objective world" is absurd:
{{quote|[O]ne should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be.&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa: "The idealist talks of some 'apparent truth' or 'provisional truth of practical life', i.e. in his terminology, of ''samvriti satya''. However, since in his own view, there is really no truth in this 'apparent truth', what is the sense of asking us to look at it as some special brand of truth as it were? If there is truth in it, why call it false at all? And, if it is really false, why call it a kind of truth?

Truth and falsehood, being mutually exclusive, there cannot be any factor called 'truth' as belonging in common to both--no more than there can by any common factor called 'treeness' belonging to both the tree and the lion, which are mutually exclusive.

On the idealist's own assumption, this 'apparent truth' is nothing but a synonym for the 'false'. Why, then, does he use this expression? Because it serves for him a very important purpose. It is the purpose of a verbal hoax. It means falsity, though with such a pedantic air about it as to suggest something apparently different, as it were. This is in fact a well known trick. Thus, to create a pedantic air, one can use the word ''vaktrasava'' [literally mouth-wine] instead of the simpler word ''lala'', meaning saliva [''vancanartha upanyaso lala-vaktrasavadivat''].

But why is this pedantic air? Why, instead of simply talking of falsity, is the verbal hoax of an 'apparent truth' or samvriti? The purpose of conceiving this samvriti is only to conceal the absurdity of the theory of the nothingness of the objective world, so that it can somehow be explained why things are imagined as actually existing when they are not so.

Instead of playing such verbal tricks, therefore, one should speak honestly. This means: one should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be."&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=370–1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;}}

===Correspondence with Pyrrhonism===
[[Thomas McEvilley|McEvilley]] (2002) notes a correspondence between Greek [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Madhyamika]] doctrines:
{{quote|Sextus says &lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empericus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', II.14–18; ''Anthologia Palatina'' (Palatine Anthology), VII. 29–35, and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt; that there are two criteria:
# [T]hat by which we judge reality and unreality, and
# [T]hat which we use as a guide in everyday life.
According to the first criterion, nothing is either true or false[.] [I]nductive statements based on direct observation of phenomena may be treated as either true or false for the purpose of making everyday practical decisions.&lt;br&gt;
The distinction, as Conze&lt;ref&gt;Conze 1959, pp. 140–141)&lt;/ref&gt; has noted, is equivalent to the Madhyamika distinction between "Absolute truth" (''paramārthasatya''), "the knowledge of the real as it is without any distortion,"&lt;ref name="Conze 1959: p. 244"&gt;Conze (1959: p. 244)&lt;/ref&gt; and "Truth so-called" (''saṃvṛti satya''), "truth as conventionally believed in common parlance.&lt;ref name="Conze 1959: p. 244"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 }}, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;}}
