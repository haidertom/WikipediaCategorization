      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2014">The word "'''''abhidhéya'''''" is a [[Sanskrit]] [[Terminology|term]] which, along with ''[[sambandham]]'' and ''[[prayojana]]'', is one of the three fundamental concepts of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]]. It denotes a means of achieving the ultimate goal, [[Bhakti Yoga|dedicated ministry]] in the stage of practice ''[[Sadhana|Sadhana-Bhakti]]''. ''Abhidheya'' is what a person must develop to achieve the ultimate goal&amp;mdash;''[[Prem (Hinduism)|prem]]'', or pure love of [[Krishna]], which is considered the highest achievement of the ''[[prayojana]]''.

The concepts ''sambandha'', ''abhidheya'' and ''prayojana'' are explained in the works of theologians such as [[Rupa Goswami]] and [[Raghunatha dasa Goswami]]. ''Abhidheya'' is a ''[[Sadhana]]'', a spiritual practice performed by a man after he realized the ''sambandhu'' - the original relationship with [[Krishna]]. ''Abhideya'' is an activity aimed at meeting Krishna, pure, selfless service to Krishna, which is a means of understanding the eternal relationship of love between Krishna and the smallest ''jiva''.

The eternal relationship ''[[jiva]]'' with Krishna is described in Vedic literature. Information on these relationships is called ''sambandha''. Understanding these relationships and the subsequent effect on the basis of this understanding is called ''Abhidheya''. Reaching ''Prem'', or pure love of [[Krishna]] and returning to [[Goloka|the spiritual world]], the society of Krishna and its satellites, is the ultimate goal of life, which is called ''prayojana''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7969">The theory of '''accessible categories''' is a part of [[mathematics]], specifically of [[category theory]]. It attempts to describe categories in terms of the "size" (a [[cardinal number]]) of the operations needed to generate their objects. 

The theory originates in the work of [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] completed by 1969&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been further developed in 1989 by [[Michael Makkai]] and Robert Paré, with motivation coming from [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;

A standard text book by Adámek and Rosický appeared in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Accessible categories also have applications in [[homotopy theory]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;J. Rosický [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2185 "On combinatorial model categories"], ''[[arXiv]]'', 16 August 2007. Retrieved on 19 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Rosický, J. "Injectivity and accessible categories." ''Cubo Matem. Educ'' 4 (2002): 201-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Grothendieck continued the development of the theory for homotopy-theoretic purposes in his (still partly unpublished) 1991 manuscript ''Les dérivateurs''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Some properties of accessible categories depend on the [[Axiomatic set theory|set universe]] in use, particularly on the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] properties and [[Vopěnka's principle]].&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed Colimits and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable Objects==
Let &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; be an infinite [[regular cardinal]], i.e. a [[cardinal number]] that is not the sum of a smaller number of smaller cardinals; examples are &lt;math&gt;\aleph _{0}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Aleph number|aleph-0]]), the first infinite cardinal number, and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{1} &lt;/math&gt;, the first uncountable cardinal). A [[partially ordered set]] &lt;math&gt;(I, \leq) &lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed''' if every subset &lt;math&gt;J &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt; of cardinality less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; has an upper bound in &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the ordinary [[Directed set|directed sets]] are precisely the &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-directed sets.

Now let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. A [[direct limit]] (a.k.a. directed colimit) over a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed set &lt;math&gt;(I, \leq) &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit'''. An object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;'''-presentable''' if the [[Hom functor]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X,-)&lt;/math&gt; preserves all &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimits in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear that every &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable object is also &lt;math&gt;\kappa'&lt;/math&gt;-presentable whenever  &lt;math&gt;\kappa\leq\kappa'&lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;\kappa'&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit is also a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit in that case. A &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-presentable object is called '''finitely presentable'''. 

===Examples===
*In the category '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of all sets, the finitely presentable objects coincide with the finite sets. The &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable objects are the sets of cardinality smaller than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

*In the [[Category of groups|category of all groups]], an object is finitely presentable if and only if it is a [[Presentation_of_a_group#finitely_presented|finitely presented group]], i.e. if it has a presentation with finitely many generators and finitely many relations. For uncountable regular &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable objects are precisely the groups with cardinality smaller than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

*In the [[Category of modules|category of left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules]] over some (unitary, associative) [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the finitely presentable objects are precisely the [[Finitely_generated_module#Finitely_presented,_finitely_related,_and_coherent_modules|finitely presented module]]s.

=={{Anchor|locally_presentable}} &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible and locally presentable categories==
The category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible''' provided that:

* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has all &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimits
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; contains a set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable objects such that every object of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit of objects of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

An &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-accessible category is called '''finitely accessible'''.
A category is called '''accessible''' if it is &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible for some infinite regular cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. 
When an accessible category is also [[cocomplete]], it is called '''locally presentable'''.

A functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible categories is called '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible''' provided that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; preserves &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimits. 

===Examples===

* The category '''Set''' of all sets and functions is locally finitely presentable, since every set is the direct limit of its finite subsets, and finite sets are finitely presentable.

* The category &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-Mod of (left) &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules is locally finitely presentable for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

* The category of [[simplicial set]]s is finitely accessible.

* The category Mod(T) of models of some [[first-order theory]] T with countable signature is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; -accessible. &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; -presentable objects are models with a countable number of elements.

* Further examples of locally presentable categories are finitary algebraic categories (i.e. the categories corresponding to [[Variety (universal algebra)|varieties of algebras]] in [[Universal algebra|univeral algebra]]) and [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]].

==Theorems==
One can show that every locally presentable category is also [[Complete category|complete]].&lt;ref&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994, remark 1.56&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a category is locally presentable if and only if it is equivalent to the category of models of a limit [[Sketch (mathematics)|sketch]].&lt;ref&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994, corollary 1.52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adjoint functors]] between locally presentable categories have a particularly simple characterization. A functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; between locally presentable categories:

* is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves small colimits
* is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves small limits and is accessible

'''Anubandha chatushtaya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अनुबन्ध चतुष्टय) literally means four connections, and therefore, it is four-fold in nature and content viz, – a) ''adhikāri'' ('the qualified student') who has developed ''[[Ekagrata|ekāgrata]]'' ('single pointed mind'), ''chitta shuddhi'' ('purity of the mind') and ''[[Vikṣepa|vikshepa]]'' ('freedom from restlessness and impurity') or ''adhikāra'' (''aptitude''); b) ''vishaya'' ('subject matter' or 'the theme') pertaining to the '' [[Jiva]]-[[Brahman]] identity''; c) ''[[prayojana]]'' or '' phalasruti'' ('result' or 'fruit') which is ''atyantika-dukha-nivritti'' ('complete cessation of sorrow') and ''paramānanda-prāpti'' ('attainment of supreme happiness'), and d) ''[[sambandha]]'' ('relationship' or 'intertextuality') between ''adhikāra'', ''vishaya'' and ''prayojana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aldous Huxley and Indian Thought|publisher=Sterling Publishers|page=16|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EK3E6epYXmEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Anubandha+chatushtaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZSjVPaOB9DUuQS204LwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anubandha%20chatushtaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

[[Sadananda (of Vedantasara)|Sadananda]] reminds that:-

:तत्र अनुबन्धो नाम अधिकारिविषयसंबन्धप्रयोजनानि |

: "The preliminary questions of the Vedanta are the determination of the competency of the student, the subject-matter, its connection with the book and the necessity of for its study." – [[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]] (sutra I.5)

a)- ''Adhikāra'' is the capacity to study (''adhyana'') the subject-matter in which respect there exist doubts (''sandigdhata'') which is the basis of the intended inquiry into that particular subject-matter for the eventual removal of all doubts and gain of its proper understanding. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] speaks about three levels of ''adhikāra'' – ''adhama'' ('lower'), ''madhyma'' ('middle') and ''uttama'' ('higher'), the last two levels indicate that the student is of peaceful mind (''śanta''), is understanding and has non-repressed sense-control (''danta''), has withdrawn from worldly objects (''uparata''), indifferent (''titikśu'') and composed and tranquil (''samhita''), and knows that he is adequately prepared to meet the truth face to face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living Traditions in Contemporary Contexts|author=Vasudeva Rao|publisher=Orient Blackswan|pages=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-utNEpTZWUkC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hadhyal=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7pijVJnRBMWiugSHzIDYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimāmsikas]] consider ''adhikāra'' to be a notion of appropriateness. All things and actions have identifiable ''adhikāra''. ''Adhikāra'' indicates the level of preparation necessary for making one skilled for higher gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Myths and Philosophy|publisher=SUNY Press|page=304|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XdHPgPmSgYEC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aZijVMWYIYWxuASk_ILACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''adhikāra'' also helps describe the relationship between ''[[purusha]]'' and ''[[Prakṛti|prakrti]]'' and explain the reason for activation of creative power of nature, and thus brings about the experience of the world (''darśana bhoga'') and liberation from this experience (''[[kaivalya]]''). The eagerness to know incites the obligation (''adhikāra'') to bring about realization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Release from Life, Release in Life|publisher=Peter Lang|page=138,149|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HkzZMN3HA7kC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7pijVJnRBMWiugSHzIDYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this direction the student must firstly develop '' [[Ekagrata|Ekāgratā]] '' ('one-pointed'). ''Ekagrata'' is the state of determined and continuous concentration obtained by integrating the psycho-mental flux (''sarvārthatā'' i.e. variously directed, discontinuous, diffused attention) which is – योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ([[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutra]])- meaning – [[Yoga]] is suppression of psycho-mental states i.e. disappearance of all possible misconceptions. In this yogic state of ''ekagrata'' the yogi gains genuine will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Medicine Men to Muhammad|author=Mercia Eliade|publisher=Harper and Row|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sY0uH75vwW8C&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcT5UvCwIo-ThQfksIGQDw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgU%20%7d%7d%3c/ref }}&lt;/ref&gt; '' [[Upasana]] '' brings about ''ekagrata'', and ''upasana'' in its own turn is brought about by ''chitta shuddhi'' ('the purity of heart');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moksha|publisher=Sivanandaonline.org|url= http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and controls '' [[Vikṣepa|vikshepa]] '' (all forms of mental wanderings or distractions).

In [[Sanskrit grammar]], an ''adhikara'' is a 'heading rule' made belonging to it, by the accent of ''swarita'' with the object of avoiding a repeated designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Panini: His Place in Sanskrit Literature|author=Theodor Goldstucker|publisher=N.Trubner &amp; Co.|pages=47–49|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zQ0dhaI-rNAC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=adhikara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aZijVMWYIYWxuASk_ILACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikara&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

b)- ''Vishaya'' is the object of knowledge, here the subject-matter; the universal Self ([[Brahman]]) seemingly different from the individual self ([[Jiva]]).

==Implication==

In [[Hindu philosophy]], ''Anubandha chatushtaya'' is a traditional Indian rhetorical mode connected with the gain of knowledge and supreme perfection, which mode is based on four fundamental aspects of thoughts and actions working in-tandem which are – a) the proposed subject or theme, b) the intended goal and its nature, c) why for that goal is sought in the light of d) the subject opted and the anticipated apprehension of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poet Saints of India|author=Sumit Roy|publisher=Sterling Publishers|pages=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zMvlDsnEgRoC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Anubandha+chatushtaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZSjVPaOB9DUuQS204LwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anubandha%20chatushtaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krishna]] assures [[Arjuna]]:-

:परं भूयः प्रवक्ष्यामि ज्ञानानां ज्ञानमुत्तमम् |
:यज्ज्ञात्वा मुनयः सर्वे परां सिद्धिमितो गताः ||

: "I shall again speak of that highest knowledge which is superior to any other knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection."  [[Bhagavad Gita]] (XIV.1)

and thereafter, proceeds to explain how that knowledge can be gained and developed which would eventually free a ''mumukshu'' ('seeker') who due to association with the modes of nature (''prakrti'') is entangled in this material world, and therefore, explains the nature of the three '' [[guna]]s''. This particular statement is in the form of an ''Anubandha chatushtaya'' the subject-matter of which is ''Brahma Vidya'', the goal is liberation from sorrow, and ''pryojanam'' is the knowledge of Brahman which gives spontaneous release. Krishna leads Arjuna to that knowledge of the self which reveals what the subject is, what the "I" is – '' [[Tat Tvam Asi]] '', this is the relationship that helps the seeker, possessing basic qualities, to decide whether he should connect or associate with the subject-matter or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journey Through the Bhagavad Gita|author=G.K.Marballi|publisher=Lulu.com|page=489|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA489&amp;dq=Anubandha+chatushtaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZSjVPaOB9DUuQS204LwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anubandha%20chatushtaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence is one of the most common crimes among male athletes.There is an ongoing struggle among sporting leagues, governments, and viewers to address the increasing number of domestic violence incidents committed by athletes. The [[NFL]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]](NCAA), [[National Basketball Association]](NBA), and the sport of [[Boxing]] employ and promote athletes who have committed domestic violence. Most prominent are instances of domestic violence that occur by members of the [[NFL]], due largely to its immense popularity in the [[United States]].

==Background==
[[Domestic violence]] among athletes specifically occurs off the field and is most often perpetrated by collegiate and professional athletes. Women are most often the victims during these perpetrations of violence. [[American football|football]], a high contact sport, is played and watched by millions of Americans, and is at the center of the discussion surrounding domestic violence and major athletes. Scholars have worked on this phenomenon considering many variables when attempting to correlate the nature of athletes to domestic violence. Scholars (discussed below) have suggested that the violent behavior inherent in the football environment can be a potential accelerator or stimulator of domestic violence. Major sports franchises are increasingly criticized for their lack of action in regard to domestic violence.

==Football==

Domestic abuse among professional athletes is not a new problem, but it became a nationally recognized issue when [[Baltimore Ravens]] football player [[Ray Rice]] assaulted his then-fiancee, now wife, in 2014 and was only suspended from two [[NFL]] games.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt; The incident took place in elevator in a hotel, in which Rice knocks out his wife- the video was released by [[TMZ]]. Prior to the incident, the NFL’s conduct policy stated that players would be disciplined for domestic abuse offense, but gave no specifics, so the league was left scrambling to come up with an appropriate punishment for Rice.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt; After receiving a great deal of criticism for the light suspension, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell created new rules for players who abuse a partner, saying the first offense would lead to a six-game suspension without pay and a second offense would lead to being kicked out of the league for at least a year.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt;

The criminal behavior of football players has been studied more than that of other players in other sports. Because of the sport's intrinsically violent nature, one might suppose that football players are particularly prone to off-the-field violence. One of the NFL's biggest problems off the field is Domestic violence, according to Jon Shuppe from NBC News over the last 14 years there have been 87 arrests involving 80 football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuppe|first1=Jon|title=Still Playing: 12 NFL Players Have Domestic Violence Arrests|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nfl-controversy/still-playing-12-nfl-players-have-domestic-violence-arrests-n204831|accessdate=22 April 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of 252 nationally-reported criminal cases in one year that involved athletes found that about 14% (49) of the athletes involved were professional football players. This compared to about 7% (25) professional [[baseball]] players and about 6%  (twenty-one) of professional [[basketball]] and [[hockey]] players.&lt;ref name="1-BlueCollar Crimes/WhiteCollar Criminals" /&gt; While this does not draw any specific causation of the violence, the survey is at least suggestive that professional athletes who play other sports besides football also break the law in significant numbers, amounting to perhaps dozens of high-profile incidents each year.&lt;ref name="1-BlueCollar Crimes/WhiteCollar Criminals"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Hear|first1=Michael|title=Blue-Collar Crimes/White-Collar Criminals: Sentencing Elite Athletes Who Commit Violent Crimes|journal=Marquette Sports LawReview|date=2001|volume=12|issue=1|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to domestic violence among football players may be that they are [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to physical conduct because it is a part of what they do all the time.&lt;ref name="2 - Abrams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Mitch|title=Anger Management in Sports|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Teitelbaum, a Ph.D Clinical Psychologist and author of Sports Heroes, Fallen Idols and Illusions and Disillusions agrees with the previous statement by Mitch Abrams, saying, "They're (elite football players) trained to be very aggressive and somewhat violent on the field, that's the nature of the game and that’s how they become important players. And sometimes it's difficult for athletes to turn that off when they go back to their regular lives."&lt;ref name="3 - Teitelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teitelbaum|first1=Stanley|title=Athletes Who Indulge Their Dark Side|date=2009|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players are raised  in an environment where violence is used to resolve conflict. As one is raised in an environment that welcomes violence, their propensity to repeat what they've seen, or what has been done to them may increase.&lt;ref name="3 - Teitelbaum" /&gt; [[Adrian Peterson]] has said that he disciplined his son the way he was disciplined as a child, then went on to say that he will, "Never use a switch again" (in reference to accusations of disciplining his 4-year old with a whip.)&lt;ref name="4 - usatodayonswitch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelissero|first1=Tom|title=A Dad First|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/vikings/2014/11/20/adrian-peterson-roger-goodell-child-abuse-switch-minnesota-vikings/70025476/|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=USAToday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost every case, the domestic violence involves male athletes who play violent sports physically abusing wives or girlfriends.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; In 2010, starting running back [[Steve Jackson (running back)|Steve Jackson]] of the St. Louis Rams was accused of beating up his girlfriend while she was nine months pregnant with his child.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; His former girlfriend, Supriya Harris, said that Jackson “forcibly grabbed my arm, flung me against the door and repeatedly pushed me to the ground.”&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; Jackson took Harris to the hospital and told her to tell the doctors she had fallen in the shower. Ten days later, she delivered their child, but the couple separated four months later after he threatened her again.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

Yet it is not clear that athletes are any more involved in serious crime than the general population is. In a follow-up study, Blumstein and Benedict (1999) showed that 23% of the males in cities with a population of 250,000 or more are arrested for a serious crime at some point in their life. That compares with the 21.4% of NFL football players who had been arrested for something more serious than a minor crime as reported in Benedict’s earlier study (Benedict and Yaeger 1998). In fact, when Blumstein and Benedict compared NFL players with young men from similar racial backgrounds, they discovered that the arrest rates for NFL players were less than half that of the other group for crimes of domestic violence and nondomestic assaults.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

Woods brings attention to issue of [[male entitlement|Male Entitlement]], a topic that Benedict and Yaeger also shed light on. Some athletes develop a sense of entitlement as their fame grows. Whatever city they’re in, male athletes are surrounded by female groupies. The athletes often treat these women with disdain and yet are still tempted by their offers of sex. [[Wilt Chamberlain]], a former great NBA player, boasted in his autobiography that he had slept with over 20,000 women, which, if true, shows a definite degree of deviance.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

==NCAA==
A sensitive topic for many athletes is the apparent rise in violence against women among male athletes. Most men would be quick to say that they respect women and certainly don’t intend women harm. Here are some statistics from the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes on its website at ncava.org: A three-year study showed that while male student-athletes make up 3% of the population on college campuses, they account for 20% of sexual assaults and 35% of domestic assaults on college campuses.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Ronald|title=Social Issues in Sport|date=2011|isbn=9780736089821|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes commit one in three college sexual assaults. The general population has a conviction rate of 80% for sexual assaults, while the rate for athletes is only 38%.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; These statistics were gathered from 107 cases of sexual assault reported at 30 Division I schools between 1991 and 1993.&lt;ref name="6 - BenedictMcDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosset|first1=T. W.|last2=Benedict|first2=J. R.|last3=McDonald|first3=M. A.|title=Male student-athletes reported for sexual assault: A survey of campus police departments and judicial affairs offices.|journal=ournal of Sport &amp; Social Issues|date=1995|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of this study say the sample size was relatively small and was not controlled for the use of alcohol, the use of tobacco, and the man’s attitude toward women.&lt;ref name="7 - simmons"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simmons|first1=K|title=Sex Crimes on Campus|journal=Atlanta Journal Constitution|date=February 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those three factors are the main predictors of a male’s inclination toward gender violence. More recent studies have corroborated the study by Crosset and colleagues, and one researcher concluded that “a disproportionate number of campus gang rapes involve fraternities or athlete groups.”&lt;ref name="7 - simmons" /&gt;

Due to the rising accounts of sexual assault on college campuses, the “It’s On Us” campaign was launched in 2014 by President Barack Obama. The campaigns goal is to raise awareness of sexual assault by inspiring people to realize that it is everyone’s responsibility to do something, no matter how big or small. Over 200 universities have partnered with the “It’s On Us” campaign along with sports organizations such as the N.C.A.A. According to an article from the New York Times &lt;ref&gt;[Tracy, M. (2015, April 4). College Teams Add Assault Prevention to the Basic Drills. New York Times, p. D1(L). Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA408139956&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=uiuc_uc&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=995314d1760c4f8469e83b5843a303ab]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Big East Conference, which like the N.C.A.A. was a charter partner of ''It's on Us,'' had its lawyers brief the presidents of its 10 universities on developments in law and policy over the summer. At several universities, athletes produced public service announcements; DePaul enlisted the Chicago Police Department's Sexual Assault Task Force for athlete training, according to the conference."

==National Basketball Association==
In wake of the September media craze regarding the NFL's domestic violence issue, NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] said that his league will "take a fresh look" at its domestic violence procedures in the wake of the NFL's rash of incidents. Underscoring to the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families. "We learn from other leagues' experiences," Silver said.&lt;ref name="15 nba"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Mahoney|title=Silver: NBA will review domestic violence policies|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/|website=Nba|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We're studying everything that's been happening in the NFL. We're working with our players' association. We've been talking for several weeks and we're going to take a fresh look at everything we do." The NFL and Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] has been criticized for punishments that were too slow or lenient for [[Ray Rice]], [[Adrian Peterson]] and other players involved in issues of domestic violence brought to light in September 2014. Goodell aimed to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl. The NBA's [[collective bargaining agreement]] calls for a minimum 10-game suspension for a first offense of a player convicted of a violent felony, however nothing regarding misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Silver says that the NBA has in place, the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, but also acknowledged that it is his wish to continually revise and revisit the policy if need be.&lt;ref name="15 nba" /&gt; Silver also mentioned that "most importantly, it's education, and it's not just the players, but it's the players' families. That's what we're learning, too. We have to take these programs directly to the players' spouses, directly to their partners so that they're aware of places they can go to express concerns, whether they're anonymous hotlines, team executives, league executives. And we're consulting experts. There's a lot to be learned here. It's a societal problem; it's not one that's unique to sports."&lt;ref name="15 nba" /&gt; This proactive approach by Silver is surely helping the issue, but it does not diminish the fact that from 2010 to present, the NFL had an average arrest rate (for a population of 100,000) of approximately 2,466, followed by the NBA’s 2,157. Comparatively, professional baseball and hockey players clocked average arrest rates of 553 and 175, respectively, over the same period.&lt;ref name="14 - vocative"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Abigail|title=NFL, NBA Lead Arrest Rates Across Pro Sports|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/|website=Vocative|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boxing/Floyd Mayweather==
Neither the World Boxing Federation or the Nevada Athletics Commission have rules forbidding boxers to commit domestic violence or sexual assault.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holter|first1=Lauren|title=Boxing's Disturbing History With Domestic Violence Is Thrust Into The Spotlight By Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s Fight|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/80408-boxings-disturbing-history-with-domestic-violence-is-thrust-into-the-spotlight-by-floyd-mayweather-jrs-fight|website=Bustle|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Floyd Mayweather, Jr]], the world's highest-paid athlete&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Louisa|title=The Boxer and the Batterer|url=http://grantland.com/features/floyd-mayweather-pacquiao-domestic-violence-allegations/|website=Grantland|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is arguably the face of the sport. Floyd had been charged with domestic violence on more than one occasion, but rarely are they spoken of. Recently during the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]] fight [[ESPN]] and HBO’s [[Michelle Beadle]] and [[CNN]] reporter [[Rachel Nichols (journalist)|Rachel Nichols]], both of whom have covered Mayweather’s history of domestic violence, tweeted that Mayweather’s camp had “banned” them from the [[MGM Grand Arena]], preventing them from covering there for the respective media outlets.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; The first documented claim of domestic violence occurred in 2001. After Mayweather and Melissa Brim, the mother of his daughter Ayanna, got into an argument over child support, according to court documents, Mayweather swung open a car door that slammed her in the head, then he punched her three times in the face, leaving bruises. 
&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; In 2003, Mayweather was at a nightclub at the Luxor in Las Vegas when he spotted two friends of Josie Harris, who was the mother of three of his children. According to the testimony , Mayweather hit them both announced after following them outside the club, then. Outside, he allegedly picked up and shook a female security guard; police issued him a citation.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; A month after beating [[Arturo Gatti]] Mayweather went to trial on a felony battery charge. The previous year, Josie Harris had angrily confronted Mayweather about another woman. In response, Harris told police, he repeatedly punched her, kicked her, and dragged her by her hair, cutting her face. “My babies’ father just beat me up,” she said when she called 911.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; According to Lauren Holters article, Mayweather then, in 2010 got into another argument with mother of his children, Josie Harris, in which: punched her on the top of and in the back of the head. He allegedly kicked her, pulled her hair, and tried to break her left arm. “I’m going to get someone to pour acid on you,” he also said, according to the police report. Zion, their 9-year-old son, gave police a voluntary statement about what he saw: “He was punching her and kicking her. He was punching her in the head and he was stomping on her sholder [sic].” When Harris yelled for the children to call the police, Mayweather threatened them with violence if they did, and a friend who had come with him blocked the way, according to police. But Zion’s brother Koraun escaped, “jumped the fence,” and made his way to the main security gate, where he told the guard to call the police and an ambulance. A doctor’s examination of Harris afterward showed bruises and a concussion.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; Floyd Mayweather, who just made roughly 180 million dollars from the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]], his domestic abuse charges however, remain a quieter issue in comparison to his money or his 48-0, undefeated record.&lt;ref name="13 abc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dahlberg|first1=Tim|title=Mayweather Wins Decision in Richest Fight Ever|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/mayweather-wins-decision-richest-fight-30765218|website=Abc|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Economics==
The statistics do show that the NFL’s arrest rate for domestic violence is only half of the national average arrest rate. However, the socio-economic factor needs to be considered. While no arrest data broken down by income, BJS survey provided breakdowns for victimization rates. Benjamin Morris, the researcher and writer of FiveThirtyEight, found that the domestic violence victimization rate for people from households making $75,000 or more was 39% of the overall domestic violence victimization rate, and for women ages 20 to 34 it was less than 20%. Although it is impossible to compare directly to the relative NFL arrest rate with precision, at least it gives some benchmark to show that people with higher income levels generally tend to have lower rates of arrest for domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Benjamin|title=More On The Rate Of Domestic Violence Arrests Among NFL Players|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/more-on-the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/|website=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of domestic violence among NFL players is higher than expected for their income level, which could suggest that these athletes are indeed more prone to domestic violence.&lt;ref name="8 - Live Science"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rachel|first1=Rettner|title=Are Athletes Prone to Violence|url=http://www.livescience.com/47949-pro-athletes-domestic-violence.html|website=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3509">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], '''axiality and rhombicity''' are two characteristics of a [[symmetric tensor|symmetric]] second-rank [[tensor]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], describing its directional asymmetry. 

Let ''A'' denote a second-rank tensor in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which can be represented by a 3-by-3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. We assume that ''A'' is symmetric. This implies that ''A'' has three real [[eigenvalue]]s, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;A_{{xx}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_{{yy}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_{{zz}}&lt;/math&gt;. We assume that they are ordered such that 
:&lt;math&gt;A_{{xx}} \le A_{{yy}} \le A_{{zz}}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The axiality of ''A'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta A =2 A_{zz}-(A_{xx}+A_{yy}). \, &lt;/math&gt;
The rhombicity is the difference between the smallest and the second-smallest eigenvalue:
:&lt;math&gt; \delta A = A_{yy}-A_{xx}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Other definitions of axiality and rhombicity differ from the ones given above by constant factors which depend on the context. For example, when using them as parameters in the irreducible spherical tensor expansion, it is most convenient to divide the above definition of axiality by &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{6}}&lt;/math&gt; and that of rhombicity by &lt;math&gt;{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The description of physical interactions in terms of '''axiality and rhombicity''' is frequently encountered in [[Spin (physics)|spin]] dynamics and, in particular, in [[Spin (physics)|spin]] relaxation theory, where many traceless bilinear interaction Hamiltonians, having the (eigenframe) form

:&lt;math&gt; \hat H = \hat\vec\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat\vec\mathbf{b} = A_{xx} \hat a_{x} \hat b_{x} + A_{yy} \hat a_{y} \hat b_{y} + A_{zz} \hat a_{z} \hat b_{z} &lt;/math&gt;

(hats denote spin projection operators) may be conveniently rotated using rank 2 irreducible spherical tensor operators:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat\vec\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat\vec\mathbf{b} = \frac{\delta A}{2} \hat T_{2,-2} + \frac{\delta A}{2} \hat T_{2,2} + \frac{\Delta A}{\sqrt{6}} \hat T_{2,-2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \hat \hat R_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma} (\hat T_{l,m}) =  \sum_{k=-2}^2 \hat T_{l,k} \mathfrak{D}_{k,m}^{(l)}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{D}_{k,m}^{(l)}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; are Wigner functions, &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; are Euler angles, and the expressions for the rank 2 irreducible spherical tensor operators are:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,2} = + \frac{1}{2} \hat a_{+} \hat b_{+} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,1} = - \frac{1}{2}( \hat a_{z} \hat b_{+} + \hat a_{+} \hat b_{z} ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,0} = + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}( \hat a_{z} \hat b_{z} - \frac{1}{4}( \hat a_{+} \hat b_{-} + \hat a_{-} \hat b_{+}) ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,-1} = + \frac{1}{2}( \hat a_{z} \hat b_{-} + \hat a_{-} \hat b_{z} ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,-2} = + \frac{1}{2} \hat a_{-} \hat b_{-} &lt;/math&gt;

Defining Hamiltonian rotations in this way (axiality, rhombicity, three angles) significantly simplifies calculations, since the properties of Wigner functions are well understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1033">The '''axiom of equity''' was proposed by [[Samuel Clarke]], an English [[philosopher]], in the spirit of the [[ethic of reciprocity]].

In his book ''A Discourse Concerning the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion, and the Truth and Certainty of the Christian Revelation'', Clarke wrote: 
{{quote|Whatever I judge reasonable or unreasonable for another to do to me; that, by the same judgment, I declare reasonable or unreasonable, that I in the like case should do for him.}}

[[Hastings Rashdall]], in his 1907 book ''[[The Theory of Good and Evil]]'', restated the axiom as: 
{{quote|One man's good is of as much intrinsic worth as the like good of another.}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''band''' (also called '''idempotent semigroup''') is a [[semigroup]] in which every element is [[idempotent]] (in other words equal to its own square). Bands were first studied and named by {{harvs|first=A. H.|last=Clifford|authorlink=Alfred H. Clifford|year=1954|txt}}; the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] of bands was described independently in the early 1970s by Biryukov, Fennemore and Gerhard.&lt;ref name="bfg"/&gt; '''Semilattices''', '''left-zero bands''', '''right-zero bands''', '''rectangular bands''', '''normal bands''', '''left-regular bands''', '''right-regular bands''' and '''regular bands''', specific subclasses of bands which lie near the bottom of this lattice, are of particular interest and are briefly described below.

==Varieties of bands==
A class of bands forms a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] if it is closed under formation of subsemigroups, [[homomorphism|homomorphic images]] and [[direct product]]. Each variety of bands can be defined by a single  [[variety (universal algebra)|defining identity]].{{sfnp|Fennemore|1970}}

===Semilattices===
[[Semilattices]] are exactly [[commutative]] bands; that is, they are the bands satisfying the equation
* ''xy'' = ''yx'' for all ''x'' and ''y''.

===Zero bands===
A '''left zero band''' is a band satisfying the equation
* ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'',
whence its [[Cayley table]] has constant rows.

Symmetrically, a '''right zero band''' is one satisfying
* ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y'',
so that the Cayley table has constant columns.

===Rectangular bands===
A '''rectangular band''' is a band ''S'' that satisfies
* ''xyx'' = ''x'' for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S'',
or equivalently,
*''xyz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''xz'' for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S'',
The second characterization clearly implies the first, and conversely the first implies ''xyz = xy(zxz) = (x(yz)x)z = xz''.

There is a complete classification of rectangular bands.  Given arbitrary sets ''I'' and ''J'' one can define a semigroup operation on ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''J'' by setting

: &lt;math&gt;(i, j) \cdot (k, \ell) = (i, \ell) \, &lt;/math&gt;

The resulting semigroup is a rectangular band because 
# for any pair (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') we have (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'')&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'')
# for any two pairs (''i''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''j''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;), (''i''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''j''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) we have
:: &lt;math&gt;  (i_x, j_x) \cdot (i_y, j_y) \cdot (i_x, j_x) = (i_x, j_x)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, any rectangular band is [[isomorphic]] to one of the above form.  Left zero and right zero bands are rectangular bands, and in fact every rectangular band is isomorphic to a direct product of a left zero band and a right zero band. All rectangular bands of prime order are zero bands, either left or right. A rectangular band is said to be purely rectangular if it is not a left or right zero band.&lt;ref name="y71"&gt;{{harvtxt|Yamada|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[category theory|categorical]] language, one can say that the category of nonempty rectangular bands is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Set}_{\ne \emptyset} \times \mathrm{Set}_{\ne \emptyset}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Set}_{\ne \emptyset}&lt;/math&gt; is the category with nonempty sets as objects and functions as morphisms.  This implies that not only that every nonempty rectangular band is isomorphic to one coming from a pair of sets, but also these sets are uniquely determined up to a canonical isomorphism, and all homomorphisms between bands come from pairs of functions between sets.{{sfnp|Howie|1995}}  If the set ''I'' is empty in the above result, the rectangular band ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''J'' is independent of ''J'', and vice versa.  This is why the above result only gives an equivalence between nonempty rectangular bands and pairs of nonempty sets.

===Normal bands===
A '''normal band''' is a band ''S'' satisfying
* ''zxyz'' = ''zyxz'' for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''.
This is the same equation used to define [[medial magma]]s, and so a normal band may also be called a medial band, and normal bands are examples of medial magmas.&lt;ref name="y71"/&gt;

===Left-regular bands===

A '''left-regular band''' is a band ''S'' satisfying

* ''xyx = xy'' for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'' &amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''

If we take a semigroup and define ''a'' ≤ ''b''  if and only if ''ab = b'', we obtain a [[partial ordering]] if and only if this semigroup is a left-regular band.  Left-regular bands thus show up naturally in the study of [[Partially ordered sets|posets]].{{sfnp|Brown|2000}}

===Right-regular bands===

A '''right-regular band''' is a band ''S'' satisfying

* ''xyx = yx'' for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'' &amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''

Any right-regular band becomes a left-regular band using the opposite product.  Indeed, every variety of bands has an 'opposite' version; this gives rise to the reflection symmetry in the figure below.

===Regular bands===
A '''regular band''' is a band ''S'' satisfying
* ''zxzyz'' = ''zxyz'' for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''

===Lattice of varieties===
[[File:Bands.svg|thumb|400px|Lattice of varieties of regular bands.]]
When [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by inclusion, varieties of bands naturally form a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]], in which the meet of two varieties is their intersection and the join of two varieties is the smallest variety that contains both of them. The complete structure of this lattice is known; in particular, it is [[countability|countable]], [[complete lattice|complete]], and [[distributive lattice|distributive]].&lt;ref name="bfg"&gt;{{harvtxt|Biryukov|1970}}; {{harvtxt|Fennemore|1970}}; {{harvtxt|Gerhard|1970}}; {{harvtxt|Gerhard|Petrich|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sublattice consisting of the 13 varieties of regular bands is shown in the figure.  The varieties of left-zero bands, semilattices, and right-zero bands are the three atoms (non-trivial minimal elements) of this lattice.

Each variety of bands shown in the figure is defined by just one identity.  This is not a coincidence: in fact, ''every'' variety of bands can be defined by a single identity.&lt;ref name="bfg"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5631">'''Being-in-itself''' is the self-contained and fully realized [[Being]] of objects.  It is a term used in early 20th century [[continental philosophy]], especially in the works of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and the [[existentialism|existentialists]].

==Being-in-itself for Heidegger==
{{Main|Heideggerian terminology}}

In the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Being-in-itself is contrasted with the being of persons, which he terms [[Dasein]]. {{Harv|Heidegger|1962|p=H.27}}  "Dasein means: care of the Being of beings as such that is ecstatically disclosed in care, not only of human Being...Dasein is ''itself'' by virtue of its essential ''relation to'' Being in general." {{Harv|Heidegger |2000|p=H.31}}  Heidegger recognized the dangers inherent to talking about Being in general and particular beings, and thus devoted space in ''[[Being and Time]]'' and the ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' to an explication of the differences; often noted by translators who distinguish Being (Sein), from ''a'' being (das Seiende).  His attention to the complication is helpful for those who are looking for detailed explanation, but rarely clears the air of confusions.

Dasein is Being that is aware of, and interested in, its own Being.  Dasein is, by its nature, invested in social interaction and society.  This is because in Heidegger's metaphysical system, one of the most fundamental ways to understand Being is through relationships.  All things stand in a relation to all other things — and by virtue of his stress on Dasein's [[ontological]] distinction, things may also stand in relation to Dasein. {{Harv|Heidegger|1962|p=H.78}}  The argument for this claim draws heavily on [[Hegel|Hegel's]] great work, the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.  Essentially, Being in itself is one of Heidegger's main concerns throughout his authorship.  Despite Heidegger's interest in it, he returns — more often than not indirectly — to the subject by interrogating other concepts that simply ''invoke'' Being without explicitly acknowledging it.

In other words, whereas Heidegger calls the being of persons 'Dasein', he determines 'Being in itself' to be at the same time the most vague and general concept possible to contemplate, but also the topic of greatest interest to him as a [[philosopher]].

==Being-in-itself for Sartre==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]] --&gt;
In Sartrean existentialism, being-in-itself (''être-en-soi'') is also contrasted with the being of persons, which he describes as a combination of, or vacillation or tension between, [[being for itself|being-for-itself]] (''être-pour-soi'') and [[being for others|being-for-others]] (''I'être-pour-autrui''). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Being-in-itself refers to objects in the external world — a mode of existence that simply is. It is not conscious so it is neither active nor passive and harbors no potentiality for transcendence. This mode of being is relevant to inanimate objects, but not to humans, who Sartre says must always make a choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm "Existentialism Is a Humanism", Lecture by J.P. Sartre, 1946.]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems of human existence for Sartre is the desire to attain being-in-itself, which he describes as the desire to be [[God]] — this is a longing for full control over one's destiny and for absolute identity, only attainable by achieving full control over the destiny of all existence. The desire to be God is one of the ways people fall into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Sartre's famous depiction of a man in a café who has applied himself to a portrayal of his role as a waiter illustrates this. The waiter thinks of himself as being a waiter (as in being-in-itself), which Sartre says is impossible since he cannot be a waiter in the sense that an inkwell is an inkwell. He is primarily a man (being-for-itself), just one who happens to be functioning as a waiter – with no fixed nature or essence, who is constantly recreating himself. He is guilty of focusing on himself as being-in-itself and not being-for-itself. Sartre would say that as a human, a being-for-itself by nature, the waiter is "a being that is not what it is and it is what it is not." Therefore, the waiter who acts as if he is at his very core a waiter "is not what [he] is"- which is to say, he is not solely a waiter- and "is what [he] is not"- meaning that he is many things other than a waiter. In simply playing the part of a waiter, the man in this example is reducing himself to a "being-in-itself" and is therefore in [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].

More specifically, we are given

:''F'': ''Hotc''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → '''Set''',

and there are certain obviously necessary conditions for ''F'' to be of type ''Hom''(&amp;mdash;, ''C''), with ''C'' a pointed connected CW-complex that can be deduced from [[category theory]] alone.  The statement of the substantive part of the theorem is that these necessary conditions are then sufficient.  For technical reasons, the theorem is often stated for functors to the category of [[pointed set]]s; in other words the sets are also given a base point.

==Brown representability theorem for CW complexes==

The representability theorem for CW complexes, due to [[Edgar H. Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Brown | jstor=1970209| first1=Edgar H. | title=Cohomology theories | mr=0138104  | year=1962 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=75 | pages=467–484 | doi=10.2307/1970209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the following.  Suppose that:
# The functor ''F'' maps [[coproducts]] (i.e. [[wedge sum]]s) in ''Hotc'' to products in ''Set'': &lt;math&gt;F(\vee_\alpha X_\alpha) \cong \prod_\alpha F(X_\alpha),&lt;/math&gt;
# The functor ''F'' maps [[Mapping cylinder|homotopy pushouts]] in ''Hotc'' to [[Pullback (category theory)#Weak pullbacks|weak pullbacks]].  This is often stated as a [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence|Mayer–Vietoris]] axiom: for any CW complex ''W'' covered by two subcomplexes ''U'' and ''V'', and any elements ''u'' ∈ ''F''(''U''), ''v'' ∈ ''F''(''V'') such that ''u'' and ''v'' restrict to the same element of ''F''(''U'' ∩ ''V''), there is an element ''w'' ∈ ''F''(''W'') restricting to ''u'' and ''v'', respectively.
Then ''F'' is representable by some CW complex ''C'', that is to say there is an isomorphism 
:''F''(''Z'') &amp;cong; ''Hom''&lt;sub&gt;''Hotc''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Z'', ''C'')
for any CW complex ''Z'', which is [[Natural transformation|natural]] in ''Z'' in that for any morphism from ''Z'' to another CW complex ''Y'' the induced maps ''F''(''Y'') → ''F''(''Z'') and ''Hom''&lt;sub&gt;''Hot''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'', ''C'') → ''Hom''&lt;sub&gt;''Hot''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Z'', ''C'') are compatible with these isomorphisms.

The converse statement also holds: any functor represented by a CW complex satisfies the above two properties. This direction is an immediate consequence of basic category theory, so the deeper and more interesting part of the equivalence is the other implication.

The representing object ''C'' above can be shown to depend functorially on ''F'': any [[natural transformation]] from ''F'' to another functor satisfying the conditions of the theorem necessarily induces a map of the representing objects. This is a consequence of [[Yoneda's lemma]].

Taking ''F''(''X'') to be the [[singular cohomology]] group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'',''A'') with coefficients in a given abelian group ''A'', for fixed ''i'' &gt; 0; then the representing space for ''F'' is the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] ''K''(''A'', ''i''). This gives a means of showing the existence of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces.

==Variants==

Since the homotopy category of CW-complexes is equivalent to the localization of the category of all topological spaces at the [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s, the theorem can equivalently be stated for functors on a category defined in this way.

However, the theorem is false without the restriction to ''connected'' pointed spaces, and an analogous statement for unpointed spaces is also false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statement does, however, hold for [[spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]] instead of CW complexes.  Brown also proved a general categorical version of the representability theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Brown | first1=Edgar H. | title=Abstract homotopy theory | year=1965 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=119 | issue=1| pages=79–85 | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-119-01/S0002-9947-1965-0182970-6/ | doi=10.2307/1994231}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes both the version for pointed connected CW complexes and the version for spectra.

A version of the representability theorem in the case of [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]] is due to Amnon Neeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Neeman | first1=Amnon | title=The Grothendieck duality theorem via Bousfield's techniques and Brown representability | url=http://www.ams.org/jams/1996-9-01/S0894-0347-96-00174-9/home.html | mr=1308405  | year=1996 | journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0894-0347 | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=205–236 | doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-96-00174-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the preceding remark, it gives a criterion for a (covariant) functor ''F'': ''C'' → ''D'' between triangulated categories satisfying certain technical conditions to have a right [[adjoint functor]]. Namely, if ''C'' and ''D'' are triangulated categories with ''C'' compactly generated and ''F'' a triangulated functor commuting with arbitrary direct sums, then ''F'' is a left adjoint. Neeman has applied this to proving the [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality theorem]] in algebraic geometry.

[[Jacob Lurie]] has proved a version of the Brown representability theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Lurie | first1=Jacob | title=Higher Algebra | year=2011 | url=http://math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/higheralgebra.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013026/http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/higheralgebra.pdf | archivedate=2011-06-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the homotopy category of a pointed [[quasicategory]] with a compact set of generators which are cogroup objects in the homotopy category. For instance, this applies to the homotopy category of pointed connected CW complexes, as well as to the unbounded [[derived category]] of a Grothendieck abelian category (in view of Lurie's higher-categorical refinement of the derived category).

[[File:Catalytic triad of TEV protease.png|thumb|360px|The enzyme [[TEV protease]]{{efn|name=TEV}} contains an example of a catalytic triad of residues (red) in its [[active site]]. The triad consists of an [[aspartate]] ([[acid]]), [[histidine]] ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]) and [[serine]] ([[nucleophile]]). The [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] (black) is bound by the [[binding site]] to orient it next to the triad. {{PDB|1lvm}}]]

A '''catalytic triad''' is a set of three coordinated [[amino acid]]s that can be found in the [[active site]] of some [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA|date=Feb 19, 2013|title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|pmid=23382230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads are most commonly found in [[hydrolase]] and [[transferase]] enzymes (e.g. [[protease]]s, [[amidase]]s, [[esterase]]s, acylases, [[lipase]]s and [[β-lactamase]]s). An [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|Base]]-[[Nucleophile]] triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for [[covalent catalysis]]. The [[Amino acid|residues]] form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], forming a [[covalent]] intermediate which is then [[hydrolysed]] to release the [[Product (chemistry)|product]] and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a [[serine]] or [[cysteine]] amino acid, but occasionally [[threonine]] or even [[selenocysteine]]. The [[Protein tertiary structure|3D structure]] of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence ([[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]).&lt;ref name = "Stryer_Ch9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

As well as [[divergent evolution]] of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show some of the best examples of [[convergent evolution]].

== Function ==
Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to [[hydrolysis|split]] a substrate ([[hydrolase]]s) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ([[transferase]]s). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the [[active site]] of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. [[binding site]] and [[oxyanion hole]]) to achieve [[nucleophilic catalysis]]. These triad residues act together to make the [[nucleophile]] member highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.

===Mechanism===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the [[functional group]]s of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.

Catalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]]. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an [[oxyanion hole]] within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an [[acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. The ejection of this first [[leaving group]] is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.

The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PhD Thesis|last=Thomas|first=Shafee,|title=Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Triad mechanism.svg|1000px|General reaction mechanism of catalysed by a catalytic triad (black): [[nucleophilic substitution]] at a [[carbonyl]] substrate (red) by a second substrate (blue). First, the enzyme's nucleophile (X) attacks the carbonyl to form a covalently linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the second substrate's nucleophile (X'). If the second nucleophile is the hydroxyl of water, the result is hydrolysis, otherwise the result is [[Transferase#Reactions|group transfer]] of X'.}}

==Identity of triad members==
[[File:Triad chemical mech.png|thumb|300px|A catalytic triad charge-relay system as commonly found in proteases. The acid residue (commonly [[glutamate]] or [[aspartate]]) aligns and polarises the base (usually [[histidine]]) which activates the nucleophile (often serine or cysteine, occasionally [[threonine]]). The triad reduces the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the nucleophilic residue which then attacks the substrate. An [[oxyanion hole]] of positively charged usually backbone [[amide]]s (occasionally side-chains) stabilise charge build-up on the substrate [[transition state]].]]

===Nucleophile===
The side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive [[carbonyl]] carbon.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The 20 [[amino acid#Standard amino acids|naturally occurring biological amino acids]] do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult [[catalytic reaction]]s. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) of serine and the [[thiol]]/thiolate ion (SH/S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of cysteine.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; Alternatively, [[threonine protease]]s use the [[secondary alcohol|secondary hydroxyl]] of threonine, however due to [[steric hindrance]] of the side chain's extra [[methyl group]] such proteases use their [[N-terminal|''N''-terminal]] amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to [[Nucleophile#Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nucleophile#sulphur|sulphur]]’s extra [[d orbital]] makes it larger (by 0.4 Å)&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642"&gt;{{cite journal|last = McGrath|first = ME|author2 = Wilke, ME|author3 = Higaki, JN|author4 = Craik, CS|author5 = Fletterick, RJ|title = Crystal structures of two engineered thiol trypsins.|journal = Biochemistry|date = Nov 28, 1989|volume = 28|issue = 24|pages = 9264–70|pmid = 2611228|doi = 10.1021/bi00450a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d&lt;sub href="thiol"&gt;C-X&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub href="Nucleophile#Oxygen"&gt;X-H&lt;/sub&gt; by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (by 5 units).&lt;ref name="polgár3232"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Polgár|first = L|author2 = Asbóth, B|title = The basic difference in catalyses by serine and cysteine proteinases resides in charge stabilization in the transition state.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology|date = Aug 7, 1986|volume = 121|issue = 3|pages = 323–6|pmid = 3540454|doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="polgár3232" /&gt; in order to achieve concerted [[deprotonation]] with catalysis.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first [[tetrahedral intermediate]] as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to [[protonate]] the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S&lt;sup href="deprotonation"&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sterically]], the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier [[van der Waals radius]]&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; and if [[mutated]] to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642" /&gt;

Very rarely, the [[selenium]] atom of the uncommon amino acid [[selenocysteine]] is used as a nucleophile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The deprotonated Se&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Base===
Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad [[Chemical polarity|polarise]]s and [[deprotonate]]s the nucleophile to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; Additionally, it [[protonate]]s the first [[Product (chemistry)|product]] to aid leaving group departure.

The base is most commonly histidine since its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=G|author2=Wlodawer, A|title=Catalytic triads and their relatives.|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1998|volume=23|issue=9|pages=347–52|pmid=9787641|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-lactamase]]s such as [[TEM-1]] use a [[lysine]] residue as the base. Because lysine's p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is so high (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damblon|first=C|author2=Raquet, X |author3=Lian, LY |author4=Lamotte-Brasseur, J |author5=Fonze, E |author6=Charlier, P |author7=Roberts, GC |author8= Frère, JM |title=The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 5, 1996|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1747–52|pmid=8700829|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.5.1747|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1747D |pmc=39852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jelsch|first=C|author2=Lenfant, F |author3=Masson, JM |author4= Samama, JP |title=Beta-lactamase TEM1 of E. coli.

===Acid===
The acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9" /&gt; Two amino acids have acidic [[Amino acid#Side chains|side chains]] at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; [[Cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus}} uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} uses [[asparagine]] as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, [[hepatitis A]] virus protease{{efn|Hepatitis A virus protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C3}}}} contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.

==Examples of triads==

On the left are the nucleophile, base and acid triad members. On the right are different substrates with the cleaved bond indicated by a pair of scissors. Two different bonds in [[beta-lactam]]s can be cleaved (1 by [[penicillin acylase]] and 2 by [[beta-lactamase]]).]]

===Ser-His-Asp===
The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The triad is exemplified by [[chymotrypsin]],{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=S1}}}} a model serine protease from the [[PA clan|PA superfamily]] which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an [[oxyanion hole]] consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

The same triad has also convergently evolved in [[α/β hydrolase]]s such as some [[lipase]]s and [[esterase]]s, however [[chirality|orientation]] of the triad members is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yueru|last2=Yin|first2=Shuhui|last3=Feng|first3=Yitao|last4=Li|first4=Jie|last5=Zhou|first5=Jiahai|last6=Liu|first6=Changdong|last7=Zhu|first7=Guang|last8=Guo|first8=Zhihong|date=2014-05-30|title=Molecular Basis of the General Base Catalysis of an α/β-Hydrolase Catalytic Triad|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/289/22/15867|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=289|issue=22|pages=15867–15879|doi=10.1074/jbc.m113.535641|issn=0021-9258|pmid=24737327|pmc=4140940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauwerdink|first=Alissa|last2=Kazlauskas|first2=Romas J.|date=2015-10-02|title=How the Same Core Catalytic Machinery Catalyzes 17 Different Reactions: the Serine-Histidine-Aspartate Catalytic Triad of α/β-Hydrolase Fold Enzymes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b01539|journal=ACS Catalysis|volume=5|issue=10|pages=6153–6176|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b01539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, brain [[acetyl hydrolase]] (which has the same fold as a small [[G-protein]]) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-''Glu ''triad is used in [[acetylcholinesterase]].

===Cys-His-Asp===
The second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif.&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt; Several families of [[cysteine protease]]s use this triad set, for example TEV protease{{efn|name=TEV|TEV protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C4}}}} and [[papain]].{{efn|name=papain|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}}} The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. [[hepatitis A|hepatitis A virus]] protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain).&lt;ref name="beveridge1355"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beveridge|first=AJ|title=A theoretical study of the active sites of papain and S195C rat trypsin: implications for the low reactivity of mutant serine proteinases|journal=Protein Science|date=July 1996|volume=5|issue=7|pages=1355–65|pmid=8819168|pmc=2143470|doi=10.1002/pro.5560050714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triad is also used by some amidases, such as [[Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase|''N''-glycanase]] to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The PUB Domain Functions as a p97 Binding Module in Human Peptide ''N''-Glycanase|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 2006|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16807242|pages = 25502–25508|volume = 281|issue = 35|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M601173200|first = Mark D.|last = Allen|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Buchberger|first3 = Mark|last3 = Bycroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-His-His===
The triad of [[cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus|Cytomegalovirus protease {{MEROPS|clan=SH|fam=S21}}}} uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to &gt;10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.&lt;ref name="ekici2023"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekici|first=OD|author2=Paetzel, M |author3=Dalbey, RE |title=Unconventional serine proteases: variations on the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad configuration.|journal=Protein Science|date=December 2008|volume=17|issue=12|pages=2023–37|pmid=18824507|doi=10.1110/ps.035436.108|pmc=2590910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-Glu-Asp===
An unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases.{{efn|Seldolisin protease {{MEROPS|clan=SB|fam=53}}}} The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an [[adaptation]] to specific environments like [[acidic]] [[hot spring]]s (e.g. [[kumamolysin]]) or cell [[lysosome]] (e.g. [[tripeptidyl peptidase]]).&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

===Cys-His-Ser===
The [[Endothelium|endothelial]] protease [[VASH1|vasohibin]]{{efn|Vasohibin protease {{MEROPS|clan=CA}}|name=Vasohibin}} uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez-Pulido|first=Luis|last2=Ponting|first2=Chris P.|date=2016-05-15|title=Vasohibins: new transglutaminase-like cysteine proteases possessing a non-canonical Cys-His-Ser catalytic triad|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1441/1742608|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=32|issue=10|pages=1441–1445|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv761|issn=1367-4803|pmc=4866520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Yasufumi|last2=Sonoda|first2=Hikaru|date=2007-01-01|title=The Vasohibin Family: A Negative Regulatory System of Angiogenesis Genetically Programmed in Endothelial Cells|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/27/1/37|journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1161/01.atv.0000252062.48280.61|issn=1079-5642|pmid=17095714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Thr-Nter, Ser-Nter and Cys-Nter===
Threonine proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] protease subunit{{efn|name=Proteasome|Proteasome {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=T1}}}} and [[Glutamate N-acetyltransferase|ornithine acyltransferases]]{{efn|name=OAT|Ornithine acyltransferases {{MEROPS|clan=PE|fam=T5}}}} use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine [[primary alcohol|primary hydroxyl]].&lt;ref name="brannigan416"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannigan|first=JA|author2=Dodson, G |author3=Duggleby, HJ |author4=Moody, PC |author5=Smith, JL |author6=Tomchick, DR |author7= Murzin, AG |title=A protein catalytic framework with an ''N''-terminal nucleophile is capable of self-activation|journal=Nature|date=Nov 23, 1995|volume=378|issue=6555|pages=416–9|pmid=7477383|doi=10.1038/378416a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..416B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheng1902"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=H|author2=Grishin, NV|title=DOM-fold: a structure with crossing loops found in DmpA, ornithine acetyltransferase, and molybdenum cofactor-binding domain.|journal=Protein Science|date=July 2005|volume=14|issue=7|pages=1902–10|pmid=15937278|doi=10.1110/ps.051364905|pmc=2253344}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the ''N''-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, [[deprotonates]] the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt; Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as [[penicillin acylase]] G{{efn|Penicillin acylase G {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=S45}}}} and [[penicillin acylase]] V{{efn|Penicillin acylase V {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C59}}}} which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their ''N''-terminal amide as a base.&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

===Ser-''cis''Ser-Lys===
This unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shin|first=S|author2=Yun, YS |author3=Koo, HM |author4=Kim, YS |author5=Choi, KY |author6= Oh, BH |title=Characterization of a novel Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad in comparison with the classical Ser-His-Asp triad.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Jul 4, 2003|volume=278|issue=27|pages=24937–43|pmid=12711609|doi=10.1074/jbc.M302156200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual ''[[Cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and ''cis''-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=N.

===Sec-His-Glu===
The rare, but naturally occurring amino acid [[selenocysteine]] (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.200400276/abstract|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a [[selenium]] atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of [[thioredoxin reductase]], which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Engineered triads===
In addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, [[protein engineering]] has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toscano|first=Miguel D.|last2=Woycechowsky|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2007-04-27|title=Minimalist Active-Site Redesign: Teaching Old Enzymes New Tricks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200604205/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=46|issue=18|pages=3212–3236|doi=10.1002/anie.200604205|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.

==Divergent evolution==
The sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly [[evolutionarily conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Halabi|first = N|author2 = Rivoire, O|author3 = Leibler, S|author4 = Ranganathan, R|title = Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.|journal = Cell|date = Aug 21, 2009|volume = 138|issue = 4|pages = 774–86|pmid = 19703402|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.038|pmc=3210731}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains the core of the active site, but it is evolutionarily [[adaptation|adapted]] to serve different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How far divergent evolution goes in proteins|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X98800730|journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date = June 1998|pages = 380–387|volume = 8|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S0959-440X(98)80073-0|first = Alexey G|last = Murzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Divergent Evolution of Enzymatic Function: Mechanistically Diverse Superfamilies and Functionally Distinct Suprafamilies|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.209|journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry|date = 2001|pmid = 11395407|pages = 209–246|volume = 70|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.209|first = John A.|last = Gerlt|first2 = Patricia C.|last2 = Babbitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proteins, called [[pseudoenzyme]]s, have non-catalytic functions (e.g. regulation by inhibitory binding) and have accumulated mutations that inactivate their catalytic triad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=JM|last2=Farhan|first2=H|last3=Eyers|first3=PA|year=2017|title=Bio-Zombie: the rise of pseudoenzymes in biology|url=|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|volume=45|issue=|pages=537–544|doi=10.1042/bst20160400|pmid=28408493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction changes ===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a [[transferase]]. For example, attack by an [[acyl]] group results in an [[acyltransferase]] reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sinapoyltransferases in the light of molecular evolution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942209002970|journal = Phytochemistry|date = October 2009|pages = 1652–1662|volume = 70|series = Evolution of Metabolic Diversity|issue = 15–16|doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.07.023|first = Felix|last = Stehle|first2 = Wolfgang|last2 = Brandt|first3 = Milton T.|last3 = Stubbs|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Milkowski|first5 = Dieter|last5 = Strack|pmid=19695650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriou|first=Polytimi S.|last2=Denesyuk|first2=Alexander|last3=Takahashi|first3=Seiji|last4=Yamashita|first4=Satoshi|last5=Johnson|first5=Mark S.|last6=Nakayama|first6=Toru|last7=Denessiouk|first7=Konstantin|date=2017-10-01|title=Alpha/beta-hydrolases: A unique structural motif coordinates catalytic acid residue in 40 protein fold families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25338/abstract|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1845–1855|doi=10.1002/prot.25338|issn=1097-0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Additionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]]s, which has two active sites.{{efn|amidophosphoribosyltransferase {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C44}}}} In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a [[glutamine]] substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an [[enzyme tunnel|internal tunnel]] in the enzyme to the second active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Smith JL|title = Glutamine PRPP amidotransferase: snapshots of an enzyme in action|journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume = 8|issue = 6|pages = 686–94|date = Dec 1998|pmid = 9914248|doi = 10.1016/s0959-440x(98)80087-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Smith JL, Zaluzec EJ, Wery JP, Niu L, Switzer RL, Zalkin H, Satow Y|title = Structure of the allosteric regulatory enzyme of purine biosynthesis|journal = Science|volume = 264|issue = 5164|pages = 1427–1433|date = Jun 1994|pmid = 8197456|doi = 10.1126/science.8197456|bibcode = 1994Sci...264.1427S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease [[Protein superfamily|superfamilies]] have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same [[protein structure|fold]]) contains [[protein family|families]] that use different nucleophiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.&lt;ref name="pmid19892822"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Within protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the [[PA clan]]), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).

}}

The [[enzymology]] of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme [[Superfamily (proteins)|superfamilies]]. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different [[Protein tertiary structure|structural fold]]. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt;

=== Cysteine and serine hydrolases ===
The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the [[chymotrypsin]]{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin}} and [[subtilisin]] superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral [[C3 protease]] and [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

=== Threonine proteases ===
Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Leslie A.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Gohara|first3=David W.|last4=Vogt|first4=Austin D.|last5=Pozzi|first5=Nicola|last6=Di Cera|first6=Enrico|date=2015-02-24|title=Why Ser and Not Thr Brokers Catalysis in the Trypsin Fold|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1457–1464|doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|issn=0006-2960|pmc=4342846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it ''N''-terminus.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

Two evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different protein folds are known to use the ''N''-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold)&lt;ref name="brannigan416" /&gt; and Superfamily PE ([[acetyltransferase]]s using the DOM fold)&lt;ref name="cheng1902" /&gt; This commonality of [[active site]] structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

'''Christianity and domestic violence''' deals with the debate in Christian communities in relation to the recognition and response to [[domestic violence]], which is complicated by a culture of silence and acceptance among abuse victims. There are some Bible verses that abusers use to justify discipline of their wives.

==Abuse within marriage==
{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
[[Christianity|Christian]] groups and authorities generally condemn [[domestic violence]] as inconsistent with the general Christian duty to love others and to the scriptural relationship between husband and wife.&lt;ref name=stct&gt;Tracy, Steven. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/february/5.50.html "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' (February 2003). (Accessed January 3, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between husband and wife===

According to the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "Men who abuse often use Ephesians 5:22, taken out of context, to justify their behavior, but the passage (v. 21-33) refers to the mutual submission of husband and wife out of love for Christ. Husbands should love their wives as they love their own body, as Christ loves the Church."&lt;ref name=usccbwi/&gt;

Some Christian theologians, such as the Rev. Marie Fortune and Mary Pellauer, have raised the question of a close connection between patriarchal Christianity and domestic violence and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Child in Christian Thought|editor1-first=Marcia J. | editor1-last = Bunge | editor1-link=Marcia Bunge|pages=462|year=2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4693-9|author=Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore|chapter="Let the Children Come" Revisited: Contemporary Feminist Theologians on Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark Kroeger; Beck, James Beck (ed). (1996). ''Women, Abuse and the Bible.'' Grand Rapids: Baker.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Tracy, author of "Patriarchy and Domestic Violence" writes: "While patriarchy may not be the overarching cause of all abuse, it is an enormously significant factor, because in traditional patriarchy males have a disproportionate share of power... So while patriarchy is not the sole explanation for violence against women, we would expect that male headship would be distorted by insecure, unhealthy men to justify their domination and abuse of women."&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Steven. (2007). Patriarchy and Domestic Violence: Challenging Common Misconceptions. ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society.'' 50(3):580-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between religion and domestic violence,&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;Wilcox, William Bradford.

These included sociobiology, psychiatric disorders and patriarchy (Dutton, 1988). Dutton argued that no single factor explanation for wife assault sufficiently explained the available data and proposed instead a nested ecological theory examining interactive effects of the broader culture (macrosystem), the subculture (exosystem), the family (microsystem) and individual characteristics (ontogeny)."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A study by Dutton and Browning in the same year found that misogyny is correlated with only a minority of abusive male partners.{{refn|"Only a minority of batterers are misogynistic (Dutton and Browning, 1988), and few are violent to non-intimate women; a much larger group experiences extreme anger about intimacy."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Campbell's study in 1992 found no evidence of greater violence towards women in more patriarchal cultures.

To the contrary, some of the highest rates of violence are found in the least orthodox partnerships — dating or cohabiting lovers."|group=nb}}&lt;ref name=Correy&gt;Correy, ‘The Role Of Patriarchy In Domestic Violence’ (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Responding to Domestic Abuse,'' a report issued by the Church of England in 2006, suggests that patriarchy should be replaced rather than reinterpreted: "Following the pattern of Christ means that patterns of domination and submission are being transformed in the mutuality of love, faithful care and sharing of burdens. 'Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ'(Ephesians 5.21). Although strong patriarchal tendencies have persisted in Christianity, the example of Christ carries the seeds of their displacement by a more symmetrical and respectful model of male–female relations."&lt;ref name=ceroda&gt;The Archbishops' Council.

===Bible===
{{Main|The Bible and violence}}
[[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] are often used to justify domestic abuse, such as those that refer to male superiority and female submission. Others counter that the use of violence is a misinterpreted view of the male role.&lt;ref name=stct/&gt;  For instance, [[Eve]] (Genesis 2-3), is seen by some Christians{{Who|date=May 2016}} to be disobedient to patriarchal God and man, and to many a generalized symbol of womanhood that must be submissive and subject to discipline, while others{{Who|date=May 2016}} disagree with this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 92-3. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian domestic discipline===
A subculture known as ''Christian domestic discipline'' (CDD) promotes [[spanking]] of wives by their husbands as a form of punishment. While its advocates rely on Biblical interpretations to support the practice, advocates for victims of domestic violence describe CDD as a form of abuse and controlling behavior. Others describe the practice as a simple [[sexual fetish]] and an outlet for [[sadomasochistic]] desires.&lt;ref name="Zadrozny"&gt;{{cite news |author=Zadrozny, Brandy |date=19 June 2013  |work=The Daily Beast |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/19/spanking-for-jesus-inside-the-unholy-world-of-christian-domestic-discipline.html |title=Spanking for Jesus: Inside the Unholy World of ‘Christian Domestic Discipline’}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christan-conservative radio host [[Bryan Fischer]] said to the ''Huffington Post'' that it was a "horrifying trend{{snd}}bizarre, twisted, unbiblical and un-Christian"&lt;ref name="Bennett-Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/christian-domestic-discipline-spanking-jesus-marriage_n_3479646 |title=Christian Domestic Discipline Promotes Spanking Wives To Maintain Biblical Marriage |work=Huffpost |date=21 June 2013 |author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to abuse===
There are a variety of responses by Christian leaders to how victims should handle abuse:
* Marjorie Proctor-Smith in "Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook" states that domestic [[physical abuse|physical]], [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexual]] violence is a [[sin]].  It victimizes family members dependent on a man and violates trust needed for healthy, equitable and cooperative relationships.  She finds that domestic violence is symptom of [[sexism]], a social sin.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 428-9. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] said in 2002, "As pastors of the Catholic Church in the United States, we state as clearly and strongly as we can that violence against women, inside or outside the home, is never justified."&lt;ref name=usccbwi&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/laity/help.shtml "When I Call for Help: A Pastoral Response to Domestic Violence Against Women"]. [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (November 12, 2002). {{ISBN|1-57455-509-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Church of England's report, ''Responding to Domestic Abuse'' advises that Christian pastors and counselors should not advise victims to make forgiving the perpetrator the top priority "when the welfare and safety of the person being abused are at stake."&lt;ref name=ceroda/&gt;
* Significant numbers of Christian [[pastor]]s ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and  would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday"&gt;Alsdurf, James and Alsdurf, Phyllis, ''Battered into Submission'', Wipf and Stock, 1998, as cited in Tracy, Steven, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=8902 "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', February 2003, accessed January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One mid-1980s survey of 5,700 pastors found that 26 percent of pastors ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and that 71 percent of pastors would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grady, J. Lee [http://www.newmanmag.com/display.php?id=818 "Control Freaks, and the Women Who Love Them"]. ''[[New Man (Christian magazine)|New Man]]'' magazine (Jan/Feb 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to the disparity of responses to abuse is lack of training, many Christian seminaries had not educated future church leaders about how to manage violence against women.  Once pastors began receiving training, and announced their participation in domestic violence educational programs, they immediately began receiving visits from women church members who had been subject to violence.  The first Theological Education and Domestic Violence Conference, sponsored by the Center for the Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence, was held in 1985 to identify topics that should be covered in seminaries.  First, church leaders will encounter sexual and domestic violence and they need to know what community resources are available.  Secondly, they need to focus on ending the violence, rather than on keeping families together.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 10. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American religious news-magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' has published articles lamenting U.S. churches for possibly making domestic abuse worse "not in incidence, but in response" due to inadequate understandings. In December 2017, academic [[W. Bradford Wilcox]] wrote for the publication, "Domestic violence is still present in church-going homes... some local churches, clergy, and counselors fail to address abuse head-on for fear of breaking up a marriage." He also argued, "Others steer clear of addressing the topic from the pulpit or in adult education for fear of broaching an uncomfortable subject. This silence around domestic violence has to end."&lt;ref name="Wilcox"&gt;https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/december-web-only/evangelicals-domestic-violence-christian-men-domestic-abuse.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into incidences of domestic violence==
In the 1970s, when multiple programs were initiated to train church leaders about domestic violence, the response "''But no one ever comes to me with this problem''" often came up to frustrate efforts. Church leaders frequently believed that if no one reached out for assistance within their congregations that there was no problem for them to deal with; however, women often withheld discussing their problems over concern that it would not be handled appropriately.  [[Ordination of women|When women increasingly became pastors]] over the 20th century, many of them found that much of their time became devoted to handling domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women; "crisis intervention" became a vital topic for them.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 9, 428. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[List of regions of the United States|regions of the United States]], research has speculated that local societies with a general [[Culture of violence theory|culture of violence]] and low [[socio-economic status]], which may also be at least nominally religious, are more likely to produce abusive men. The role of working-class [[Scots-Irish American]] culture in areas such as [[Appalachia]] is cited.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

Differing viewpoints between husband and wife may be an aggravating factor in terms of abuse, particularly when women hold beliefs in contrast to more ideologically hardline men.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16488">'''Chronostasis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] χρόνος, chrónos, "time" and στάσις, stásis, "standing") is a type of [[time perception|temporal illusion]] in which the first impression following the introduction of a new event or task-demand to the brain can appear to be extended in time.&lt;ref name="Hodinott"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chronostasis temporarily occurs when fixating on a target stimulus, immediately following a [[saccade]] (i.e., quick [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]). This elicits an overestimation in the temporal duration for which that target stimulus (i.e., postsaccadic stimulus) was perceived.  This effect can extend apparent durations by up to 500 ms and is consistent with the idea that the visual system models events prior to perception.&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Whiteley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yarrow|first=Kielan|author2=Whiteley, Louise |author3=Rothwell, John C. |author4= Haggard, Patrick |title=Spatial consequences of bridging the saccadic gap|journal=Vision Research|date=February 2006|volume=46|issue=4|pages=545–555|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2005.04.019 |pmid=16005489 |pmc=1343538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common occurrence of this illusion is known as the '''stopped-clock illusion''', where the second hand of an analog clock appears to stay still for longer than normal when looking at it for the first time.&lt;ref name=Knoll2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knoll|first=Jonas|author2=Morrone, M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

This illusion can also occur in the auditory and tactile domain. For instance, a study suggests that when someone listens to a ringing tone through a [[telephone]], while repetitively switching the receiver from one ear to the other, it causes the caller to overestimate the temporal duration between rings.&lt;ref name="Hodinott" /&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Overall, chronostasis occurs as a result of a disconnection in the communication between visual [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] and [[visual perception|perception]].  Sensation, information collected from our eyes, is usually directly interpreted to create our perception.  This perception is the collection of information that we consciously interpret from visual information.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=E. Bruce|title=Sensation and perception|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0495601494|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, quick eye movements known as [[saccade]]s disrupt this flow of information. Because research into the neurology associated with visual processing is ongoing, there is renewed debate regarding the exact timing of changes in perception that lead to chronostasis.&lt;ref name=Knoll&gt;{{cite web|last=Knoll|first=Jonas|title=Spatio-temporal representations during eye movements and their neuronal correlates|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2012/0935|format=Dissertation|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, below is a description of the general series of events that lead to chronostasis, using the example of a student looking up from his desk toward a clock in the classroom.

#The eyes receive information from the environment regarding one particular focus.  This sensory input is sent directly to the [[visual cortex]] to be processed.  After [[visual perception|visual processing]], we consciously perceive this object of focus.&lt;ref name=Kolb&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=Bryan|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0716795868|pages=350–375|edition=6th|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the context of a student in a classroom, the student's eyes focus on a paper on their desk.  After his eyes collect light reflected off of the paper and this information is processed in his visual cortex, the student consciously perceives the paper in front of him.
#Following either a conscious decision or an involuntary perception of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] in the periphery of the [[visual field]], the eyes intend to move to a second target of interest.&lt;ref name=Ibbotson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=M.

J. |title=Saccadic Modulation of Neural Responses: Possible Roles in Saccadic Suppression, Enhancement, and Time Compression|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=October 2008|volume=28|issue=43|pages=10952–10960|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3950-08.2008|pmid=18945903}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the student described above, this may occur as he decides that he wishes to check the clock at the front of the classroom.
#The muscles of the eye contract and it begins to quickly move towards the second object of interest through an action known as a saccade.&lt;ref name=Purves&gt;{{cite book|last=Purves|first=Dale|title=Neuroscience|year=2012|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87893-695-3|edition=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As soon as this saccade begins, a signal is sent from the eye back to the brain.  This signal, known as an efferent cortical trigger or [[efference copy]], communicates to the brain that a saccade is about to begin.&lt;ref name=Yarrow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yarrow|first=Kielan|author2=Johnson, Helen |author3=Haggard, Patrick |author4= Rothwell, John C. |title=Consistent Chronostasis Effects across Saccade Categories Imply a Subcortical Efferent Trigger|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=June 2004|volume=16|issue=5|pages=839–847|doi=10.1162/089892904970780 |pmid=15200711 |pmc=1266050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bridgeman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridgeman|first=Bruce|title=A review of the role of efference copy in sensory and oculomotor control systems|journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering|year=1995|volume=23|issue=4|pages=409–422|doi=10.1007/BF02584441}}&lt;/ref&gt; During saccades, the sensitivity of visual information collected by the eyes is greatly reduced and, thus, any image collected during this saccade is very blurry.&lt;ref name=Knoll /&gt; In order to prevent the visual cortex from processing blurred sensory information, visual information collected by the eyes during a saccade is suppressed through a process known as [[saccadic masking]].  This is also the same mechanism used to prevent the experience of [[motion blur]].&lt;ref name=Thilo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thilo|first=Kai V.|author2=Walsh, Vincent|title=Vision: When The Clock Appears to Stop|journal=Current Biology|date=19 February 2002|volume=12|pages=R135-R137|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00707-8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Following the completion of the saccade, the eyes now focus on the second object of interest.  As soon as the saccade concludes, another efferent cortical trigger is sent from the eyes back to the brain.  This signal communicates to the brain that the saccade has concluded.  Prompted by this signal, the visual cortex once again resumes processing visual information.&lt;ref name=Yarrow /&gt; For the student, his eyes have now reached the clock and his brain's visual cortex begins to process information from his eyes.  However, this second efferent trigger also communicates to the brain that a period of time has been missing from perception.  To fill this gap in perception, visual information is processed in a manner known as neural antedating or backdating.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt; In this visual processing, the gap in perception is “filled in” with information gathered after the saccade.  For the student, the gap of time that occurred during the saccade is substituted with the processed image of the clock.  Thus, immediately following the saccade, the second hand of the clock appears to stop in place before moving.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M|title=Human time perception and its illusions|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=April 2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=131–136|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.06.002|pmid=18639634|pmc=2866156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChronostasisTimeline.gif|thumb|center|400px|A timeline of the sensation and perception of chronostasis within the context of a student in a classroom.  This depicts the mechanism of action described above.]]

In studying chronostasis and its underlying causes, there is potential bias in the experimental setting.  In many experiments, participants are asked to perform some sort of task corresponding to sensory stimuli.  This could cause the participants to anticipate stimuli, thus leading to bias.  Also, many mechanisms involved in chronostasis are complex and difficult to measure.  It is difficult for experimenters to observe the perceptive experiences of participants without "being inside their mind."&lt;ref name=Hodinott /&gt; Furthermore, experimenters normally do not have access to the neural circuitry and neurotransmitters located inside the braincases of their subjects.

==Modulating factors==
Because of its complexity, there are various characteristics of stimuli and physiological actions that can alter the way one experiences chronostasis.

===Saccadic amplitude===
The greater the amplitude (or duration) of a saccade, the more severe the resulting overestimation.  The further the student in the above example's eyes must travel in order to reach the clock, the more dramatic his perception of chronostasis.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt;  This connection supports the assertion that overestimation occurs in order to fill in the length of time omitted by [[saccadic masking]].  This would mean that, if the saccade lasted for a longer period of time, there would be more time that needed to be filled in with overestimation.&lt;ref name=Nobre&gt;{{cite book|last=Nobre|first=Anna C.|title=Attention and time|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956345-6|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention redirection===
When shifting focus from one object to a second object, the saccadic movement of one's eyes is also accompanied by a conscious shift of [[attention]].  In the context of the stopped clock illusion, not only do your eyes move, but you also shift your attention to the clock.  This led researchers to question whether the movement of the eyes or simply the shift of the observer's attention towards the second stimulus initiated saccadic masking.  Experiments in which subjects diverted only their attention without moving their eyes revealed that the redirection of attention alone was not enough to initiate chronostasis.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt;  This suggests that attention is not the time marker used when perception is filled back in.  Rather, the physical movement of the eyes themselves serves as this critical marker.  However, this relationship between attention and perception in the context of chronostasis is often difficult to measure and may be biased in a laboratory setting.  Because subjects may be biased as they are instructed to perform actions or to redirect their attention, the concept of attention serving as a critical time marker for chronostasis may not be entirely dismissed.&lt;ref name=Nobre /&gt;

===Spatial continuity===
Following investigation, one may wonder if chronostasis still occurs if the saccadic target is moving.  In other words, would you still experience chronostasis if the clock you looked at were moving?  Through experimentation, researchers found that the occurrence of chronostasis in the presence of a moving stimulus was dependent on the awareness of the subject.  If the subject were aware that the saccadic target was moving, they would not experience chronostasis.  Conversely, if the subject were not aware of the saccadic target's movement, they did experience chronostasis.  This is likely because antedating does not occur in the case of a consciously moving target.  If, after the saccade, the eye correctly falls on the target, the brain assumes this target has been at this location throughout the saccade.  If the target changes position during the saccade, the interruption of spatial continuity makes the target appear novel.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt;

===Stimulus properties===
Properties of stimuli themselves have shown to have significant effects on the occurrence of chronostasis.  In particular, the frequency and pattern of stimuli affect the observer's perception of chronostasis.  In regard to frequency, the occurrence of many, similar events can exaggerate duration overestimation and makes the effects of chronostasis more severe.  In regard to repetition, repetitive stimuli appear to be of shorter subjective duration than novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=Eagleman /&gt; This is due to neural suppression within the cortex.  Investigation using various imaging techniques has shown that repetitive firing of the same cortical neurons cause them to be suppressed over time.&lt;ref name=Verhoef&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhoef|first=B.-E.|author2=Kayaert, G. |author3=Franko, E. |author4=Vangeneugden, J. |author5= Vogels, R. |title=Stimulus Similarity-Contingent Neural Adaptation Can Be Time and Cortical Area Dependent|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 October 2008|volume=28|issue=42|pages=10631–10640|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3333-08.2008 |pmid=18923039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurs as a form of [[neural adaptation]].

===Sensory domain===
The occurrence of chronostasis extends beyond the visual domain into the [[Auditory system|auditory]] and [[Touch|tactile]] domains.&lt;ref name=Nijhawan&gt;{{cite book|last=Nijhawan|first=Romi|title=Space and Time in Perception and Action|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-86318-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the auditory domain, chronostasis and duration overestimation occur when observing auditory stimuli.  One common example is a frequent occurrence when making telephone calls.  If, while listening to the phone's dial tone, research subjects move the phone from one ear to the other, the length of time between rings appears longer.&lt;ref name=Hodinott /&gt; In the tactile domain, chronostasis has persisted in research subjects as they reach for and grasp objects.  After grasping a new object, subjects overestimate the time in which their hand has been in contact with this object.&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Rothwell" /&gt;  In other experiments, subjects turning a light on with a button were conditioned to experience the light before the button press. This suggests that, much in the same way subjects overestimate the duration of the second hand as they watch it, they may also overestimate the duration of auditory and tactile stimuli.  This has led researchers to investigate the possibility that a common timing mechanism or temporal duration scheme is used for [[time perception|temporal perception]] of stimuli across a variety of sensory domains.&lt;ref name=Eagleman /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">'''Computational irreducibility''' is one of the main ideas proposed by [[Stephen Wolfram]] in his book ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''.

==The idea==
Wolfram terms the inability to shortcut a program (e.g., a [[system]]), or otherwise describe its behavior in a simple way, "computational irreducibility". The [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]] is that the world of simple programs contains a great diversity of [[behavior]], but, because of [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], it is impossible to [[predict]] what they will do before essentially running them. The idea demonstrates that there are occurrences where theory's predictions are effectively not possible. Wolfram states several [[phenomena]] are normally computationally irreducible.

Computational irreducibility explains observed limitations of existing mainstream science. In cases of computational irreducibility, only observation and experiment can be used. Computational irreducibility may also provide a scientifically-based resolution for [[free will]].

==Implications==

* There is no easy theory for any behavior that seems [[Complexity|complex]].
* Complex behavior features can be captured with models that have simple underlying structures.
* An overall system's behavior based on simple structures can still exhibit behavior indescribable by reasonably "simple" laws.

==Analysis==

Israeli and Goldenfeld found that some less complex systems behaved simply and predictably (thus, they allowed [[approximation]]s). However, more complex systems were still computationally irreducible and unpredictable. It is unknown what conditions would allow complex phenomena to be described simply and predictably.

{{Sociology}}
'''Discourse''' (from [[Latin]] ''discursus'', "running to and from") denotes written and spoken [[communication]]s:

* In [[semantics]] and [[discourse analysis]]: Discourse is a conceptual generalization of [[conversation]] within each modality and context of communication.
* The totality of codified language (vocabulary) used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice, such as legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Larry|date=June 2001|publisher=revue-texto.net|accessdate=25 May 2011|title=A Little Glossary of Semantics|url=http://www.revue-texto.net/Reperes/Glossaires/Glossaire_en.html#discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the work of [[Michel Foucault]], and that of the social theoreticians he inspired: ''discourse'' describes "an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (''énoncés'')", statements in conversation.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969&gt;{{Cite book| author = M. Foucault| year = 1969| title = [[The Archaeology of Knowledge|L'Archéologie du savoir]]| location = Paris| publisher = Éditions Gallimard| authorlink = M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discourse, an "enouncement" (statement) is not a unit of [[semiotic]] signs, but an abstract construct that allows the semiotic signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969 /&gt; Therefore, a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences (relations among signs that communicate meaning) between and among objects, subjects, and statements.

The term "discursive formation" ({{lang-fr|formation discursive}}) conceptually describes the regular communications (written and spoken) that produce such discourses, such as informal conversations. As a philosopher, Michel Foucault applied the discursive formation in the analyses of large bodies of knowledge, such as [[political economy]] and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=Foucault1970&gt;{{Cite book|author= M. Foucault|title=[[The Order of Things]]|year=1970|orig-year=1966| publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]|isbn= 0-415-26737-4|authorlink= M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Compact Oxford Dictionary, Thesaurus and Wordpower Guide'' (2001). Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first sense-usage (semantics and discourse analysis), the term ''discourse'' is studied in [[corpus linguistics]], the [[study of language]] expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (samples) of "real world" text. In the second sense (the codified language of a field of enquiry) and in the third sense (a statement, ''un énoncé''), the analysis of a ''discourse'' examines and determines the connections among [[language]] and [[structure and agency]].

Moreover, because a discourse is a body of text meant to communicate specific data, information, and knowledge, there exist internal relations in the content of a given discourse; likewise, there exist external relations among discourses. As such, a discourse does not exist ''per se'' (in itself), but is related to other discourses, by way of inter-discursivity. Discourses are also perpetually differentiating toward each other in time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=section on inter-discursivity, chapter 10 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-80-246-3470-8|location=Prague|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meeting the Universe halfway: Quantum physics and entanglement of matter and meaning|last=Barad, K.|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, in the course of [[Research|intellectual enquiry]], the discourse among researchers features the questions and answers of ''What is ...?'' and ''What is not. ...'', conducted according to the meanings (denotation and connotation) of the concepts (statements) used in the given field of enquiry, such as [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[sociology]]; [[cultural studies]] and [[literary theory]]; the [[philosophy of science]] and [[feminism]].

==The humanities==
In the [[humanities]] and in the [[social science]]s, the term ''discourse'' describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language; the discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic.

Discourse can affect the person's perspective; it is impossible to avoid discourse for any subject. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various [[guerrilla]] movements describing them either as "[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]" or "[[terrorists]]". In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions and perhaps also the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] needed to communicate.

Discourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and metagenres that constrain and enable them. That is language talking about language, for instance the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSMIV]] manual tells which terms have to be used in talking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of the professionals of psychology and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine F. Schryer and Philippa Spoel. Genre Theory, Health-Care Discourse, and Professional Identity Formation. Journal of Business and Technical Communication 2005. 19: 249  http://jbt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/249&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse is closely linked to different theories of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[State (polity)|state]], at least as long as defining discourses is seen to mean defining reality itself. This conception of discourse is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault.

== Formal semantics ==
A [[discourse representation theory]] describes the [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] of a sentence using [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Muskens, Reinhard. "[https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/180683/COMBININ.PDF Combining Montague semantics and discourse representation]." Linguistics and philosophy 19.2 (1996): 143-186.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Modernism ==

Modern theorists were focused on achieving progress and believed in the existence of natural and social laws which could be used universally to develop knowledge and thus a better understanding of society.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal
| author = J. Larrain
| year = 1994
| title = Ideology and cultural identity: Modernity and the third world presence
| location = Cambridge
| publisher = [[Polity Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists were preoccupied with obtaining the truth and reality and sought to develop theories which contained certainty and predictability.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"&gt;{{Cite book
| author = [[Steven Best]] &amp; [[Douglas Kellner]]
| year = 1997
| title = The postmodern turn
| publisher = [[The Guilford Press]]
| isbn = 1-57230-221-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists therefore viewed discourse as being relative to talking or way of talking and understood discourse to be functional.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"&gt;Strega, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more "accurate" words to describe new discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; In modern times, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as "natural" products of common sense usage or progress.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; [[Modernism]] further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.&lt;ref&gt;Regnier, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuralism ==

[[Structuralism|Structuralist]] theorists, such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], argue that all human actions and social formations are related to [[language]] and can be understood as systems of related elements.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"&gt;{{Cite book
| author = D. Howarth
| year = 2000
| title = Discourse
| location = Philadelphia, Pa.
| publisher = [[Open University Press]]
| isbn = 0-335-20070-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the "…individual elements of a system only have significance when considered in relation to the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| author = D. Howarth
| year = 2000
| title = Discourse
| location = Philadelphia, Pa.
| publisher = [[Open University Press]]
| isbn = 0-335-20070-2
| page =17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has made an important contribution to our understanding of language and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Aaron. ''Discourse and Difference'' "University of New Hampshire Cosmology Seminar" [http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2002/summary3_2002.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Course in General Linguistics|Saussure's theory of language]] highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"/&gt;

== Postmodernism ==

Following the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged [[postmodernism|postmodern]] theory.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"/&gt; Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"/&gt; Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experience of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and common experiences.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

In contrast to modern theory, postmodern theory is more fluid and allows for individual differences as it rejected the notion of social laws. Postmodern theorists shifted away from truth seeking and instead sought answers for how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge is plural, contextual, and historically produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers therefore embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

French social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] developed a notion of discourse in his early work, especially the ''[[Archaeology of knowledge]]'' (1972). In ''Discursive Struggles Within Social Welfare: Restaging Teen Motherhood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283&amp;ndash;298 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault's definition of discourse as "systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak." Foucault traces the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimating and power, emphasizing the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault later theorized that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Foucault (1977, 1980) argued that power and knowledge are inter-related and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power.&lt;ref&gt;Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–1977. M Foucault. ''Selected interviews and other writings'' 1972, 1977, 1980. [[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault further stated that power is always present and can both produce and constrain the truth.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Discourse according to Foucault (1977, 1980, 2003) is related to power as it operates by rules of exclusion. Discourse therefore is controlled by objects, what can be spoken of; ritual, where and how one may speak; and the privileged, who may speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| author = M. Foucault
| year = 1972

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coining the phrases [[power-knowledge]] Foucault (1980) stated knowledge was both the creator of power and creation of power.  An object becomes a "node within a network."  In his work, ''The Archaeology of Knowledge,'' Foucault uses the example of a book to illustrate a node within a network.  A book is not made up of individual words on a page, each of which has meaning, but rather "is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences."  The meaning of that book is connected to a larger, overarching web of knowledge and ideas to which it relates.

One of the key discourses that Foucault identified as part of his critique of power-knowledge was that of [[neoliberalism]], which he related very closely to his conceptualization of [[governmentality]] in his lectures on biopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (2008) ''The Birth Of Biopolitics: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1978–1979''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; This trajectory of Foucault's thinking has been taken up widely within [[Human Geography]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29141">'''Documentality''' is the theory of documents that underlies the [[ontology]] of [[social reality]] put forward by the Italian [[philosopher]] [[Maurizio Ferraris]] (see Ferraris 2007, 2008, 2009a and 2009b).&lt;ref&gt;For an extended debate on the theory, see [http://www.rescogitans.it/main.php?issueid=7&amp;sectionid=5&amp;chapterid=21 Rescogitans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321204218/http://www.rescogitans.it/main.php?issueid=7&amp;sectionid=5&amp;chapterid=21 |date=March 21, 2012 }} and the symposium devoted to the theory in [http://www2.units.it/etica/ ''Etica &amp; Politica'' 11/2 (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory gives to documents a central position within the sphere of social [[object (philosophy)|objects]], conceived as distinct from physical and ideal objects. Ferraris argues that social objects are "social acts that have been inscribed on some kind of support", be it a paper document, a magnetic support, or even memory in people's heads (e.g. in the case of the [[promise]]s we make every day). Thus the constitutive [[norm (philosophy)|rule]] of social objects is that ''Object = Inscribed Act''. Therefore, documents as inscriptions possessing social relevance and [[value (ethics)|value]] embody the essential and prototypical features of any social object, and it is on this basis that it is possible to develop an ontology capable of classifying documents and their selective storage, beginning with the grand divide between strong documents (inscriptions of acts), which make up social objects in the full sense, and weak documents (recordings of facts), which are secondary derivatives and of lesser importance. This theory is inspired, on the one hand, by the reflection on the centrality of writing developed by [[Jacques Derrida]] (1967, 1972) and, on the other hand, by the theory of social acts devised by [[Adolf Reinach]] (1913) and the theory of linguistic acts by [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] (1962).

For a critical comparison between the social ontology put forward by Searle and Documentality, see Casetta 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed by the American philosopher [[John Searle|John R. Searle]], in particular in his book ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (1995). [[John Searle|Searle]]'s ontology recognizes the sphere of social objects, defining them as higher order objects with respect to [[physical objects]], in accordance with the rule
&lt;blockquote&gt;''X counts as Y in C''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

meaning that the physical object X, for instance a colored piece of paper, counts as Y, a 10 [[euro]] [[banknote]], in context C, the [[Europe]] of the year 2010. According to [[John Searle|Searle]], from the iteration of this simple rule the whole complexity of social reality is derived.

Powerful it may be, the theory runs&amp;nbsp;– according to Ferraris&amp;nbsp;– into problems. Firstly, it is not at all obvious how, from the physical object, we manage to get to the social object. If any physical object really can constitute the origin of a social object, then it is not clear what would prevent ''every'' physical object to turn into a social object. But clearly it is not the case that, for instance, if you decide to draw a banknote, you thereby produce a banknote.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei? Ontologia del telefonino'', Milano, Bompiani, 2005: pp. 225-228 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità. Perché è necessario lasciar tracce'', Roma-Bari, Laterza, 2009: pp. 170-173.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard theory relies on key notion of "collective [[intentionality]]" to explain the transfiguration of X in Y. However, such a notion&amp;nbsp;– as Ferraris argues&amp;nbsp;– is not at all as clear as it purports to be.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: pp. 214-225 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 163-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, how does the reversibility from the social to the physical sphere work? It is fairly intuitive to assert that a banknote is also a piece of paper, or that a President is also a person. As much as it is true that when [[John Searle|Searle]] is alone in a hotel room there is only one physical object, but many social objects (a husband, an employee of the state of California, an American citizen, a driving license holder etc.). In this case, the passage back from Y (the social) to X (the physical) goes smoothly. However, things change in different, although not very peculiar, situations. How should we deal with [[vagueness|vague]] or vast entities, such as a State, a battle, a university? And how about negative entities, such as debts?&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: pp. 229-233 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 173-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The roots of documentality==
Three philosophical theses&amp;nbsp;– inspired, respectively, by the work of the German [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Adolf Reinach]], the Peruvian [[economist]] [[Hernando de Soto Polar|Hernando de Soto]], and the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]&amp;nbsp;– shape the theory of Documentality.

===The speech acts thesis===
According to the Speech Act Thesis&amp;nbsp;– stemming more from the theory of social acts devised in 1913 by the German phenomenologist [[Adolf Reinach]] than from the writings of [[J. L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. K. Mulligan (ed.), ''Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology'', Dordrecht, Martinus Nijhoff, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– through the performance of speech acts (acts of promising, marrying, accusing, baptizing) we change the world by bringing into being [[claim (legal)|claims]], [[obligation]]s, [[rights]], relations of authority, debts, permissions, names, and a variety of other sorts of entities, thus making up the ontology of the social world. Given that speech acts are evanescent, the physical basis for the temporally extended existence of its products are&amp;nbsp;– in small societies and in simple social interactions&amp;nbsp;– memory traces and other psychological features of the people involved in these acts; and&amp;nbsp;– in large societies and in more complex social interactions&amp;nbsp;– documents. Documents are the physical entities, which create and sustain the sorts of enduring and re-usable [[deontological ethics|deontic]] powers that extend human memory, and thereby create and sustain the new and more complex forms of social order, which are characteristic of modern civilization.

===The "de Soto thesis"===
According to a thesis rooted in the works of [[Hernando de Soto Polar|de Soto]] (2000) (see also Smith 2003, 2008), economic development can be boosted by a documental development. Through the performance of document acts (acts of filling in, registering, conveying, validating, attaching), we ''change the world'' by bringing into being [[ownership]] relations, legal [[accountability]], business organizations, and a variety of other institutional orders of modern societies. As stock and share certificates ''create'' [[capital (economics)|capital]], so statutes of incorporation ''create'' [[company|companies]]. As identity documents ''create'' identities (the sorts of things which can be the objects of an [[identity theft]]), so diplomas ''create'' academic ranks. Where for [[Hernando de Soto Polar|de Soto]], it is commercial paper documents which create what he calls the "invisible infrastructure of asset management [...] upon which the astonishing fecundity of Western capitalism rests" Ferraris goes further and asserts that documents, both in paper and in electronic form, create the invisible infrastructure of contemporary social reality.

===The "Derrida thesis"===
[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] (1967) elaborated a philosophy of writing that finds its most correct application in the social sphere. Concerning speech acts, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] (1972) observes that they are mostly inscribed acts, since without records of some sort the [[performative utterance|performatives]] would not produce social objects such as conferences, marriages, graduation ceremonies, or constitutions. The point is simple, if we imagine a graduation or a wedding ceremony in which there are no registers and testimonies, it is difficult to maintain that a husband, a wife, or a graduate has been produced. This amounts to saying that social objects turn out to be (as much as the ideal ones) closely linked to the forms of their inscription and recording. However, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] was wrong&amp;nbsp;– according to Ferraris (2005; 2009)&amp;nbsp;– in claiming that "nothing exists outside the text".&lt;ref&gt;J. Derrida, ''De la grammatologie'', Paris, Ed. de Minuit, 1967: pp. 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually physical and ideal objects exist independently from every recording, as independently from there being humanity. This is not the case for social objects, which depend closely on records and the existence of humanity. It is in this sense that, by weakening [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s thesis, Ferraris proposed to develop a social ontology starting from the intuition that nothing ''social'' exists outside the text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: pp. 202-204, 236-242 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, Ferraris advances an innovative approach to social ontology called Documentality.

==Context and history==
The most influential ontology of social reality, formulated by the American philosopher John Searle (1995), is based on collective intentionality, which allegedly ensures that certain physical objects (e.g. a piece of paper) are transformed into social objects (e.g. a banknote). As noted by Barry Smith (2003), this perspective has difficulty in accounting for both negative entities – such as debts, which apparently do not have a physical counterpart – and the new, seemingly intangible, social objects generated by the Web. The theory of documentality proposed by Maurizio Ferraris (2005) aims to solve these problems by arguing that social objects are always recordings of social acts. This accounts for both negative entities and the virtual entities of the web, which consist precisely of recordings just like any other social object. For the theory of documentality, the constitutive rule of social reality is "Object = Inscribed Act", where "inscribed" is equal to "recorded". That is: a social object is the result of a social act (such as to involve at least two people), which is characterized by its being recorded on some support, including the minds of the people involved in the act (in the case of informal social acts such as promises) . Articulated by Ferraris (2009) in a complete ontological theory and by Smith ( 2012) in a theory of document acts, documentality has three main reasons of interest. First, it has been able to account for the substantial growth of documents and recording devices in the Web world, which is very well explained by the proposed constitutive law of social reality. Secondly, it has been able to explain why social reality, while requiring the presence of subjects for the enactment of acts, may develop independently from them and even without their knowledge (an economic recession can be taking place even if no human subject is aware of it). Third, instead of making social reality depend on the action of collective intentionality – with an increasing social constructivism (Searle 2010) – documentality is capable of substantiating a "new realism" (Ferraris, 2012) that helps continental philosophy come out of the impasses of postmodernism and reconnect with analytic philosophy.  [Source of this description of Documentality: L. Caffo, "From Documentality to New Realism", in ''The Monist'', 97:2 April 2014].

==Ferraris: object = inscribed act==
According to the [[ontologist]] [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] (forthcoming), with documentality, Ferraris advances an innovative approach to social ontology that implies three steps.

===First step: the recognition of the sphere of social objects===
The first step is the recognition&amp;nbsp;– on the ground of the theories developed by [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Smith]] himself, (see in particular [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Smith]] 1999)&amp;nbsp;– of the sphere of ''social objects'', meaning, entities such as money, artworks, marriages, divorces and joint custody, years in prison and mortgages, the cost of oil and the tax codes, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Trial]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and still, economic crises, research projects, lectures and university degrees etc. These objects fill up our world more than stones, trees and coconuts do, and they are more important for us, given that a good part of our happiness or unhappiness depends on them.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 32-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second step: the identification of the law of constitution of social objects===
The second step is the identification of the law that brings social objects into being, namely that
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Object = Inscribed Act''&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: p. 174 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What this means is that a social object is the result of a social act (one that involves at least two persons or a person and a deputed machine), which is characterized by the fact of being registered on a piece of paper, a computer file or some other digital support, or even, simply, in the heads of persons.

As Smith recognizes, if taken literally, the OBJECT=Inscribed Act formulation does not make sense. For instance, if taken literally, this formulation implies that the US Constitution "is made of tiny oxidizing heaps of ink marks on parchment, and matters are helped only slightly if we add together all the printed and digital copies of the US Constitution and assert that the US Constitution is the mereological sum of all these multiple inscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Barry|title=How to Do Things with Documents|journal=Rivista di Estetica|date=2012|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/HowToDoThingsWithDocuments.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third step: the individuation of the sphere of documentality===
On the basis of the first two steps it is possible to develop an ontology capable of classifying documents and their selective storage, beginning with the grand divide between what Ferraris calls "strong documents" (inscriptions of acts), which make up social objects in the full sense, and "weak documents" (recordings of facts), which are secondary derivatives and of lesser importance.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The third step thus leads to the individuation of the sphere of Documentality, understood as the search for and the definition of the [[property (philosophy)|properties]] that constitute the [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s for the being of a social object.

==Documentality in eleven theses==
The theory of Documentality has been summarized by his author (Ferraris 2009a) in eleven fundamental theses:&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 358-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. ''Ontology catalogues the world of life.''
:The philosophy that guides this project is a descriptive [[metaphysics]] of a [[realism (philosophy)|realist]] type, which aims to account for the social world and everyday experience, which is to say, the world that stands outside the range of the [[natural science]]s. Its model is the catalogue. The sort of understanding proposed requires in the first instance the identification, classification and distinction of what there is in this world, how it is ordered, and how it is to be distinguished from the other things that there are.

:2. ''There are three types of objects: natural (or physical), ideal, and social.''
:Objects come in three kinds: (1) physical objects (mountains, rivers, human bodies, and animals) that exist in space and time and are independent from the subjects who know them, even if they may have been built by them, as with [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s (chairs, screwdrivers); (2) ideal objects (numbers, theorems, relations) that exist outside of space and time and are independent from the subjects who know them, but which, after having been discovered, can be socialized (for instance, a theorem can be published: still, it is the publication, not the theorem, that has a beginning in time); (3) social objects, that do not exist ''as such'' in space, since their physical presence is limited to the inscription (money is such because of what is written on the coin, on the banknote, on the memory of the credit card), but endure in time, and whose existence depends on the subjects who know, or at least can use, them and who, in certain cases, have constituted them. This latter circumstance displays how social objects, for which construction is necessary, depend on social ''acts'', whose ''inscription'' constitutes the ''object''.

:3. ''Ontology is distinct from epistemology.''
:As a point of methodology, it is necessary to outline a distinction between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The former concerns what there is independently of how we know it and of whether we know it or not. The latter is knowledge of what there is, or rather, what we are justified in believing in a given context. These two dimensions have often been confused, as we can see from the way we often make depend the being of objects on our knowledge of them.

:4. ''Social objects depend on subjects, but are not subjective.''
:The external world, understood in the first instance as the world of natural objects, is independent of conceptual schemes and perceptual apparatuses. In the same way, there is no continuous and necessary link that leads from perception to experience and from there to science, nor, on the other hand, knowledge is the main activity within our experience. In the world of social objects, by contrast, belief determines being, given that these objects depend on subjects. This does not mean that things like promises and money have a purely subjective dimension. Rather, it means that, unless there were subjects capable of recognizing social objects, such social objects would not exist.

:5. ''The constitutive rule of social objects is "Object = Inscribed Act".''
:It thus becomes possible to develop an ontology and an epistemology of social objects. The epistemology renews the tradition of the sciences of the spirit, defining itself as a "science of the letter", given the importance that inscriptions are endowed within the construction of social reality. Ontology is a theory of social objects, namely those that obey the constitutive rule "Object = Inscribed Act". That is to say, social objects are the result of social acts (and involve at least two persons) characterized by the fact of being inscribed: on paper, in a computer file or even simply in the heads of persons.

:6. ''There is nothing social outside the text.''
:The importance attributed to inscription is the characteristic feature of the theory of Documentality. The underlying idea is that the act is performed so as to produce an object; it is necessary that it be registered. A marriage or a promise that weren't inscribed, would not be an object, whereas a mountain can easily exist without being registered. In this sense, we do not hold that "there is nothing outside the text" (given that natural and ideal objects exist without inscriptions), but only that "there is nothing ''social'' outside the text".

:7. ''Society is not based on communication but on registration.''
:Because nothing social exists outside the text, papers, archives and documents constitute the fundamental elements of the social world. Society is not based on communication but on registration, which is the condition for the creation of social objects. Human beings grow as human beings and socialize through registration. Naked life is nothing but a remote starting point and culture begins very early making for a clothed life, which is manifested in registrations and imitations: languages, behaviors and rites. This explains why writing is so important and, even more, "archinscription", which is the realm of registration, that precedes and includes writing in its proper or current meaning.

:8. ''The mind is a surface that collects inscriptions.''
:As regards a theory of mind, social ontology is based on icnology, which is to say, a theory of traces (it is important to distinguish ''icnology'' as the science of traces from ''[[ichnology]]'' as a branch of geology). The representation of the mind as a ''[[tabula rasa|tabula]]'' or a writing surface is not a mere metaphor, but captures the fact that perceptions and thoughts come to us as inscriptions in our mind. But the mind is not just an inscribed surface, it is also capable of grasping inscriptions, namely the traces that there are in the world, on the surface that is before us in experience. We can make out an ascending hierarchy that takes in traces (any incision on a background), registrations (traces in the mind as a ''tabula'') and inscriptions in the technical sense (traces available to at least two persons).

:9. ''Documents in the strong sense are inscriptions of acts.''
:Considered as a theory of society, the ontology of social objects configures Documentality as a theory of documents as the highest form of social objects. The analysis of documents can be articulated into the analysis of documents in the strong sense, as inscriptions of acts, and that of documents in the weak sense, as registrations of facts. Documents can have practical purposes or they can be mainly directed to the evocation of sentiments. In the latter case, we have artworks, understood as those entities that pretend to be persons.

:10. ''The letter is the foundation of the spirit.''
:As a theory of [[culture]], the ontology of social objects becomes a [[phenomenology (archaeology)|phenomenology]] of the letter: no product of the spirit could exist without letter, registration and document; and, more radically, spirit itself finds the condition of its possibility in the letter and in the inscriptions that constitute us as social beings.

:11. ''The individuality shows itself in the signature.''
:As a theory of the subject, the ontology of social objects is divided into three parts: a theory of [[idiom]], of style, and of [[signature]]. In particular, the signature is the principle of [[individuation]] insofar as it is a way to publicly represent the presence and the identity of the subject.

==Documentality applied to other disciplines==

Documentality theory has been used in geopolitics and state theory as part of theory of understanding how nonphysical states can be established. States are precisely the kinds of entities documentality can help understand, because, it has been argued that states do not fit within the traditional Platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract, instead, belonging to a third category, the quasi-abstract. &lt;ref&gt;E.H. Robinson (2014), [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213829/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} Geopolitics 00, pp. 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-abstract objects have received attention from social ontologists of all kinds, including documentary scholars as a response to those social entities that do not fit Searle's "X counts as Y" formulation. &lt;ref&gt;B. Smith, (2008) 'Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World". In The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that document acts, as understood by documentary theory can establish states and thereby bring about their existence, as well as manipulate them in various ways (such as surrendering them after a war). &lt;ref&gt;E.H. Robinson (2014), [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213829/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} Geopolitics 00, pp. 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dual consciousness''' is a theoretical concept in [[neuroscience]]. It is proposed that it is possible that a person may develop two separate conscious entities within their one brain after undergoing a [[corpus callosotomy]]. The idea first began circulating in the neuroscience community after some [[split-brain]] patients exhibited the [[alien hand syndrome]], which led some scientists to believe that there must be two separate consciousnesses within the brain's left and right hemispheres in competition with one another once the [[corpus callosum]] is severed.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Gonzalo Munevar,  “The Myth of Dual Consciousness in the Split Brain: Contrary Evidence from Psychology and Neuroscience,” International Conference on Brain-Mind Proceedings, BMI Press, 2012 (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of dual consciousness has caused controversy in the neuroscience community. It has not been conclusively proven or disproven.

== Background ==
During the first half of the 20th Century, some neurosurgeons concluded that the best option of treating severe [[epilepsy]] was by severing the patient's corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is the primary communication mechanism between the brain's two cerebral hemispheres. For example, communication across the callosum allows information from both the left and right visual fields to be interpreted by the brain in a way that makes sense to comprehend the person's actual experience (visual inputs from both eyes are interpreted by the brain to make sense of the experience that you are looking at a computer that is directly in front of you). The procedure of surgically removing the corpus callosum is called a corpus callosotomy. Patients who have undergone a corpus callosotomy are colloquially referred to as "split-brain patients". They are called so because now their brain's left and right hemispheres are no longer connected by the corpus callosum.

Split-brain patients have been subjects for numerous psychological experiments that sought to discover what occurs in the brain now that the primary interhemispheric pathways have been disrupted. Notable researchers in the field include [[Roger Sperry]], one of the first to publish ideas involving a dual consciousness, and his famous graduate student, [[Michael Gazzaniga]]. Their results found a pattern amongst patients: severing the entire corpus callosum stops the interhemispheric transfer of perceptual, sensory, motor, and other forms of information. For most cases, corpus callosotomies did not in any way affect patients' real world functioning, however, those psychology experiments have demonstrated some interesting differences between split-brain patients and normal subjects.

== Split-brain patients and the corpus callosotomy ==

Mangun George. Cognitive Neuroscience The Biology of the Mind. 4th. 133. Print&lt;/ref&gt; William Van Wagenen proposed the idea of severing the corpus callosum to eliminate transcortical electrical signals across the brain's hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wagenen, W.P. &amp; Herren, R.Y. (1940). Surgical division of comissural pathways in the corpus callosum: Relation to spread of an epileptic seizure. ''Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, 44,'' 740-759.&lt;/ref&gt; If this could be achieved, then the seizures should be reduced or even completely eliminated.

The general procedure of a corpus callosotomy is as follows. The patient is put under anesthesia. Once the patient is in deep sleep, a [[craniotomy]] is performed. This procedure removes a section of the skull, leaving the brain exposed and accessible to the surgeon. The [[dura mater]] is pulled back so the deeper areas of the brain, including the corpus callosum, can be seen. Specialized instruments are placed into the brain that allows safe severing of the corpus. Initially, a partial callosotomy is performed, which only severs the front two thirds of the callosum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/corpus-callosotomy&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that because the back section of the callosum is preserved, visual information is still sent across both hemispheres. Though the corpus callosum loses a majority of its functioning during a partial callosotomy, it does not completely lose its capabilities. If this operation does not succeed in reducing the seizures, a complete callosotomy is needed to reduce the severity of the seizures.

A similar type of procedure, known as a [[commissurotomy]], involves severing a number of interhemispheric tracts (such as the [[anterior commissure]], the [[hippocampal commissure]] and the [[interthalamic adhesion|massa intermedia]] of the [[thalamus]]) in addition to the corpus callosum.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/872086410&lt;/ref&gt;

After surgery, the split-brain patients are often given extensive neuropsychological assessments. An interesting finding among split-brain patients is many of them claim to feel normal after the surgery and do not feel that their brains are "split".&lt;ref name=g&gt;Tim, Bayne. "The Unity of Consciousness and the Split-Brain Syndrome." Journal of Philosophy. (2008): 277-300. Web. 24 Mar. 2014.&lt;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/12844/Unity_of_Consciousness__Split-brain_web.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus callosotomy and commissurotomy have been successful in reducing, and in some cases, completely eliminating epileptic seizures. Van Wagenen's theory was correct.

== Alien Hand Syndrome ==

{{Main article|Alien Hand Syndrome}}

'''Alien hand syndrome''', sometimes used synonymously with '''anarchic hand'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/916005.stm | title=The Mind's Strange Syndromes | date=September 8, 2000 | publisher = BBC News}} "Even today, "anarchic hand" has earned the popular sobriquet Dr Strangelove syndrome - named after the eponymous scientist with the unruly limb in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film."&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[neurological disorder]] in which the afflicted person's hand appears to take on a mind of its own. Alien hand syndrome has been documented in some split brain patients.

=== Symptoms ===

The classic sign of Alien Hand Syndrome is that the affected person cannot control one of their hands. For example, if a split-brain patient with Alien Hand Syndrome is asked to pick up a glass with their right hand, as the right hand moves over to the glass, the left hand will interfere with the action, thwarting the right hand's task. The interference from the left hand is completely out of the control of the patient and is not being done “on purpose”. Affected patients at times cannot control the movements of their hands. Another example included patients unbuttoning a shirt with one hand, and the other hand simultaneously re-buttoning the shirt (although some reported feeling normal after their surgery).&lt;ref name=b&gt;Gonzalo Munevar, “Two Conscious Minds in the Same Brain? Split Brains and the Alien-Hand Syndrome,” Brain-Mind Magazine (online). Fall, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;Revonsuo, Antti. Consciousness: The Science of Subjectivity. New York: Psychology Press, 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to Dual Consciousness ===

When scientists first started observing the alien hand syndrome in split-brain patients, they began to question the nature of consciousness and began to theorize that perhaps when the corpus callosum is cut, consciousness also is split into two separate entities. This development added to the general appeal of split-brain research.

== Gazzaniga and LeDoux's experiment ==

=== Procedure and results ===

In 1978, Michael Gazzaniga and Joseph DeLoux&lt;ref name=c2&gt;Gazzaniga Page(s): Cover, Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind (Fourth Edition) by Michael Gazzaniga, Michael S., B Ivry Richard, and R. Mangun George. Cognitive Neuroscience The Biology of the Mind. 4th. 146-147. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Gazzaniga, and J. E. LeDoux, The Integrated Mind. Plenum
Press,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a unique phenomenon among split-brain patients who were asked to perform a simultaneous concept task. The patient was shown 2 pictures: of a house in the winter time and of a chicken's claw. The pictures were positioned so they would exclusively be seen in only one visual field of the brain (the winter house was positioned so it would only be seen in the patient's left visual field (LVF), which corresponds to the brain's right hemisphere, and the chicken's claw was placed so it would only be seen in the patient's right visual field (RVF), which corresponds to the brain's left hemisphere.

A series of pictures was placed in front of the patients. Gazzaniga and LeDoux then asked the patient to choose a picture with his right hand and a picture with his left hand. The paradigm was set up so the choices would be obvious for the patients. A snow shovel is used for shoveling the snowy driveway of the winter house and a chicken's head correlates to the chicken's claw. The other pictures do not in any way correlate with the 2 original pictures. In the study, a patient chose the snow shovel with his left hand (corresponding to his brain's right hemisphere) and his right hand chose the chicken's head (corresponding to the brain's left hemisphere). When the patient was asked why he had chosen the pictures he had chosen, the answer he gave was “The chicken claw goes with the chicken head, and you need a snow shovel to clean out the chicken shed”.

Why would he say this? Wouldn't it be obvious that the shovel goes with the winter house? For people with an intact corpus callosum, yes it is obvious, but not for a split-brain patient. Both the winter house and the shovel are being projected to the patient from his LVF, so his right hemisphere is receiving and processing the information and this input is completely independent from what is going on in the RVF, which involves the chicken's claw and head (the information being processed in the left hemisphere). The human brain's '''left hemisphere''' is primarily responsible interpreting the meaning of the sensory input it receives from both fields, however the left hemisphere has no knowledge of the winter house. Because it has no knowledge of the winter house, it must invent a logical reason for why the shovel was chosen. Since the only objects it has to work with are the chicken's claw and head, the left hemisphere interprets the meaning of choosing the shovel as “it is an object necessary to help the chicken, which lives in a shed, therefore, the shovel is used to clean the chicken’s shed”. Gazzaniga famously coined the term [[left brain interpreter]]&lt;ref&gt;The cognitive neuroscience of mind: a tribute to Michael S. Gazzaniga by Michael S. Gazzaniga, Patricia Ann Reuter-Lore 2010 {{ISBN|0-262-01401-7}} pages 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; to explain this phenomenon.

=== Interpreting Gazzaniga's "left brain interpreter" ===
{{citations missing|section|date=August 2018}}
What does the results of Gazzaniga and LeDoux's work suggest about the existence of a dual consciousness? There are varying possibilities.

* The left hemisphere dominates all interpretation of the split-brain patient's perceptual field, with the right hemisphere having little importance in these processes.
* If so, one could by extension claim there are 2 separate conscious entities that do not interact with each other or are in competition with each other and have separate interpretations of the stimuli, the left hemisphere winning the struggle. 
* Or perhaps the right hemisphere is unconscious of the snow house and shovel while the left hemisphere retains a conscious perception of its objects.

== Other experiments ==

=== Sperry-Gazzaniga ===

The Gazzaniga-LeDoux studies were based off previous studies done by Sperry-Gazzaniga.&lt;ref name=e&gt;R. W. Sperry, “Some Effects of Disconnecting the Cerebral Hemispheres,” The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1981Lecture, 8 December 1981. From Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1981-1990, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Jan Lindsten, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Sperry examined split-brain patients. Sperry's experiment included a subject being seated at a table, with a shield blocking the visions from the subject's hands, including the objects on the table and the examiner seated across. The shield was also used as a viewing screen. On the shield, the examiner can select to present the visual material to both hemispheres or to selective hemispheres by means of having the patient look at certain points on the viewing screen. The patient is briefly exposed to the stimuli on the viewing screen. The stimuli shown to the left eye goes to the right hemisphere and the visual material shown to the right eye will be projected to the left hemisphere. During the experiment, when the stimulus was shown to the left side of the screen, the patient indicated he did not see anything. Patients have shown the inability to describe in writing or in speech the stimuli that was shown briefly to left side. The speaking hemisphere, which in most people is the left hemisphere, would not have awareness of stimulus being shown to the right hemisphere (left visual field), except the left hand was able to point to the correct object. Based off his observations and data, Sperry concluded each hemisphere possessed its own consciousness.

=== Revonsuo ===

[[Antti Revonsuo|Revonsuo]] explains a procedure that was similar in nature to the Sperry-Gazzaniga design. Split-brain patients are shown a picture with two objects: a flower and a rabbit. The flower is exclusively shown in the right visual field, which is interpreted by the left hemisphere and the rabbit is exclusively shown in the left visual field, which is interpreted by the right hemisphere. The left brain is seeing the flower as the right brain is simultaneously viewing the rabbit. When the patients were asked what they saw, patients said they only saw the flower and did not see the rabbit. The flower is in the right visual field and the left hemisphere can only see the flower. The left hemisphere dominates the interpretation of the stimulus and since it cannot see the rabbit (only being represented in the right hemisphere), patients do not believe they saw a rabbit. They can, however, still point to the rabbit with their left hand. Revonsuo stated that it seemed that one consciousness saw the flower and another consciousness saw the rabbit independently from one another.&lt;ref name=d /&gt;

=== Joseph ===

Rhawn Joseph observed two patients who had both undergone a complete corpus callosotomy. Joseph observed that one of the patient's right hemisphere is able to gather, comprehend, and express information. The right hemisphere was able to direct activity to the patient's left arm and leg. The execution of the left arm and leg's action as was inhibited by the left hemisphere. Joseph found that the patient's left leg would attempt to move forward as if to walk straight but the right leg would either refuse move or begin to walk in the opposite direction. After observing the struggles of the execution of activities involving the left and right arms and legs, led Joseph to believe that the two hemispheres possessed their own consciousness.&lt;ref name=f&gt;R. Joseph, “Dual Mental Functioning in a Split-Brain Patient,” Journal of Clinical Psychology, 44, 1988, pp. 770-779.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph also noted that the patient had other specific instances of conflict between the right and left hemispheres including, the left hand (right hemisphere) carrying out actions contrary to the left hemisphere's motives such as the left hand turning off the television immediately after the right hand turned it on. Joseph found that the patient's left leg would only allow the patient to return home when the patient was going for a walk and would reject continuing to go for that walk.

=== Further observations by Joseph ===

In the laboratory, a patient was given two different fabrics: a wire screen in his left hand and a piece of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the left hand, he was able to correctly indicate and point with the left hand to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his left hand, however, the right hand tried to stop the left hand and make the left hand point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The left hand continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the left hand. During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”. Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the left hand (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.&lt;ref name=f /&gt;

== Controversy and alternative explanations ==

Proponents of the dual consciousness theory have caused a great amount of controversy and debate within the neuroscience community. The magnitude of such a claim: that consciousness can be split into two entities within the one brain are considered by some scientists to be audacious. There is no concrete evidence to validate the theory and the current evidence provided is, at best, anecdotal.

The most powerful claims against the dual consciousness theory are:

* There is no universally accepted definition of “consciousness”. 
* Split-brain patients are not the only people to exhibit the Alien Hand Syndrome. People with intact brains who have suffered a stroke may also have the Alien Hand Syndrome. It also has been observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease or in patients who have brain tumors.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows, A. (2009). Alien hand syndrome, and other too weird, not to be true stories. New York: Workman Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Other existing and established neurological mechanisms can account for an explanation of the same phenomena.

Gonzalo Munevar has proposed an alternative explanation to demonstrate that these strange behaviors are spawned from areas in the brain and not by a dual consciousness.&lt;ref name=a /&gt; Two cortical areas in particular, the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex, are crucial in the planning of executing motor tasks to external stimuli presented in the person's perceptual field.&lt;ref name=i&gt;D. A. Rosenbaum, J. D. Slotta, J. Vaughan, and R. Plamondon, 1991.
Optimal Movement Selection. Psychology Science, 2, pp. 86-91.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person may pick up a glass of water with his right hand and put it up to his lips for a drink. The person may have picked up the glass with his right hand, but well before this action takes place, the PMC and SMA consider a variety of different possibilities of how this action could be performed. He could have picked it up with his left hand, his mouth, even his foot! He could have done it quickly or slowly. Many possibilities are entertained, but few are actually executed. These actions are sent from the PMC to the Motor Cortex for execution. The rest are inhibited by the SMA and are not performed.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

It is also important to understand that the processes of the SMA and PMC are done '''unconsciously'''. The SMA and PMC consider the many alternative actions many milliseconds before the chosen action takes place.&lt;ref name=h /&gt; The person is never consciously aware of these alternative possibilities the brain has juggled with before he picks it up with the right hand; he just does it. The action of picking up the glass with the right hand is also performed unconsciously. It may be preferable to use his right hand because he is right handed and doing so is therefore more comfortable or perhaps the glass is placed on his right side and the possibility that expends the least amount of energy is using the right hand to pick it up.

Another important fact about the PMC is that its activation is bilateral. When it is activated, it is activated in both hemispheres of the brain. Gazzaniga observed and wrote about this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=h&gt;M. S. Gazzaniga, R. B. Ivry, and G. R. Mangun, Cognitive
Neuroscience. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When the corpus callosum is severed, many interhemispheric interactions are disrupted. Many areas of the brain become compromised, including the SMA. If the SMA has trouble regulating and inhibiting the actions of the PMC, it is very possible that conflicting sets of actions may be sent to the MC and performed (accounting for both hands reaching for the glass, even if only one hand is intended to grab it). It would make the appearance that there is a dual consciousness competing for dominance over the other for control of the brain, but it is not the case.

The fact that the Alien Hand Syndrome eventually goes away in some split-brain patients is not evidence of one consciousness “defeating” the other and taking complete control of the brain.&lt;ref name=h /&gt; It is likely that the plasticity of the brain may be the cause for alleviating the disorder. Eventually the split patient's brain may find adaptive routes to compensate for the lost interhemispheric communication, such as alternative pathways involving subcortical structures that perform subcortical interhemispheric inhibition to regain a sense of normalcy between the two hemispheres.

==Models of multiple consciousnesses==
	
Michael Gazzaniga, while working on the model of dual consciousness, came to the conclusion that simple dual consciousness (i.e. right-brain/left-brain model of the mind) is a gross oversimplification and the brain is organized into hundreds maybe even thousands of modular-processing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gazzaniga |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael S. Gazzaniga |last2=LeDoux |first2=Joseph |authorlink2=Joseph E. LeDoux |date=1978 |title=The Integrated Mind |pages=132-161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gazzaniga |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael S. Gazzaniga |date=1985 |title=The Social Brain. Discovering the Networks of the Mind |pages=77-79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by [[Carl Gustav Jung|Carl Jung]] in 1935 when he stated, "The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not."&lt;ref&gt;(Review: Dissociationism Revived, Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, Science, New Series, Vol. 200, No. 4342 (May 12, 1978), pp. 654-655; Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar models (which also claim that mind is formed from many little agents, i.e. the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by:
* [[Marvin Minsky|Marvin Minsky's]] “[[Society of Mind]]” model claims that mind is built up from the interactions of simple parts called ''agents'', which are themselves mindless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=The Society of Mind|date=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-60740-5|pages=17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thomas R. Blakeslee described the brain model which claims that ''brain is composed of hundreds of independent centers of thought called “modules”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blakeslee |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas R. Blakeslee |date=1996 |title=Beyond the Conscious Mind. Unlocking the Secrets of the Self |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neurocluster Brain Model describes the brain as a massively parallel computing machine in which huge number of neuroclusters process information independently from each other. The neurocluster which most of the time has the access to [[Actuator|actuators]] (i.e. neurocluster which most of the time acts upon an environment using actuators) is called the ''main personality''. Other neuroclusters which do not have access to actuators or which have only short duration and limited access to actuators are called “autonomous neuroclusters”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neuroclusterbrain.com |title=Official Neurocluster Brain Model site |access-date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michio Kaku]] described the brain model using the analogy of ''large corporation'' which is controlled by ''CEO''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaku |first=Michio |authorlink=Michio Kaku |date=2014 |title=[[The Future of the Mind]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert E. Ornstein]] claimed that ''the mind is a squadron of simpletons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ornstein |first= Robert |authorlink= Robert Ornstein |date=1992 |title=Evolution of Consciousness: The Origins of the Way We Think |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jCPAYuKp9l0|Robert Ornstein: The Evolution of Consciousness (excerpt) - Thinking Allowed DVD w/ Jeffrey Mishlove}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ernest Hilgard]] described neodissociationist theory which claims that a “hidden observer” is created in the mind while hypnosis is taking place and this “hidden observer” has his own separate consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilgard|first=Ernest|title=Divided consciousness: multiple controls in human thought and action.|authorlink=Ernest Ropiequet "Jack" Hilgard|date=1977|publisher= Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-39602-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilgard|first=Ernest|title=Divided consciousness: multiple controls in human thought and action (expanded edition).|authorlink=Ernest Ropiequet "Jack" Hilgard|date=1986|publisher= Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-80572-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==

Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon was born to Olympia Jardin and Frederick Charles Gordon in [[Port of Spain, Trinidad]], where he received his early education at [[Queen's Royal College]] (QRC),&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]], ''The Progress of the African Race Since Emancipation and Prospects for the Future'', The Majority Press, 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; graduating as one of the school's most brilliant scholars.&lt;ref name=Philip2015&gt;Ira Philip, [http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150321/ISLAND/150329948 "Remembering Mazumbo, a dynamic freedom fighter"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 21 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 he went to [[Scotland]] to study medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. There he met and married a fellow medical student, Clara Christian (who had previously studied music in the US at [[Hampton Institute]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and [[Oberlin College]], [[Ohio]]).&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110616/ISLAND11/706149914/-1 "Dr EF Gordon – fought tirelessly for equal rights for black Bermudians"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 16 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; To the displeasure of her father George James Christian, a Dominican barrister who had settled in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedominican.net/articles/christian.htm "George James Christian: Pioneer in Africa"], TheDominican.net, Volume No. 1, Issue No. 32, 27 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; she abandoned her medical studies to begin a family with Gordon.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/moira-stuart "Moira Stuart", ''Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==

Qualifying as a doctor at the age of 23 in 1918, Gordon was for some time a medical practitioner in the small Scottish town of [[Kingussie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/past-stories/moira-stuart.shtml "Moira Stuart", ''Who Do You Think You Are?'', BBC.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he returned to the Caribbean with his wife and young family. He briefly worked in Trinidad, then went on to become chief medical supervisor in [[Dominica]].&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;

===Move to Bermuda===
In 1924, Gordon went to Bermuda, where he would set up a busy medical practice on Heathcote Hill in [[Somerset, Bermuda|Somerset]].&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; According to biographer Ira Philip, Gordon "was brought to Bermuda by [[Sandys Parish|Sandys]] businessman William Robinson to fill a void caused by the death of black Dr Arnold Packwood. The all white local medical board was embarrassed when Dr Gordon passed what he termed was an impossible examination which he contended was calculated to fail him."&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, [http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20130309/ISLAND09/703099993 "Dr Olivia Tucker — pioneering pharmacist denied the opportunity to work in her homeland"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon began to take up the cause of black nurses and the discrimination they faced in employment in Bermuda, writing a series of letters dating from 1929 to the editor of ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'' criticising the refusal of the Bermuda Welfare Society to hire Blacks as district nurses.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; After decades of lobbying, the first black district nurse to be hired was Leonie Harford in 1963.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;

==Political life==

After standing unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1933 and 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Eva N. Hodgson, ''Second Class Citizens; First Class Men'', 2nd edition, Bermuda: The Writers Machine, 1988, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon won a seat in [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] in 1946.

===Name change===
On 22 June 1947,&lt;ref name=100Facts&gt;''Mazumbo: 100 Facts and Quotes by Dr. E. F. Gordon'', Writers' Machine, 1994, pp. 14, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; in protest at the fact that his fellow parliamentarians persistently refused to address him by his correct title, and that a Bermuda newspaper, the ''[[Mid-Ocean News]]'', prefixed "Mr." to the names of white members of Bermuda's Parliament (second oldest in the world), but called him simply Gordon,&lt;ref name=100Facts /&gt; he announced that henceforth he was to be known by the African name of '''Mazumbo''', with no prefix.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; His notice to this effect in ''The Royal Gazette'' read:
:"I, Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of Edinburgh University, President General of the Bermuda Industrial Union, President of the Progressive Bermuda League and Member of Parliament for St. George's, hereby declare that from henceforth I shall be known as Mazumbo."
He gave as explanation: "The name Gordon, which I inherited, reminds me very painfully that some Scotsman in some other age compelled a grandmother of mine to submit to his desires. In Bermuda I am black and treated as Bermuda treats the black people.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson (1988, pp. 70–71) writes: "The daily paper often underscored its contempt for coloured people by refusing to attach a title to them in any reference to them.... [Dr. Gordon's] gesture had the value of drawing the insult to the attention of many Negroes, who, from long familiarity, tended to take so many insults for granted. It was part of Dr. Gordon's overall programme of stimulating awareness on the part of the people who were so hard pressed that they had little time to think about the basis of their problems. He understood, very well, that support was gained for these political battles through starkly presented ideas, and the simple statement of the injustices which the people faced in their daily lives."&lt;/ref&gt; So I want to be called by a name that belongs to my race and requires no prefix." He was further quoted as saying that he had taken his new name from "a famous West African chieftain, who had once been received by [[Queen Victoria]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779223,00.html "BERMUDA: Grandpa Was a Scotsman", 21 July 1947]; cited in ''Time magazine'', 21 December 2011 (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a reference to a 19th-century Trinidadian lawyer called [[Emmanuel Mzumbo Lazare|Emmanuel Lazare]], popularly known as Mazumbo (or Mzumbo) Lazare, about whom Maureen Warner-Lewis has written: "although born in the Antilles, Lazare appropriated, or condoned the use of, an overtly African designation. The name was a symbol of his identification with black people and the poor. He was a defender of their rights, joined the [[Pan-African]] Association founded in 1901 in England by fellow Trinidadian [[Henry Sylvester Williams]], and became a moving spirit behind democratic political reforms at the turn of the twentieth century." This characterisation of Mazumbo Lazare is additional evidence for Gordon's motivation in associating himself with the name.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Warner-Lewis, ''Central Africa in the Caribbean: Transcending time, Transforming Cultures''. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press, 2003; p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality in Parliament===
As a Member of the Colonial Parliament (MCP), Gordon was a fiery and sometimes controversial orator. After the death in July 1948 of the Speaker of the House of Assembly Sir [[Reginald Conyers]] (who in his will left money for the Port Royal School in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], providing it was "used for the education of white children"), Gordon told a public meeting that he had only attended Conyers' funeral to "make sure he was put in the hole".&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; According to Hodgson, Gordon's "dramatic personality, his drive, and his unabashed theatricals had done what no one else either could do, or chose to do. He had alerted the Negro masses, he had given expression to their unvoiced despair and anger, often his words had given shape and form to emotions which they themselves could hardly define."&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson (1988), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA)===
Championing the rights of black and working-class Bermudians, Gordon was asked to become president of the Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA) in 1944, which fought for trade union rights and was committed to the removal of segregation and the adoption of universal adult suffrage. Membership of the BWA had by then dwindled to 200 but under Gordon's vigorous leadership it increased to 5,000 in 1945.&lt;ref name=Zuill&gt;W. S. Zuill, ''The Story of Bermuda and Her People'' (1973), Macmillan Caribbean, 2nd revised edition 1983, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he began his campaign to petition for social and constitutional change, and in that year the Legislature passed Bermuda's first Trade Union and Disputes Act,&lt;ref name=Zuill /&gt; which was designed to curb the fledgling BWA, making it illegal for a union to have a newspaper or operate a business.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; Gordon took the lead in the subsequent establishment that year of the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]] (BIU),&lt;ref name="Robert J 2004, pp. 101-02"&gt;Robert J. Alexander with Eldon M. Parker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fCmTbz1XdMwC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=edgar+fitzgerald+gordon+bermuda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zKXnuyJ0vW&amp;sig=eYGBI6eOaSGYDvQ2hGdK-ZULo0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwDGoVChMI98HqwMnSxgIV0ArbCh2YJA8r#v=onepage&amp;q=edgar%20fitzgerald%20gordon%20bermuda&amp;f=false ''A History of Organized Labor in the English-Speaking West Indies''], Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2004, pp. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biuhistory.bm"&gt;[http://rjones8.wix.com/biuhistory#!events-in-history "From BWA to BIU"], BIU History.&lt;/ref&gt; and the BWA for the time being continued as its political arm.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;

===Petition to British Colonial Office===
During an extended visit to England from December 1946 to March 1947, Gordon presented a petition containing over 5,000 signatures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtec.bm/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_813_0_0_43/http;/ptpublisher.gov.bm;7087/publishedcontent/publish/gov__top_level__org__house_/government/gov___history/articles/1900s.html?qid=78569854&amp;rank=9 Government of Bermuda website.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] from the BWA outlining various concerns, including the limited franchise, segregation, and restricted occupational opportunities.&lt;ref name=BdaFranchise&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.bm/~electb/images/bermuda_franchise.pdf "1946 – Dr. E. F. Gordon delivers Bermuda Workers’ Association Petition to the Colonial Office in Great Britain"], The Evolution of Bermuda's Franchise, compiled by James E. Smith. Parliamentary Registry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150909/COMMENT01/150909742 "When the times they were a-changin’"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 9 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only seven per cent of the population could vote, and (as Meredith Ebbin notes) there were more votes cast than actual voters because a property owner could vote in every parish where he owned land. It was a system that gave "the monied classes a distinct and definite control over the election results", Gordon said, pointing out that while the UK and its dependencies had undertaken voting reforms, Bermuda had operated under the same system since 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Ebbin, [http://bermudasun.bm/Content/OPINION/Opinion/Article/To-vote-or-not-to-vote--it-was-not-always-an-option/4/135/62296 "To vote or not to vote: it was not always an option"], ''BDA Sun'', 14 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was debated in the [[British Parliament]], which while condemning many of the practices highlighted in the petition refused Dr. Gordon's request for a [[Royal Commission]] to investigate social, political and economic conditions on the island. The Colonial Secretary subsequently issued a document (Command Paper 7093), sent to the Governor, Admiral Sir [[Ralph Leatham]], strongly recommending positive and progressive changes to the colony's discriminatory laws.&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile"&gt;[http://bernews.com/2011/04/national-hero-dr-e-f-gordon/ National Hero Profile: Dr. E. F.

At the 1948 election Gordon lost his House of Assembly seat – a setback attributable to his preoccupation with a dock workers' dispute that year, which had limited the time he could devote to his Parliamentary duties – but he was re-elected in 1953.&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt;

===Queen's visit to Bermuda===
In November 1953, when the newly crowned [[Queen Elizabeth II]] made Bermuda the first (24-hour) stop in her tour of [[the Commonwealth]],&lt;ref name="Bermuda Online" /&gt; Gordon learned that of more than 1,000 guests to be invited to a Government House garden party in her honour only 60 were black, and that not a single black Bermudian had been asked to attend the official state dinner.&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; With the intention of focusing world attention on Bermuda's racially stratified society, Gordon passed this news to the British press and [[Reuters]] reported the resultant angry protests from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]''. In its editorial the ''Herald'' stated: "Perhaps others may benefit from this instance of gross ill manners. It is time everyone from Governors downwards grasped the facts about this British Commonwealth. Within its frontiers coloured people outnumber whites by more than eight to one. One of the moral pledges by which it is held together is that the colour bar should be utterly destroyed as speedily as possible...."&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; As Bernews notes: "The Queen set foot in Bermuda the day the story broke. She was photographed that same afternoon meeting a broadly smiling, tail-coated Dr. Gordon in St. George’s."&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt;

==Cricket==
Keenly interested in cricket, Gordon believed that Bermuda would benefit by closer contact with the islands of the [[West Indies]], which were then gaining ascendancy in [[Test cricket]]. He championed the Bermudian cricketer [[Alma Hunt]], who in 1933 went to Trinidad to take part in the trial games from which would be selected the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies team]] for the Test series in England that summer. Although proving himself both on and off the field, Hunt was not eventually given a place.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, ''Freedom Fighters (From Monk To Mazumbo)'', London: Akira Press, 1987, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon pointed out that Hunt's status would have been more assured had there been an official body to deal with finance and represent him, and advocated for a [[Bermuda Cricket Board]] of Control, which was eventually formed in 1938. He was instrumental in bringing about the first ever West Indian cricket tour to Bermuda in 1939, which was headed by Trinidadian [[Ben Sealey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, in ''Freedom Fighters'' (1987), pp. 152–58, quotes a letter dated 20 October 1953 from Gordon to the ''Mid-Ocean News'', detailing Gordon's role in the sequence of events.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exclusion principle''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] principle that states:

:If an [[event (philosophy)|event]] ''e'' [[causality|causes]] event ''e*'', then there is no event ''e#'' such that ''e#'' is [[supervenience|non-supervenient]] on ''e'' and ''e#'' causes ''e*''.

==In physicalism==
{{Main|physicalism}}
The exclusion principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario; One usually considers that the desire to lift one’s arm as a mental event, and the lifting on one's arm, a physical event. According to the exclusion principle, there must be no event that does not supervene on ''e'' while causing ''e*''. To show this better, substitute "''the desire to lift one's arm''" for "''e''", and "''one to lift their arm''" for "''e*''".

:If ''the desire to lift one's arm'' causes ''one to lift their arm'', then there is no event such that it is non-supervenient on ''the desire to lift one's arm'' and it causes ''one to lift their arm''.

This is interpreted as meaning that mental events supervene upon the physical. However, some philosophers do not accept this principle, and accept [[epiphenomenalism]], which states that mental events are caused by physical events, but physical events are not caused by mental events (called ''causal impotence''). However, If ''e#'' does not cause ''e'', then there is no way to verify that ''e*'' exists. Yet, this debate has not been settled in the philosophical community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3794">''Female:Pressure'' is an international network of female, [[transgender]] and [[non-binary]] artists in the fields of electronic music and digital arts founded by [[Susanne Kirchmayr|Electric Indigo]] in 1998 : from musicians, composers and DJs to visual artists, cultural workers and researchers. A worldwide resource of talent that can be searched after criteria like location, profession, style or name. "Why are there so few women active in the electronic music scene?" - each one of us has heard this question a thousand times... Here is the answer: It's not our number, it's about how and if we are recognized!

It was founded as a information resource and network for improving communication and representation of its members. It is notable for raising the profile of women and their work, including through festivals and media campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewire.co.uk/news/26275/female_pressure-inaugurating-perspectives-festival-for-female-musicians|title=Female: Pressure inaugurating Perspectives festival for female musicians&amp;nbsp;— The Wire|work=The Wire Magazine&amp;nbsp;— Adventures In Modern Music|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pop-kultur.berlin/en/modules/female-pressure-panel-sky-deep-marlene-engel-christine-kakaire/|title=Female Pressure Panel at Pop-Kultur Festival 2017 in Berlin|work=Pop Kultur|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/femalepressure-promoter-weighs-female-lineups/|title=A female:pressure Promoter Weighs In On All-Female Lineups|last=|first=|date=|website=Electronic Beats|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://loop.ableton.com/2015/participants/femalepressure/|title=female:pressure|website=loop.ableton.com|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/superstar-djs/a-41298236|title=Superstar DJs from Germany: A Global Success Story {{!}} Documentary &amp; Report: Watch DW-videos online for free {{!}} DW {{!}} 16.11.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/study-confirms-theres-still-a-gender-gap-in-festival-bookings/|title=Study Confirms: There’s Still A Gender Gap In Festival Bookings&amp;nbsp;– Telekom Electronic Beats|last=Telekom|work=Telekom Electronic Beats|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/someone-made-a-database-of-female-and-non-binary-artists/|title=Someone Made A Database Of Female And Non-Binary Artists&amp;nbsp;– Telekom Electronic Beats|last=Telekom|work=Telekom Electronic Beats|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://djmag.com/news/we-lost-ourselves-heady-techno-emika-and-dj-red-berlin|title=We lost ourselves to heady techno with Emika and DJ Red in Berlin|date=2017-01-31|work=DJMag.com|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/new-tumblr-documents-women-and-their-music-gear-5436612|title=New Tumblr Documents Women and Their Music Gear|last=Ohanesian|first=Liz|date=2015-03-18|work=L.A.

A '''floodgate effect''' is situation in which a small action can result in a far greater effect with no easily discernible limit.  The original [[analogy]] is that of a [[floodgate]], which once opened, no matter how minutely, will allow water to flow from either side through the gate until both sides are balanced up.  It may also be used to refer to the effect where, once a floodgate has been opened, water will gush out in a torrent through the gate, making it easier to continue to open the gate, but harder to close it.

The term is commonly used to illustrate a situation where a precedent will set the stage for repeated performances, the number of which is hard to control. Such an example can be illustrated as follows:

''The setting up of a [[redlight district]] here will create a floodgate effect, causing redlight districts to be set up elsewhere.''

The '''Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption''' ('''GOPAC'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المنظمة العالمية للبرلمانيين ضد الفساد; [[French language|French]]: ''Organisation mondiale des parlementaires contre la corruption''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "Organización Mundialde Parlamentarios Contra la Corrupción") is an [[International nongovernmental organization]] made up of parliamentarians from across the world, working together to combat corruption, strengthen good government, and uphold the rule of law. Based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], GOPAC has fifty-two national chapters in five continental associations. GOPAC supports its members through original research, global [[anti‑corruption]] capacity building, and international peer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOPAC Network|url=http://www.gopacnetwork.org/|publisher=Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GOPAC seeks to achieve ethical and accountable governance throughout the world, through effective anti-corruption mechanisms and co-operation between parliamentarians, government leaders, and civil society.

==History==
GOPAC was founded in October 2002 as a result of a Global Conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada which brought together approximately 170 parliamentarians and 400 observers who were part of the international leadership in the fight against political corruption and for good governance.

As it has grown, GOPAC has formed a web of partnerships with other international institutions, including the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], the [[World Bank]], and [[Transparency International]].

==Organization==
GOPAC works internationally, and is present on every populated continent of the world.  It operates in four official languages: [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; [[English language|English]]; [[French language|French]]; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Membership===
Individual membership in GOPAC is open to current and former democratically-elected legislators.

There are also National Chapters in fifty-two countries, grouped into six continental regions: Africa; Latin America; North America; Oceania; South Asia; and Southeast Asia.

Individual legislators may be members of GOPAC even if there is no national chapter in their countries.  Similarly, national chapters can be members of GOPAC even if their continent has not formed a continental association.

===Global Task Forces===
GOPAC has five thematic Global Task Forces (GTFs): Anti-Money Laundering; Parliamentary Ethics and Conduct; Parliamentary Oversight; Participation of Society, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption; and its Women in Parliament Network.

===Global Conference===
Every two years, GOPAC convenes a Global Conference to act as an international focus for parliamentarians from across the world to set the international agenda, and to collaborate in fighting political corruption. The 2013 Global Conference was held in Manila, Philippines.

Greenprinting can galvanize public support and encourage partners to work toward common conservation goals. Greenprinting often involves use of state-of-the-art maps and models created with [[Geographic Information System]] ([[GIS]]) software that combines layers of spatial and [[demographic]] information to guide [[growth management]] efforts.

'''Heather Dewey-Hagborg''' (born June 4, 1982, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is an information artist and [[Do-it-yourself biology|bio-hacker]].&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; She is most noted for her project [[#Stranger Visions|''Stranger Visions'']]: a series of portraits created from [[DNA]] she recovered from discarded items, such as hair, cigarettes and chewing gum while living in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; She sequenced the DNA at the Brooklyn open [[biotechnology]] laboratory, [[Genspace]].&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; From the extracted DNA, she determined gender, ethnicity and other factors and then used face-generating software and a [[3D printer]] to create a speculative, algorithmically determined 3D portrait. While critical of technology and surveillance, her work has been found disturbing by some critics.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/tech/innovation/dna-face-sculptures/ Natalie Angley, "Artist creates faces from DNA left in public"], CNN.com, September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Spurious Memories.jpg|thumb|''Spurious Memories'' (2007)]]
Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose works explore the intersection between art and science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colanduno|first1=Derek|authorlink=Derek Colanduno|title=Pieces of You #223|url=http://www.skepticality.com/piecesofyou|website=Skepticality|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student in the Information Arts program at [[Bennington College]],&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Alec|title=Mask Crusader|journal=New Yorker|date=July 1, 2013|volume=89|issue=19|pages=22–23|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/01/mask-crusader|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she participated in computer science classes, which laid the groundwork for the science-based artwork she would later envision using [[algorithms]], [[electronics]], and [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 2003.

Dewey-Hagborg continued refining her work as an artist and computer programmer, studying [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; while obtaining a Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) in Interactive Telecommunications from [[New York University]] (NYU)&lt;ref name="Schwendener1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. It was here she curated a robotic performance art show called ''Robots on the March!'' in March 2005, and exhibited a piece called ''Lighter than Air: an experiment in constructing an autonomous flying robot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photosynthesis and Experiments in Sustainable Robotics|url=http://www.atasite.org/calendar/archive/index-24133.html|website=Artists' Television Access|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=March 25 – April 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Lighter Than Air|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJmu-AzrXH4|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final project at NYU, Dewey-Hagborg explored the question "Can computers be creative?" in an exhibit she called Spurious Memories. She developed an autonomous face categorizing and generating software program which recognized facial components, made comparisons and adjustments, and produced unique representations of the human face through mass exposure to facial images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Spurious Memories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1elpx1rz_R0|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from NYU, she became a doctoral candidate in electronics arts at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawsey|first1=Josh|title=Art emerges from DNA left behind|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324281004578352473833386586|accessdate=August 5, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|issue=Eastern Edition|date=March 11, 2013|page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Squires, A."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Squires|first1=Acacia|title=Litterbugs beware: turning found DNA into portraits|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/12/183363361/litterbugs-beware-turning-found-dna-into-portraits|website=NPR|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodrigo, N."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodrigo|first1=Nandi|title=Faces in the Crowd, Printed in 3-D|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/faces-in-the-crowd-printed-in-3-d/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|website=The New York Times Blog|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herper, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herper|first1=Matthew|title=Artist Creates Portraits from People's DNA.

As of August 2014, Dewey-Hagborg resides in [[Chicago, Illinois]], teaching art and technology studies at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Technology Studies: Faculty|url=http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/heatherdewey-hagborg|website=School of the Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educator her areas of interest include art and technology, multimedia, digital photography, research-based art and programming, and computer science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewey-Hagborg/&gt;

==Selected projects==
===Totem===
[[File:Heather Dewey-Hagborg Totem.jpg|thumb|''Totem'' (2010)]]
Dewey-Hagborg's ''Totem'' (2010) was a site-specific multimedia sculpture characterizing her earlier work. ''Totem'', an idol, was designed to explore the implications of language and artificial intelligence using [[machine learning]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Guide July thru December 2011|url=http://issuu.com/groundsforsculpture/docs/summerfall2011|website=ISSUU.com|accessdate=August 5, 2014|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting audio surveillance techniques to eavesdrop on and record conversations at the installation site, Dewey-Hagborg wrote algorithms to then isolate word sequences and grammatical structures into commonly used units. Influenced by [[Hebbian theory]], she programmed the sculpture's computer to generate speech based on the most frequently occurring language structures in any given recording period. Over time, the least frequently elicited words or units would fade or be dropped from the sculpture's spoken vocabulary. The remaining units, stored in the sculpture's memory, were then spoken at random intervals.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt;

The piece also reflected the writings of psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]]. According to Dewey-Hagborg, Jaynes theorized that an early form of human consciousness evolved as a result of hallucinated speech experienced by the Mari civilization of the [[Euphrates]]. The ancient people interpreted water trickling through a goddess statue as whispers or vocalizations from the goddess herself.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg saw a parallel between the "mystical and authoritative power of language in the ancient world and the force of power of technology today"&lt;ref name="Totem"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Totem|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsTu3Iv1408|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with this piece, sought to explore how technology is used to shape public opinion and behavior.

Martha Schwendener, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that ''Totem'' showed promise, but, because of audio difficulties and its fragmented, randomly generated speech, the piece "failed to connect human speech, meaning, and technology in a profound fashion."&lt;ref name="Schwendener, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/nyregion/at-grounds-for-sculpture-works-by-james-surls-and-daniel-henderson-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 5, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Stranger Visions''===
[[File:Stranger Visions-1.jpg|left|thumb|''Stranger Visions'' Portraits (2012)]]
''Stranger Visions'' (2012&amp;ndash;2014) is a science-based, artistic exploration using DNA as a starting point for Dewey-Hagborg's lifelike, computer generated 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Mark|title=A 'Cyber' exhibit as timely as the news|work=Washington Post|date=September 18, 2013|page=E18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krulwich|first1=Robert|title=Artist plays detective: Can I reconstruct a face from a piece of hair?|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/28/196307915/artist-plays-detective-can-i-reconstruct-a-face-from-a-piece-of-hair|website=NPR|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trafics optiques a l'heure numerique: a Creteil, l'exposition "Micro Macro" interroge notre perception du reel"|work=Le Monde|date=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone could come along and mine them for information."&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; She hoped, by producing realistic sculptures of anonymous people using clues from their DNA, to spark a debate about the use or the potential misuse of DNA profiling, privacy, and genetic surveillance.&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stranger Visions: The DNA You Leave Behind|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/stranger-visions-the-dna-you-leave-behind|website=Wilson Center|accessdate=August 14, 2014|date=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C: International Contemporary Art"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Heather Dewey-Hagborg Stranger Visions|journal=C: International Contemporary Art|date=Winter 2014|volume=120|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello&gt;{{cite news|last1=Passarello|first1=D|title=Dna smarriti, una seconda vita che si fa opera d'arte|work=Il Sole 24 Ore|date=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her research for ''Stranger Visions'', Dewey-Hagborg took a three-week crash-course&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; in biotechnology at Genspace, a non-profit, community-based biotechnology laboratory in New York. She was astonished to learn how much an amateur biologist could learn about someone.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Linda|title=Guarding Our DNA: Art project exposes the vulnerability of the genetic material we unintentionally leave behind|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=June 24, 2013|volume=91|issue=25|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pauwels|first1=Eleanore|title=Leave me your DNA ... and I'll 3-D print your face|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/01/dna-art-recreate-faces|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began the process of extracting DNA from the samples she collected. The extraction involves treating a hair sample, for example, with a gel that dissolves the hair, and a primer specifically developed to help locate characteristics like eye color or gender along the [[genome]].&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ben|title=Artist stirs privacy debate with portraits from DNA|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2013/07/02/artist-stirs-privacy-debate-with-portrai?videoId=243713123|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=Reuters|date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey-Hagborg might repeat this process up to 40 times,&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; looking for genetic variants influencing traits like eye color, hair color, and racial ancestry, in order to complete a portrait.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Artwork highlights legal debate over 'abandoned' DNA|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23677-artworks-highlight-legal-debate-over-abandoned-dna.html#.U-N6YUi9g7A|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=New Scientist|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the DNA strands are extracted from the samples, Dewey-Hagborg then amplifies, or copies, specific regions of the genome, using a technique called [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]], or PCR, a process advanced by [[Kary Mullis]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry (1993).&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; These amplified regions of the genome make it possible to identifying [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]], or SNPs (pronounced "snips"),&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; which contain variables in the base pairs that give clues to a person's individual genetic make up (e.g., whether or not a person's eyes might be blue, brown or green). These results are then sent for analysis to a company for sequencing. Dewey-Hagborg used [[23andMe]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; a DNA analysis service, for ''Stranger Visions''.

The genetic blueprint&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; she receives in return is a text file full of coded information identifying the unique positioning of the 4 [[nucleobase]]s [[adenine]], [[thymine]], [[cytosine]], and [[guanine]], or ATC and G, that make up the sections of the genome she is interested in.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; This data is then entered into a customized computer program she wrote.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt; The program interprets the code and provides her with a list of traits, including propensity for obesity, eye color, hair color, hair curl, skin tone, freckles, and gender.&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; She then takes these traits, as many as 50, and enters them into a face-generating program to configure the 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; Her previous experience with facial recognition algorithms gave her the ability to repurpose an existing [[facial recognition system|facial recognition program]], from [[Basel]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Walters, H."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=A Portrait from a Single Hair: The Work of Heather-Dewey Hagborg|url=http://ideas.ted.com/2013/06/20/generating-a-sculpture-from-a-hair-the-work-of-heather-dewey-hagborg/|website=Ideas.Ted.Com|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reworked the program to generate faces instead of just recognizing facial features.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; The resulting model changes facial dimensions (e.g., width of the nose and mouth) and characteristics with the genetic information it receives. Before making the final 3-D print,&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg generates several different versions of the face, finally choosing the one she finds most aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Kurt|title=Making Portraits out of DNA|url=http://www.studio360.org/story/267842-making-portraits-out-of-dna|website=Studio 360|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's ''Stranger Visions'' question whether or not the work crosses ethical and legal boundaries.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Who's looking through your discarded DNA?|journal=New Scientist|date=2013-06-15|volume=281|issue=2921|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make a distinction between an artist's right to express societal concerns through artwork and the act of collecting personal, genetic information without informed consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; The fact that DNA samples are regularly "left behind" or abandoned does not mean those people have relinquished their interest in how that information is used.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;

Some laws, like that of the [[Human Tissue Act of 2004]] in the United Kingdom, prohibit private individuals from collecting biological samples for DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; What laws that exist to regulate the collection and use of DNA samples in the United States are not consistent among the states and rarely address the private sector.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; Only some states, like New York, outlaw most DNA testing without written consent.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; Others worry about the misuse of the information, fearing discrimination based on existing medical or mental health issues or a predisposition for disease-related illnesses or "unreasonable" searches of DNA evidence by law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enserink, M."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enserink|first1=Martin|title=Emerging Forensics Field May Hit Legal and Ethical Obstacles|journal=Science|date=February 18, 2011|volume=331|doi=10.1126/science.331.6019.840|pages=840|pmid=21330505}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 7, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One scientist and one gallery, according to Dewey-Hagborg, turned down her proposal fearing the project would "cause a fright" among people.&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;

Other critics focus on the growing do-it-yourself or [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] movement. Supporters like Genspace's Ellen Jorgensen claim projects like ''Stranger Visions'' engage the public and make the new technology more accessible.&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."/&gt; Detractors fear unintended or unexpected consequences from unregulated experiments conducted by D.I.Y. amateur biologists developed in non-traditional laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Still others, including Daniel MacArthur, an assistant professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], [[John D. Hawks]], an anthropologist at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], Michelle N. Meyer, an academic fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology &amp; Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, and [[Arthur Caplan]], PhD, Director of the Division of Medical Ethics, N.Y.U., report that the technological capability to construct an accurate likeness of a human face based on DNA evidence is not currently available.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

Although it is possible to identify certain genetic markers linked to facial structures, scientists have yet to isolate all the genes and their variations needed to produce an accurate likeness with a computer simulation.&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; Meyer, who analyzed the data from Dewey-Hagborg's website concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far as I can tell, she's working with sex; ancestral groups that are usually very broad, and in any event only reflects half of the individual's DNA (from which she presumably guesses hair color and texture and bone structure); and a decent guess at eye color. There are hundreds of thousands (at least) of people who would fit these descriptions even if each of her phenotype predictions were accurate, and in many cases, one or more of the predictions are probably going to be wrong.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The environment, the probabilistic nature of interpreting the DNA data collected, and limitations of computer technology all influence the outcome.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She likens her work to that of a sketch artist.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; At most, her portraits bear only a vague, family resemblance to the people whose genetic information was used as a foundation for the portraits.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

===''A Becoming Resemblance''===
In the summer of 2017 Dewey-Hagborg's collaborative exhibition with transgender activist [[Chelsea E. Manning]] opened at Fridman Gallery. The exhibition was an iteration of the artist's successful and controversial ''Stranger Visions'' project.&lt;ref name="Kobler, J."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kobler|first1=Jason|title=Don't Give Your DNA to Giant Genetic Databases|work=Vice|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''A Becoming Resemblance'', Dewey-Hagborg created a series titled ''Radical Love'', 30 3-D printed portraits of Manning, based on cheek swabs and hair clippings that Manning sent her while incarcerated for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. While all 30 portraits were based on Manning's DNA, their variances in skin color and features presents the malleability of DNA data. The installation demonstrated how much the human genome is up for interpretation once condensed and subjectively interpreted.

In 2013, Dewey-Hagborg was contacted by an assistant medical examiner in Delaware,&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt; as a result of her work with ''Stranger Visions''. The project involved developing a portrait of an unidentified woman whose case has remained unsolved for 20 years. She agreed to be an adviser to assist with the case.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; Though the resulting portrait based on the unidentified woman's DNA could only be as accurate as existing technology allowed, leaving room for speculation, Dewey-Hagborg viewed working on the case as the only potential use for this type of face-generating technology.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; "If you can add anything at all to her description, if you can increase the possibility her loved ones may find her even one little bit I think it's worth it."&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's involvement in the Delaware case express concern for what they call "D.I.Y. forensic science" and question the role of civilians in state investigations.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Dewey-Hagborg's work with ''Stranger Visions'' and interest in issues surrounding genetic surveillance lead to the development of two products whose purpose is to eliminate DNA traces. The first, ''Erase'', is a bleaching spray that cleans surfaces (e.g., cups, silverware) of DNA evidence. The second, ''Replace'', is a spray consisting of a blend of genes designed to introduce foreign DNA evidence to the surface, therefore masking any of the original DNA remaining in that area.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg views these as a "citizens' defense against the looming DNA surveillance state."&lt;ref name="Hartnett, K."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartnett|first1=Kevin|title=How to cover your DNA trail|work=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Honour thy father and thy mother'''" is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The commandment is generally regarded in Protestant and Jewish sources as the fifth in both the list in Exodus 20:1–21, and in [[Deuteronomy]] (Dvarim) 5:1–23. Catholics count this as the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Ten Commandments,’’ ''New Bible Dictionary'', Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174–1175&lt;/ref&gt;

These commandments were enforced as law in many jurisdictions, and are still considered enforceable law by some.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard A., ''How Judges Think'', Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W., ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1988, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. Rodman. ''Renewal theology: systematic theology from a charismatic perspective'', 1996 p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jersild, Paul T., ''Making moral decisions: a Christian approach to personal and social ethics'', 1991, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20, 1 describes the Ten Commandments as being spoken by [[God]], inscribed on two stone tablets by the [[finger of God (Commandments)|finger of God]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100227061818/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church]'', §2056, 2003, Doubleday Religion, {{ISBN|0-385-50819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; broken by [[Moses]], and rewritten on replacement stones by the Lord.

==Hebrew Bible==
{{quote|Honour your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land [[YHWH|the {{LORD}}]] your God is giving you.|Exodus 20:12 (NIV)}}
In the [[Torah]], keeping this commandment was associated with individual benefit&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=2&amp;c=20 read online] and on Ephesians 6:1–4 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=49&amp;c=6 read online] (both accessed 31 August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20:12, ''The Jewish Study Bible: Tanakh Translation'', Berlin, Adele; Brettler, Marc Zvi, and Fishbane, Michael, eds.  Oxford University Press. 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-529751-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="See also Deuteronomy 6:3-4"&gt;See also Deuteronomy 6:3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Dishonouring parents by striking or cursing them was punishable by death&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17, Leviticus 20:9.  See also Deuteronomy 27:16 and Proverbs 20:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and so the clause "so that you may live long" could be interpreted as "so that you are not put to death".  In the [[Talmud]], the commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honoring God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim,  Mamrim 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:1&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Malachi]], God makes the analogy himself:
{{quote|
"A son honours his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honour due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?" says the LORD Almighty. "It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'"|Malachi 1:6 (NIV)}}

==Judaism==
{{quote| What constitutes "honour?" One must provide them with food and drink and clothing. One should bring them home and take them out, and provide them with all their needs cheerfully. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:7}}

The commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for human owes his existence to his father and his mother.

{{quote|...Honor the body that bore thee, and the breasts that gave thee suck, maintain thy parents, for thy parents took part in thy creation." For man owes his existence to God, to his father, and to his mother, in that he receives from each of his parents five of the parts of his body, and ten from God. The bones, the veins, the nails, the brain, and the white of the eye come from the father. The mother gives him skin, flesh, blood, hair, and the pupil of the eye. God gives him the following: breath, soul, light of countenance, sight, hearing, speech, touch, sense, insight, and understanding...but if people do not honor their parents, God say: "It is good that I do not dwell among men, or they would have treated Me superciliously, too."&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20OTHER%20COMMANDMENTS%20REVEALED%20ON%20SINAI Vol III : The Other Commandments Revealed On Sinai]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt; | ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol. III}}

The Talmud says that since there are three partners in the creation of a person (God and two parents), honour showed to parents is the same as honour shown to God.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Kiddushin 31&lt;/ref&gt; It also compares a number of similarly constructed passages from the Torah and concludes that honour toward parents and honour toward God are intentionally equated:
{{quote| Our Rabbis taught: It says, 'Honour your father and your mother' (Exodus 20:12), and it says, 'Honor God with your wealth' (Proverbs 3:9). By using the same terminology, the Torah compares the honour you owe your father and mother to the honour you have to give to the Almighty. It also says, 'Every person must respect his mother and his father' (Leviticus 19:3), and it says, 'God your Lord you shall respect, Him you shall serve' (Deuteronomy 10:20). Here the same word, respect, is used. The Torah equates the respect you owe your parents with the respect you must show God. Furthermore it says, 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death' (Exodus 21:17). And furthermore it says, 'Anyone that curses God shall bear his sin' (Leviticus 24.–15). By using the same terms the Torah compares cursing of parents with cursing the Almighty.&lt;ref&gt;(see also Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:1 and Sefer Maalot ha Middot)&lt;/ref&gt; | Talmud Kiddushin 31 }}

Because honouring parents is part of honouring God, the [[mitzvah]] does not depend on the worthiness of the parent:"Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father." (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25)

It also requires honour to one's [[stepparent]]s&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:19&lt;/ref&gt; or an older sibling who is raising one,&lt;ref&gt;Plaut, W.

The commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:11; Deuteronomy 5:16; Leviticus 19:3;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical beliefs===
Keeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="See also Deuteronomy 6:3-4"/&gt; According to the [[Torah]], striking or cursing one’s father or mother was punishable by immediate death.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17, Leviticus 20:9.  See also Deuteronomy 27:16 and Proverbs 20:20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Deuteronomy]], a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18–21. Note that the reference to the son being a drunkard would suggest that he is not a small child.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honouring one's parents is also described in the Torah as an analogue to honouring God.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20:12, ''The Jewish Study Bible: Tanakh Translation''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Jeremiah]], God refers to himself as Father to Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 31:9&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the prophet [[Isaiah]], God refers to Israel as his sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 43:6&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Malachi]], God calls for similar honour.&lt;ref&gt;Malachi 1:6 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeremiah, God blessed the descendants of [[Rechabite|Rechab]]&lt;ref&gt;This family is first introduced in 2 Kings 10:15–31&lt;/ref&gt; for obeying their forefather's command to not drink wine and uses the family as a counterexample to Israel's failure to obey his command to not worship other gods:  {{quote|"Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?" declares the LORD. "Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.  Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, 'Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your fathers.' But you have not paid attention or listened to me. The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me." |Jeremiah 35:12–16 (NIV)}}

===Precedence===
According to the [[Mishneh Torah]] this commandment requires one to honour both of one's parents equally; there is no greater weight given to either the father or the mother. While in some parts of scripture, father is stated first, in others, mother comes first. This shows that the honour due to each is equal.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 240:14&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jewish teaching holds that a married woman must honour her husband, there are also guidelines for how she may continue to honour her parents:
{{quote| It is the duty of both men and women to honour their parents. However, a married woman, who owes devotion to her husband, is exempt from the precept of honouring her parents. Yet, she is obliged to do for the parents, all she can, if her husband does not object. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:17}}

===Requirements===
The commandment requires one to obey one's parents when the command given by a parent is reasonable and permissible under Jewish law. For example, if a parent asks a child to bring him/her water, he/she must obey.  Because honouring God is above all mitzvot, if a parent asks a child to break a [[halakha|law of the Torah]], s/he must refuse to obey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
{{quote| Everything that your father says to you, you are obliged to obey.  But if he says to you: "Let us bow down to idols", you must not obey him, lest you become an apostate. | Midrash, Yalkut Shimoni, Proverbs 960}}

{{quote| I am the Lord your God, and both you and your parents are equally bound to honour Me, therefore, you must not hearken to them to disregard My word. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:15}}

A child is not required to obey if a parent says that s/he must marry a particular person, or must not marry a person s/he wishes to marry, provided the marriage is permissible by Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, ''The Jewish Book of Etiquette'' (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donin, Hayim Halevy. ''To be a Jew: A Guide to Jewish Observance in Contemporary Life''.  (p. 129) 1991 Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-08632-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ak6-iopHKaMC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=Honor+your+father+and+your+mother&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html view on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A child who is travelling has an obligation to communicate with his/her parents to let them know s/he is safe in order to prevent them from worrying.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Chassidim 542 in Finkel, Avraham Yaakov. 1997 ''Sefer Chasidim: The Book of the Pious'' Jason Aaronson {{ISBN|1-56821-920-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A child must continue to honour his/her parent after their deaths. This can be done by reciting [[kaddish]] for 11 months and on the [[yarzeit]] (anniversary of the parent's death), and by donating charity in the memory of the parent. The study of Torah is also considered to be reverence toward a parent, for it shows that a parent raised a worthy child.{{sfn|Donin, p. 129}}

A child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent.{{sfn|Donin, p. 129}} A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother.{{sfn|Isaacs, pp. 134–135}} A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.&lt;ref&gt;''The Little Midrash Says'', Volume III, The Book of Vayikra, by M. Weissman, C 1988, page 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In the gospels, [[Jesus]] affirmed the importance of honouring one's father and mother (Matthew 15:1–9, Matthew 19:17–19, Mark 10:17–19, Luke 18:18–21) [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] quotes the commandment in his letter to the church in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesus]]:
{{quote|Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. "Honour your father and mother" (this is the first commandment with a promise), "that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land." (Ephesians 6:1–2, ESV. See also Colossians 3:20)| Ephesians 6:1–2 (ESV)}}

In his letters to the [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], Paul describes disobedience to parents as a serious sin (Romans 1:29–31, 2 Timothy 3:2).

The words of Jesus and the teaching of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their parents by claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3–8, Mark 7:9–12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the [[Gospel of John]], when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted.&lt;ref name=erlc/&gt;

According to the gospel of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], the obligation to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and the primacy of the first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does ''not'' include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on Exodus 20:12–17 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=2&amp;c=20 read online] (accessed 31 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIV Study Bible. 1999. Zondervan. Note on Colossians 3:20 with reference to Acts 5:29&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's instructions to Timothy regarding the physical care of widows include the following:
{{quote|But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.|1 Timothy 5:4 (NIV)}}

==Christian==

===Catholicism===
The import of honouring father and mother is based on the divine origin of the parental role:
{{quote|The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood. (Ephesians 3:14) This is the foundation of the honour owed to parents. ... It is required by God's commandment. (Exodus 20:12) Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude toward those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought their children into the world and enabled them to grow in stature, wisdom, and grace.{{sfn|CCC §§2214–2215}}}}

According to the teachings of the Catholic Church, the commandment to honour father and mother reveals God's desired order of charity – first God, then parents, then others.{{sfn|CCC §2197}} Keeping the commandment to honour father and mother brings both spiritual and temporal rewards of peace and prosperity, while failure to honor parents harms the individual as well as society.{{sfn|CCC §2200}} The pervasive societal effect of obedience or disobedience to this command is attributed to the status of the family as the fundamental building block of society:
{{quote|The family is the original cell of social life. ...Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society. The family is the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values, begin to honour God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society.{{sfn|CCC §2207}}}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a child in the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, excluding immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching.{{sfn|CCC §2217}} "Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'" (Proverbs 6:20–22){{sfn|CCC §2216}}

The Church teaches that adult children have a duty to honour their parents by providing "material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress".{{sfn|CCC §2218}} This honour should be based on the son or daughter's gratitude for the life, love and effort given by the parents and motivated by the desire to pay them back in some measure.{{sfn|CCC §2215}}

The principle of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers.{{sfn|CCC §2199}} The commandment to honour father and mother also forms a basis for charity to others when each person is seen, ultimately, as "a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called 'our Father'."{{sfn|CCC §2212}} Thus, charitable actions are viewed as extensions of the honour owed to the heavenly Father.

===Orthodox Church===
Father Seraphim Stephens sees "Honor" defined as "Love and Respect", and notes that this commandment is positioned between those that address one's obligations to God and those that relate to how one treats others. "It clearly lays the foundation of our relationship to God and to all other people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roca.org/OA/142/142m.htm Stephens, Seraphim. "Honor thy Father and thy Mother", Orthodox America, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; Richard D. Andrews points out that, "Every time we do something good, just, pure, holy, we bring honor to our parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles7/AndrewsParents.php Andrews, Richard Demetrius. "Honor thy Father and Mother", ''Orthodoxy Today'', June 2, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[John Calvin]] describes the sacred origin of the role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood.  Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion "absurd".&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. ''Harmony of the Law, Part III'', Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Since, therefore, the name of Father is a sacred one, and is transferred to men by the peculiar goodness of God, the dishonouring of parents redounds to the dishonour of God Himself, nor can any one despise his father without being guilty of an offence against God, (sacrilegium.) If any should object that there are many ungodly and wicked fathers whom their children cannot regard with honour without destroying the distinction between good and evil, the reply is easy, that the perpetual law of nature is not subverted by the sins of men; and therefore, however unworthy of honour a father may be, that he still retains, inasmuch as he is a father, his right over his children, provided it does not in anywise derogate from the judgement of God; for it is too absurd to think of absolving under any pretext the sins which are condemned by His Law; nay, it would be a base profanation to misuse the name of father for the covering of sins.&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; | John Calvin, commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16}}

The commentary of [[John Wesley]] on the commandment to honour father and mother is consistent with the interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, John. Notes on the Bible: Notes on the Second Book of Moses, commentary on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/notes.ii.iii.xxi.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Ex.xxi.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, "Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?" This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 6:6 and 1 Timothy 5:17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Henry]] explains that the commandment to honour father and mother applies not only to biological parents but also to those who fulfill the role of mother or father. He uses the example of [[Esther]] honouring her guardian and cousin Mordecai:
{{quote|Mordecai being Esther's guardian or pro-parent, we are told ... How respectful she was to him. Though in relation she was his equal, yet, being in age and dependence his inferior, she honoured him as her father—did his commandment, v. 20. This is an example to orphans; if they fall into the hands of those who love them and take care of them, let them make suitable returns of duty and affection. The less obliged their guardians were in duty to provide for them the more obliged they are in gratitude to honour and obey their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry's Commentary on Esther Chapter 2 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc2.xvii.iii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; | Matthew Henry, commentary on Esther 2}}

[[File:Esther Mordechai Purim.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Esther and Mordecai writing the second letter of Purim. Arent de Gelder, ca. 1685. Oil on canvas, RISD Museum of Art, Providence RI]]

The commandment itself encourages obedience "so that you may enjoy long life and that it may go well with you".&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 5:16&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry, Wesley and Calvin affirm the applicability of this promise for all who keep the commandment, though each notes that for the New Testament Christian, the promise may be fulfilled as earthly rewards and/or heavenly rewards, as God sees fit in his wisdom and love for the individual.

In his commentary, Calvin notes the harsh consequences required in Exodus and Leviticus for specific failures to keep the commandment. Those who struck or cursed a parent were to be sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17 and Leviticus 20:9&lt;/ref&gt; Persistently disobedient sons were to be brought before the city elders and stoned by the whole community if the parents' testimony was judged to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Calvin writes that God knew capital punishment for these offences would seem harsh and be difficult to pronounce, even for those responsible for adjudicating the situation. This is why, he argues, the text specifically places responsibility for the consequences on the offender. The severity of the sentence emphasized the importance of removing such behaviour from the community and deterring others who might imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 21:15, 17 and Leviticus 20:9 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Calvin refers mostly to fathers in his commentary on the commandment to honour father and mother, he writes near the beginning that the commandment mentions both parents on purpose.&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; As described above, Proverbs supports the value of guidance from both father and mother,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 6:20–22&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul specified  that children should provide for their own widowed mothers and grandmothers, “which is pleasing to God.”&lt;ref&gt;1 Timothy 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as "honor" involves offering profound respect, the opposite of honoring someone is to trivialize him, as if of no importance.&lt;ref name=erlc&gt;[http://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/honor-your-father-and-mother "Honor your father and mother", The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Respect is not something based solely on personal or professional qualifications, but also on the position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.&lt;ref name=erlc/&gt;

==Rewards for compliance==
This commandment is distinct from the others in that a promise is attached to it: "...so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you."&lt;ref&gt;Plaut and Stein,''The Torah: A Modern Commentary''(p. 504)&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 5:16 amplifies this: "...that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jba.gr/Articles/jba2004_06.htm Kioulachoglou, Anastasios. "Honor your father and mother", ''Journal of Bible Accuracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of disobedience==
As with most terms of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] between God and Israel, there are consequences for disobedience as well as rewards for obedience:
{{quote | Just as the reward for honouring father and mother is very great, the punishment for transgressing it is very great. And the one who afflicts his parents causes the shechinah [presence of God] to separate from him and harsh decrees fall upon him and he is given many sufferings. And even if life smiles on him in this life, he will surely be punished in the World to Come. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:4}}

'''Idam'''([[Tamil language|Tamil]]) ([[Sanskrit]]: इदम् or अयम् or इयम्) is a Tamil/Sanskrit word which denotes location or position or place. In grammar it is used at the beginning or middle of a sentence as a nominative or attributive pronoun, combined with or without ''ya'', adds emphasis to other nouns, propositions etc.; and means - this, here or yonder, present or seen nearby, fit for, or without reference to noun refers to एतद् ('that') or to what precedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman shivraman Apte|publisher=University of Chicago|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=Idam&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (Sloka XVI.13), in the phrase – इदम् अस्तीदम् अपि मे the word, ''idam'', has been used to mean 'this', "this it is, this also mine",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavad Gita|publisher=SUNY Press|page=622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JoicgCMZ5cC&amp;pg=PA622&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WjTqUvGZGOSo4ASqkYH4Bw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (Stanza I.i.10) in the phrase – पर्याप्तं त्विदम् एतेषां, meaning "sufficient though that of these", ''idam'' used as  एतद् refers to 'that', whereas (in Stanza. II.5.9) in the phrase – अयम् स्तनयित्नुः, meaning "Thunder is Vayu", ''ayam'' refers to 'is'. In the phrase – ब्रह्म इदम् सर्वं, which means - "[[Brahman]] possessing all the qualities is all-pervading", the word ''idam'' is used in the sense of 'it is', the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is identified with ''idam sarvam'' and the same phrase also expresses the whole world because the world springs from the Atman as is indicated in Stanza V.iii.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad |publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=58,223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sIq2gHSxgkC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WjTqUvGZGOSo4ASqkYH4Bw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Vedas]], ''idam'' as ''ayam'' has been used as a subject in nominal sentences as an equivalent of a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nominal Sentence in Sanskrit and Indo-Aryan|author=Andries Breunis|publisher=BRILL|pages=66|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6-QNYBfzfgQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WjTqUvGZGOSo4ASqkYH4Bw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connotation==

In Pada 32 of Book II Ch.IV of his [[Ashtadhyayi]] [[Pāṇini]], who states that words apply per object, explains that: 
इदमोऽन्वादेशेऽशनुदात्त तृत्यादौ ||
in the room of ''idam'' 'this', in case of its re-employment in a subsequent member of the same sentence and referring to the same thing (''anvadesha'' i.e. ''[[adesha]]'' after re-employment) there is the substitution of as’ which is a ''anudatta'' i.e. gravely accented, when the third case-affix and the rest follow. That means – अ replaces इदम् in all cases except the nominative and the accusative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadhyati of Panini|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=322|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TbzVy6vqyCkC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;lpg=PA322&amp;dq=idam+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7x1Xae3Gj5&amp;sig=g3ypbj7NFJH2jxyHzeRHdzYKeOc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MpjrUuPrFYGAhAfJqoGQBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=idam%20panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context Katayayana stipulates that one should specify a pronominal used in subsequently referring to something should be co-referential with a previously used term because replacement by an anaphoric pronoun should not possibly be allowed where there is not co-reference.  And, with regard to ''taddhita'' affixation abstract patterns like ''tasya idam'' ('prescribing a genitive relationship'), ''tad asmin'' ('prescribing a locative relationship') and ''tat karoti'' ('prescribing an action meaning involving an accusative relationship') have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recent Research in Paninian Studies|author=George Cardona|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=225, 124|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5MOEttrZhbcC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=idam+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cdss01WnlR&amp;sig=W7zNF9X1ngc8hkKiJ0ScjPNwj1Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MpjrUuPrFYGAhAfJqoGQBA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=idam%20panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genitive form of ''idams'' is explained as a ''sthaneyoga sasthi'' (Pada I.i.49) and the locative form is explained as ''parasaptami''  when a case ending beginning with the instrumental case endings follows. A substitute which has s’ as an it-letter replaces the whole of the original form which step requires an ''anubandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=51|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ELHsQH9aQsQC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDLqUujPKsrQ4QTezYCADA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaiyata tells us that words with ''Krta'' and ''Tadditha'' affixes denoting ''bhava'' ('being') extended for ''bhava'' to mean ''dravya'' ('object') would result in ''dravya'', a pronoun, referring to anything not specified i.e. to an individual object or locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy|author=Peter M.Scharf|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=etad+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PvpUTb__e4&amp;sig=RFIEvLaffRWKOMYDz65DPDtntPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nWjsUvfSOpDd7QaApoHIAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Patanjali]] the verb as’ means - ''bhava'' or ''kriya''. The term, ''Kriyadharma'' ('the properties of an action'), is also used in contrast with the terms ''dravyadharma'' and ''sattvadharma''; and Helaraja states that which has the latter two is something that can be referred to by demonstratives such as ''idam'' ('this') and ''tad'' ('that').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Process and Language: A study of Mahabhashya|author=Hideyo Ogawa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tc1dP2WB4sC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=etad+panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZdvDx7Ze8h&amp;sig=DQ-XOMyQkQcSss6oCpe4yczpRLI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nWjsUvfSOpDd7QaApoHIAw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=etad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pali]] language, ''Ida'' and ''Idam'' are accusative singular neuters as is the original ''etad'' or ''eghad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Gandhari Ekottarikagama-type Sutras|author=Mark Allon|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoV5Dz20oo4C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TbqUpGPF8rw4QTS_ICgDA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature ''idam'' refers to land, landscape or place, which word is one of the six forming the three sets of oppositions; ''idam'' pairs in opposition with ''kalam'' ('time') i.e. ''idavakupeyar'' that gives name to a place or to something in or from that place, and ''kalavakupeyar'' which applies the name of a time or season to something that occurs in time and season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tamil Oratory and Dravidian Aesthetics|author=Bernard Bate|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=100, 103, 191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uP7LHS3cDMC&amp;pg=PT127&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TbqUpGPF8rw4QTS_ICgDA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBTg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minard (according to whose criteria repetition would imply an adverb and a declined form indicates a pronoun) considers ''idam'' in the phrase ''idam sarvam'' as an adverb but ''idam'' of the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] ( Stanza 7.4.1.25) firstly implies the article and thereafter 'the All', the Absolute totality which removes the anti-thesis of ''ayam'' ('this') and ''asau'' ('yonder world').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jaiminiya Brahmana I, 1-65|author=H.W.Bodewitz|author-link=Henk Bodewitz|publisher=BRILL|page=167 Notes St.53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuMUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6jDqUpjYGIHs4wSbtoGABg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhvacharya]] consistent with [[Samkhya|Samkhya philosophy]] and [[Sayana]] with [[Advaita Vedanta]], take ''idam'' occurring in the first line – न वि जानामि यदिवेदमस्मि निण्यः संनध्दो मनसा चरामि in Mantra I.164.37 of the [[Rig Veda]] to mean 'the Universe' instead of its adverbial meaning "here", where the word ''samnaddho'' means ignorance rather than scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge|author=K.N.Jayatilleke|publisher=Routledge|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pBTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDLqUujPKsrQ4QTezYCADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic elucidation==

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]’s and the post-Vedic use of ''idam'' and ''tad'' refers to the Absolute or Brahman or "the All" i.e. to that which the [[Vedic]] sages sought to clarify. The ''idam'' occurring in the beginning of Rig Veda mantra X.135.7 refers to the seat of [[Yama]] where is heard the sound of Yama’s flute which no mortal can resist.  ''Idam'' is the nominative singular neuter demonstrative pronouns, Being and Non-being the singular subject which is one without a second, in which condition it applies to anything falling within the range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mantramanjari|author=Raimundo Panikkar|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=159, 533, 656|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M01LSxaneasC&amp;pg=PA656&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SDLqUujPKsrQ4QTezYCADA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita elucidation==

According to [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], ''aham'' (I-sense secured in introspection, ''visayi'') and ''idam'' (thou-sense sense secured in extrospection, ''visaya'') are polarly related, they are as opposed as light and darkness. ''Idam Brahman'' refers to ''etadakshara'' - [[Brahman]] as the objective unity and the ''tadakshara'' – Brahman refers to the subject, the Atman i.e. Brahman as Itself, which cannot be an object matter of ''pramana-jnana'' since the Atman is non-dual and does not have the knowing and the known in it. Reality is to be cognized objectively as an ''idam'' as the goal by looking inwards otherwise the ''vidhi-vakyas'' would serve no purpose. Beyond "I" is not any person knower or doer but the transcendental ground of "I", the unspeakable; the indeterminate cannot be spoken about directly. Sankara condemns [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] or [[Adhyasa]], the wrong apprehension of a content where it is not nor can ever be, which the true knowledge of ''idam'' or Brahman alone can eradicate. The ''idam'' aspect of ''[[ahamkara]]'' reflected by the light of the pure self becomes the object of the "I-sense". Brahman cannot be known in the objective attitude as an object somewhere in the beyond as an ''idam''. Advaita Vedanta holds Brahman as the Atman and Brahman as ''idam sarvam'' ("all this").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|pages=37, 368,180, 33,70,332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=idam+vedanta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuI-maAuKO&amp;sig=IhbzHk-8lHD8bgwJPLht6bf-PK0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kWvsUv-_EMSI7AbWv4GYDA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=idam%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga and Shaivite elucidation==

The [[Yoga]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] considers the Individual Self inseparable from and identical with the Universal Self. [[Shiva]] represents the supreme consciousness Brahman; the subject (consciousness) which is the positive ''Shiva-tattva'' is called ''aham'' and the object ('power of consciousness') which is the negative ''Shakti-tattva'' is called ''idam''('this'), the former which pervades the thirty-five ''tattvas''  being passive is dependent on Shakti (''idam'') for creation to occur. The three principal modes of Shakti are ''iccha-shakti'' ('will power'), ''jnana-shakti'' ('power of knowledge') and ''kriya-shakti'' ('power of action'). ''Sadashiva-tattva'', which is the first thing with a cause, identified with ''iccha-shakti'' consists of both ''aham'', and ''idam'',  ''Ishvara-tattva'' identified with ''jnana-shakti'' accounts for ''aham'' recognizing ''idam'', and ''Sadvidya-tattva'' identified with ''kriya-shakti'' is the complete "subject-object unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring Chakras: Awaken your untapped energy|author=Susan G.Shumsky|publisher=Career Press|pages=92–95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lr-hnUVcoyQC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8DXqUqioAsrw4QTS_ICgDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Cit-shakti'', ''Ananda-shakti'', ''Iccha-shakti'', ''Jnana-shakti'' and ''Kriya-shakti'' the ''svatantraya'' of Shiva is reflected. ''Shakti-tattva'' too is a reflection of ''Shiva-shakti''. The four ''tattvas'' are not created by the energies of Shiva but are an expression or ''ushma'' ("heat") of His true nature. ''Suddhavidya'' is the real state of Shiva or the state of ''aham aham-idam ida'', [[Ishvara]] which is the state of ''idam-aham'', ''Sadashiva'' is the state of ''aham-idam'' and ''Shakti'' is the state of ''aham''. In the first section of ''aham aham-idam idam'', ''aham aham'' signifies the stable state associated with one’s cognition of the real nature of Self, the truth of this universe, and the second section ''idam idam'' signifies the unstable state when one experiences the universe is false and unreal. The fourth energy called the ''pralayakala pramatri shakti'' makes one reside in the state of ''Suddhavidya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme|author=Swami Lakshman|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=21–23, 53–55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Dbf8VHcPoGMC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EIPrUozjI5LwhQfg-IHoBg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]] defines ''sristi'' ("Creation") as the act of the Supreme Lord making ''idam'' ('object') appear through self-manifestation in the back-ground of ''akasha'' (void or space) created by self-limitation or self-negation. Here ''Idam'' signifies the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]] which ''Idamta'' though not different from ''Ahamta'' is not eternal; the self-experience of ''Ahamta'' prevails over the self-experience of indistinct ''Idamta'' which disappears on attaining the ''stithi'' state – ''aham eva idam'' ("I am all this"). ''Idamta'', a self-extension, aids in the realization of ''Paramshiva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sadhana|author=Debabrata Sen Sharma|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=23–27, 36|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yzXDIG-XWHkC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Idam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3I7rUuTPNYOThgep8YB4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Idam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bois-Reymond.jpg|thumb|[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], (1818–1896), promulgator of the maxim ''ignoramus et ignorabimus.'' (Heliogravure of a painting &lt;br /&gt; by [[Max Koner]].]]

The [[Latin]] maxim '''''ignoramus et ignorabimus''''', meaning "we do not know and will not know", represents the idea that [[scientific knowledge]] is limited. It was publicized, in this sense, by [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], a German [[physiologist]], in his publication ''Über die Grenzen des Naturerkennens'' ("On the limits of our understanding of nature") of 1872.

== Seven World Riddles ==

[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the phrase ''ignoramus et ignorabimus'' while discussing what he termed [[Emil du Bois-Reymond#The Seven World Riddles|seven "world riddles"]], in a famous 1880 speech before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].

He defined seven "world riddles", of which three, he declared, neither science nor philosophy could ever explain, because they are "[[Transcendence (philosophy)#Kant (and modern philosophy)|transcendent]]". Of the riddles, he considered the following transcendental and declared of them ''ignoramus et ignorabimus:''&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leverette Jr., ''E. L. Youmans' Crusade for Scientific Autonomy and Respectability'', American Quarterly, Vol. 17, No. 1. (Spring, 1965), pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
"1. the ultimate nature of matter and force, 2. the origin of motion, ... 5. the origin of simple [[Sense|sensations]], a quite transcendent question."

== Hilbert's reaction ==

[[David Hilbert]], a widely-respected German mathematician, suggested that such a conceptualization of human knowledge and ability is too pessimistic, and that by considering questions unsolvable, we limit our understanding.

In 1900, during an address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, Hilbert suggested that answers to problems of mathematics are possible with human effort.  He declared, "In mathematics there is no ''ignorabimus''.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=D. Hilbert |title=Mathematical Problems: Lecture Delivered before the International Congress of Mathematicians at Paris in 1900 |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=8 |year=1902 |pages=437–79 |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3 | mr = 1557926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he worked with other [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]]s to establish [[foundations of mathematics#foundation crisis|foundations for mathematics]] during the early 20th century.

On 8 September 1930, [[Hilbert]] elaborated his opinion in a celebrated address to the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, in [[Königsberg]]:&lt;ref name=speech_hilbert_1930/&gt;

{{Cquote|We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ''ignorabimus''. For us there is no ''ignorabimus'', and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ''ignorabimus'' our slogan shall be: ''Wir müssen wissen — wir werden wissen.''&lt;ref name=wissen/&gt; ('We must know - we will know.')}}

Answers to some of Hilbert's Program of [[Hilbert's problems|23 problems]] were found during the 20th century.  Some have been answered definitively; some have not yet been solved; a few have been shown to be impossible to answer with mathematical rigor. 

During 1931, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] showed that answers to some mathematical questions cannot be answered in the manner we would usually prefer.

== Sociological responses ==
The [[sociologist]] [[Wolf Lepenies]] has discussed the ''ignorabimus'' with the opinion that du Bois-Reymond was not really pessimistic about science:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepenies|first=Wolf|authorlink=Wolf Lepenies|title=Between Literature and Science: the Rise of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-33810-7|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|—it is in fact an incredibly self-confident support for scientific hubris masked as modesty—}}

This is in a discussion of [[Friedrich Wolters]], one of the members of the literary group "[[George-Kreis]]". Lepenies comments that Wolters misunderstood the degree of pessimism being expressed about science, but well understood the implication that scientists themselves could be trusted with self-criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">In [[mathematics]], an '''induced homomorphism''' is a structure-preserving [[map (mathematics)|map]] between a pair of objects that is derived in a canonical way from another map between another pair of objects.

==In topology==
A particularly important case arises in [[algebraic topology]], where any [[continuous function]] between two [[Pointed space|pointed topological space]]s induces a [[group homomorphism]] between the [[fundamental group]]s of the two spaces. (See section III.5.4, p.&amp;nbsp;201, in H. Schubert.)
&lt;ref name="Sb"&gt;
{{cite book|
author=Schubert, H.|
year=1975| 
title=Topologie, Eine Einführung (Mathematische Leitfäden)|
publisher=B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, the same continuous map induces a group homomorphism between the respective [[homotopy group]]s, the respective [[homology group]]s (IV.1.3, pp.&amp;nbsp;240–241) &lt;ref name="Sb"/&gt; and a homomorphism going in the opposite direction between the corresponding [[cohomology group]]s (IV.4.2–3, pp.&amp;nbsp;298–299).&lt;ref name="Sb"/&gt;

==Categorization==
A [[homomorphism]] is a structure-preserving map between two mathematical objects of the same type: a [[group homomorphism]], for instance, is a map between two [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] such that the image of the product of any two group items is the same as the product of their images, while a [[graph homomorphism]] is a map from the vertices of one [[undirected graph]] to the vertices of another such that any edge of the first graph is mapped to an edge of the second. Families of objects, and maps between them, are generally formalized as [[object (category theory)|object]]s and [[morphism]]s in a [[category theory|category]]; by convention, the morphisms in categories are depicted as arrows in diagrams. In many of the
important categories of mathematics, the morphisms are called homomorphisms. In category theory, a [[functor]] is itself a structure-preserving map, between categories: it must map objects to objects, and morphisms to morphisms, in a way that is compatible with the composition of morphisms within the category. 
&lt;ref name="Pa"&gt;
{{cite book|
author=Pareigis, B.|
year=1969| 
title=Kategorien und Funktoren (Mathematische Leitfäden)|
publisher=B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
If ''F'' is a functor from category ''A'' to category ''B'', ƒ is a morphism in category ''A'', and the morphisms of category ''B'' are called homomorphisms, then ''F''(ƒ) is the homomorphism induced from ƒ by ''F''.

==Examples==
For example, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces with fundamental groups π(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and π(''Y'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively, with specified [[pointed space|base points]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If ƒ is a continuous function from ''X'' to ''Y'' that maps the base points to each other (that is, ƒ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) then any [[Loop group|loop]] based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; may be composed with ƒ to make a loop based at ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This map of loops respects [[homotopy equivalence]] of loops: one can map any element of π(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to π(''Y'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) by choosing a loop representing the element, using ƒ to map that representative loop to ''Y'', and selecting the homotopy equivalence class of the resulting mapped loop. Thus, ƒ corresponds to a homomorphism of fundamental groups; this homomorphism is called the induced homomorphism of ƒ. 
&lt;ref name="Sb"/&gt;
The construction of a fundamental group for each topological space, and of an induced homomorphism of fundamental groups for each continuous function, forms a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of groups. See [[fundamental group#Functoriality]] for more on this type of induced homomorphism.

[[Image:Information-integration.svg|right|thumb|400px|Schematic diagram of information integration theory]]
'''Information integration theory''' was proposed by [[Norman H. Anderson]] to describe and model how a person integrates information from a number of sources in order to make an overall judgment. The theory proposes three functions.

The ''valuation function'' &lt;math&gt;V(S)&lt;/math&gt; is an empirically derived mapping of stimuli to an interval scale. It is unique up to an interval transformation (&lt;math&gt; y = ax + b &lt;/math&gt;).

The ''integration function'' &lt;math&gt; r = I\{s_1,s_2, .., s_n\}&lt;/math&gt;  is an algebraic function combining the subjective values of the information. "Cognitive algebra" refers to the class of functions that are used to model the integration process.  They may be adding, averaging, weighted averaging, multiplying, etc.

The ''response production function'' &lt;math&gt;R = M(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the process by which the internal impression is translated into an overt response.

Information integration theory differs from other theories in that it is not erected on a consistency principle such as balance or congruity but rather relies on algebraic models.
The theory is also referred to as functional measurement, because it can provide validated scale values of the stimuli. 
An elementary treatment of the theory, along with a Microsoft Windows program for carrying out functional measurement analysis, is provided in the textbook by David J. Weiss.

== Integration models ==
There are three main types of algebraic models used in information integration theory: adding, averaging, and multiplying.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Adding models'''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;R =&lt;/math&gt; reaction/overt behavior
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;F/G =&lt;/math&gt; contributing factors

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_1 = F_1 + G_1&lt;/math&gt; (Condition 1)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_2 = F_2 + G_2&lt;/math&gt; (Condition 2)

Typically an experiment is designed so that: 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_1=R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;F_1&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;, so that
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two special cases known as discounting and augmentation. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Discounting''': The value of any factor is reduced if other factors that produce the same effect are added.
&lt;br /&gt;Example: &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; is not present or has a value of zero. If &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is positive, then G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Augmentation''': An inverse version of the typical model.
&lt;br /&gt;Example: If &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is negative, then &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; must be greater than &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Two advantages of adding models; (1) Participants are not required to have an exact intuitive calculation, (2) The adding model itself need not be completely valid. Certain kinds of interaction among the factors would not affect the qualitative conclusions.

{{Nihongo|'''''Kamiza'''''|上座|}} is the  [[Japanese language]] term referring to the "top seat" within a room, meaning the place of honor; the term also applies to the best seats in air-planes, trains, and cars. The antonym, meaning "bottom seat," is ''shimoza'' (下座). In a room, the ''kamiza'' is the seat or position that is most comfortable, usually furthest from the door -- because this is warmest, and was safest from attack back in the [[History of Japan|feudal period]]. In a traditional ''[[washitsu]]'' room it would often be a ''[[zabuton]]'' placed so the person sitting there has his back to the ''[[tokonoma]]''; the ''kamiza'' is the spot closest to the ''tokonoma'' or simply farthest from the door in a room lacking a ''tokonoma''. In a  [[Western culture|Western]]-style room it would be a comfortable [[armchair (furniture)|armchair]] or [[sofa (furniture)|sofa]], or the head of a table. 
The term is general, and does not only apply to [[Etiquette in Japan|Japanese culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}

==Choosing a seat==
{{weasel|section|date=October 2012}}
When entering a room [[Culture of Japan|in Japan]] on a formal occasion, participants are expected to assume the correct seating position, and to leave the ''kamiza'' free for the most important person present, either a guest of honor or the person of highest rank. However, if one humbly sits somewhere indicative of lower status and is then encouraged by the host to move to the ''kamiza'', it is acceptable to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17720">{{EngTort}}
'''Loss of chance in English law''' refers to a particular problem of causation, which arises in tort and contract. The law is invited to assess hypothetical outcomes, either affecting the claimant or a third party, where the defendant's breach of [[contract]] or of the [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]] for the purposes of [[negligence]] deprived the [[claimant]] of the opportunity to obtain a benefit and/or avoid a loss. For these purposes, the remedy of [[damages]] is normally intended to compensate for the claimant's loss of expectation (alternative rationales include restitution and reliance). The general rule is that while a loss of chance is compensable when the chance was something promised on a contract&lt;ref&gt;see ''Chaplin v. Hicks''&lt;/ref&gt; it is not generally so in the law of tort, where most cases thus far have been concerned with medical negligence in the public health system.

==Contract==

===Remedies===
In contract cases, the [[court]] is usually interested in securing the performance of what was agreed. Where one party is about to or has suffered loss as a result of the other's breach, the court offers practical protection to his or her expectations as to performance (in some cases, the use of [[injunction]] or [[specific performance]] may be appropriate). Where a party proves that he or she has sustained loss flowing from any breach (potentially including non-pecuniary or intangible losses, e.g. for disappointment, damage to reputation, etc.), the purpose of damages is, so far as money can do it, to place the claimant in the same situation as if the contract had been performed. Thus, the most relevant basis upon which to calculate any loss is to examine the economic potential of the contract as worded. This will provide a measure of what the claimant expected to gain, and so quantify what has been lost by the breach.

===Public policy===
As a matter of [[public policy (law)|public policy]], the law aims to respect the reasonable expectations of all parties involved in the dispute. The fundamental approach is therefore to uphold the validity of the contract wherever possible. Thus, there is no general protection offered to those who find they have entered into a bad bargain. All must accept the real outcomes of agreements entered into voluntarily (see [[freedom of contract]]). Even when there is a breach, the court will not penalise the "guilty" party (see ''[[Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd]]'' [1909] AC 488 which prevents the award of punitive or exemplary damages in a purely contractual action), nor will it strip away all profits made at the expense of the other unless the breach is exceptional as in ''[[Attorney General v Blake]]'' [2000] 3 WLR 635 which appears to create a wholly novel form of contractual remedy, namely the restitutionary remedy of an [[account of profits]] for [[breach of contract]] where the normal remedies are inadequate. The standard remedy is damages which are usually calculated by reference to the claimant only and do not reflect any form of penalty on the other(s) for exploiting the gullibility or innocence of the claimant. The law also recognises that unfairness may flow from inequality in bargaining power and addresses oppressive exemption clauses.

===Causation===
The primary difficulty in the calculation of damages is the question of [[causation (law)|causation]]. [[Remoteness in English law|Remoteness]] will defeat a claim if it depends on very hypothetical possibilities. In ''[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]]'' relying on rumours, the Commission sold to McRae the right to salvage an oil tanker thought to be marooned at the specified location. Unfortunately, the tanker did not exist. The Commission argued the contract was void because of a common mistake as to the existence of the subject matter, but the court noted that the Commission "took no steps to verify what they were asserting and any 'mistake' that existed was induced by their own culpable conduct." McRae wasted money searching for the non-existent wreck. His claim for the loss of profits expected from a successful salvage was dismissed as too speculative, but reliance damages were awarded for wasted expenses.&lt;ref name="McRae v Commonwealth"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|79|1951|litigants=[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.pdf (1951) 84 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 377] |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the courts have been prepared to speculate. In ''Chaplin v Hicks'' (1911) 2 KB 786 the defendant in breach of contract prevented the claimant from taking part in the final stage of a beauty contest where twelve of the final fifty (out of 6,000 original entrants) would be rewarded with places in a chorus line. The claimant was awarded damages for the loss of a chance, assessed at 25% of winning the competition. The court seemed to proceed on the claimant's statistical chance of winning (as if she were a lottery player) without any actual assessment of her physical attributes against any particular criteria of beauty.

Yet ''[[Allied Maples Group Ltd v. Simmons &amp; Simmons]]'' [1995] 1 WLR 1602 has partly restricted ''[[Chaplin v. Hicks]]''. A solicitor's negligence deprived the claimant of an opportunity to negotiate a better bargain. The Court of Appeal held that if the client could show on the [[balance of probabilities]] that: (a) they would have sought renegotiation with the third party, and (b) that they had a substantial chance of negotiating (not necessarily that they would on balance of probabilities have negotiated) a better deal from the third party, then the court should quantify and award compensation for their loss of chance of doing so. [[Murray Stuart-Smith|Stuart-Smith LJ]], at p1611, accepted the 'loss of chance' approach and regarded the case as one of those where "the plaintiff's loss depends on the hypothetical action of a third party, either in addition to action by the plaintiff … or independently of it." This inclusion of a third party in the equation to quantify loss could have been taken as a general precondition to all claim of loss cases, but Lord Nicholls in ''[[Gregg v Scott]]'' [2005] UKHL 2 said, "It is clear that Stuart-Smith LJ. did not intend this to be a precise or exhaustive statement of the circumstances where loss of a chance may constitute actionable damage and his observation has not been so understood."&lt;ref name="Gregg v Scott"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Gregg v Scott]] |year=2005 |court=UKHL |num=2 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali]]'' [2002] 1 AC 251 an employee made redundant by BCCI, claimed the usual statutory payments and, under the aegis of [[Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service|ACAS]], signed an agreement to accept a sum "in full and final settlement of all or any claims of whatsoever nature that exist or may exist against BCCI." The House of Lords held that this exclusion clause did not prevent employees from reopening their agreements when, following BCCI's collapse, it became clear that a significant part of the bank's business had been run dishonestly and the employees found that they were stigmatised for having worked there. When the parties signed the release, they could not have realistically supposed that a claim for damages in respect of disadvantage and stigma was a possibility. Accordingly, they claimed they could not have intended the release to apply to such a claim. But in earlier proceedings on the question of damages, the formidable practical obstacles presented by the limiting principles of causation, remoteness, and the duty of the claimant to mitigate any losses proved insurmountable. In 1999 Lightman J. tried five representative cases out of the 369 which had been initiated by former BCCI employees. None of them succeeded in proving that their unemployment was attributable to stigma. Indeed, subject to the anti-discrimination laws, a prospective employer is under no particular duty to employ anyone who attends for interview. Four of the cases tried by Lightman J. appear to have concerned employees who were dismissed by the liquidators when the bank collapsed in 1991. Those made redundant in 1990 faced the additional hurdle of having to explain why their unemployment was attributable to stigma when they were unable to find jobs for a year before any stigma attached to them.

In this context, ''[[Johnson (A.P.) v. Unisys Limited]]'' [2001] UKHL 13 rejects any interpretation of ''[[Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd]]'' that might have prevented an action for damage to reputation or for psychiatric injury arising from dismissal, but confirms formidable evidential difficulties on causation: How, for example, would the employee prove that his psychiatric condition was caused by the manner of the dismissal rather than the fact of the dismissal which is within an employer's power for cause? More generally, the case holds that claims for breach of contractual terms cannot be used to avoid statutory preconditions to making claims for [[unfair dismissal]]. Recently, in ''[[Harper v. Virgin Net]]'' [2004] EWCA Civ 271 the Court of Appeal decided that an employee who was summarily dismissed, cannot bring a claim for damages for the loss of the opportunity to initiate a claim for unfair dismissal. If she had served the minimum three-month period of notice stipulated in the contract, she would have been able to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. But although there was a breach of this term as to notice, there was no loss of chance to claim. She had not gained the chance by actually serving the minimum statutory period of twelve months to qualify and the action for breach of a contractual term could not be used to defeat Parliament's intention in specifying a minimum period of actual service.

==Negligence==
While the award of damages in tort may protect pre-existing expectations (e.g. of earning capacity or of business profits), a claimant cannot be seen to benefit from the breach of the duty of care. The measure of damages is therefore to ensure that the claimant is "no worse off" having suffered the breach of the duty of care. In each case, the claimant must prove the cause of action on the balance of probabilities. For these purposes, the court is required to speculate on what would have happened had there been no negligence. In many cases, loss and damage might have been sustained even if all had gone as planned. But there might always have been a chance that no long-term loss and damage would occur. For example, a person may attend a hospital with an existing injury. The only effect of any negligence in the treatment may be that the patient loses the chance of a full recovery, i.e. what was merely threatened becomes inevitable. Thus, actions by claimants whose chances of recovery from illness or injury have been reduced due to the [[professional negligence]] of their doctors have failed when they could not establish that, with proper treatment, their chances of recovery would have exceeded 50%. In ''[[Gregg v Scott]]'' [2005] UKHL 2; [2005] 2 WLR 268 a man whose chances of surviving non-Hodgkins Lymphoma for ten years were reduced from 42% to 25% by a delay in diagnosis could not claim damages because his chances were already too slim for the delay to have worsened his position.  This was complicated by the fact that the case was brought before the court following an extended delay at which point the plaintiff was still alive. In judgement this was cited as a significant weakness in his claim. The principle is that a claimant must have had a more than 50% chance of survival to establish causation in order to satisfy the balance of probability test. However, in some Australian states, claims for loss of chance have been succeeded in medical negligence cases.&lt;ref name="Rufo v Hosking"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|391|2004|litigants=Rufo v Hosking |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach argues that a patient would rather have a 42% than a 25% chance of survival. If negligence reduces the percentage, common sense justice rejects a black-and-white approach to accepting or rejecting a claim based on an expert's opinion as to whether there was ever a 50% chance of survival, and prefers to offer mitigated damages to represent the loss of chance.
 
In cases of economic loss, the rule that a claimant cannot normally recover for a lost chance is modified. In ''[[Kitchen v. Royal Airforce Association]]'' [1958] 2 All ER 241 a solicitor failed to issue a writ within the period of limitation in respect of a fatal accident. The surviving spouse sued for damages as she was unable to pursue her claim. There was no doubt that the loss was caused by the solicitors’ negligence and the only argument related to quantification of her claim. Although it was argued on behalf of the solicitors that the claimant might not have won her case, and may therefore have lost nothing, the court held that she had lost a chance and, as this was a valuable right, she should be compensated for it. Similarly, in ''[[Stovold v. Barlows]]'' (1996) PNLR 91 a solicitor acting for a vendor failed to use the appropriate system for sending the title deeds to a purchaser. Consequently, the claimant lost his chance to sell the property at a higher price. But damages were reduced by 50% as the court held that the purchaser might have bought another property even if the documents had arrived on time. In ''First Interstate Bank of California v Cohen Arnold &amp; Co.'' (1996) PNLR 17 the claimant bank had loaned money to a client of the defendant accountants who negligently overstated the net worth of their clients. The bank then became concerned about the amount of the loan outstanding but, relying on the representations made by the defendant accountants, the bank delayed in calling in the loan. As a result of the delay in placing the property on the market, the price obtained was £1.45 million whereas the bank contended that it could have realised £3 million in an earlier sale. The Court of Appeal valued the chance at 66.66% on the assumption that “but for” the negligence, the property would actually have been sold for 66.66% of £3 million.

In commercial cases, damages are assessed not on the outcome which the claimant would have sought, but on the economic opportunity which he has lost. The claimant must prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she would have taken action to obtain the relevant benefit or avoid the relevant risk. Once this has been established, the claimant need only show that the chance which he or she has lost was real or substantial. In ''[[Coudert Brothers]] v. Normans Bay Ltd. (formerly Illingworth, Morris Ltd.)'' [2004] EWCA Civ 215 the court reviewed two earlier authorities:''Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons'' and ''Equitable Life Assurance Society v Ernst &amp; Young'' (2003) EWCA Civ 1114. The claimant, Normans Bay Ltd. was advised by Coudert Brothers in a tender for 49% of the shares in a Russian company, [[Bolshevichka]], in 1993, but the investment was lost. NBL claimed that, "but for" Coudert's negligence, the tender would have survived. At first instance, Buckley J assessed that chance of survival at 70%. The prior cases establish that loss of chance claims require proof on the balance of probabilities that:
#the claimant would have sought to secure the advantage which is the subject matter of the claim for valuation.
#where the claim depends on the hypothetical acts of a third party, e.g. whether the panel of a beauty contest would have awarded a prize to the claimant, the claimant has lost a real or substantial chance as opposed to a speculative or fanciful chance.
If both of these are proved, the court must assess that chance lost. If the chance was low, the court will award a low percentage of the value of the chance in damages; if the chance had a high probability of success, a high percentage will be awarded. On appeal the award was reduced to 40%. The court also dismissed Coudert's argument that its own negligence had broken the chain of causation because, to allow such an argument, would be to allow a party to benefit from their own unlawful act.

[[File:Manjuvajramandala con 43 divinità - Unknown - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Thangka]] painting of Manjuvajra mandala]]

A '''mandala''' (emphasis on first syllable; [[Sanskrit]] मण्डल, maṇḍala – literally "circle") is a spiritual and ritual [[symbol]] in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], representing the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web | title = mandala | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandala | year = 2008 | publisher = Merriam–Webster Online Dictionary | accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In common use, "mandala" has become a generic term for any diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the [[cosmos]] metaphysically or symbolically; a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the [[universe]].

The basic form of most mandalas is a square with four gates containing a circle with a [[Bindu (symbol)|center point]]. Each gate is in the general shape of a T.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/mandala.html Kheper,''The Buddhist Mandala – Sacred Geometry and Art'']&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalas often have radial [[Formal balance|balance]].&lt;ref name=SaylorIntroPDF&gt;{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 4: The Artistic Principles|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-4.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in the [[Rigveda]] as the name of the sections of the work, and [[Vedic rituals]] use mandalas such as the [[Navagraha]] mandala to this day. Mandalas are also used in Buddhism.

In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction.

==Hinduism==
[[File:Vishnu Mandala.jpg|thumb|Mandala of [[Vishnu]]]]

===Religious meaning===
A ''[[yantra]]'' is similar to a mandala, usually smaller and using a more limited colour palette. It may be a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in ''[[sadhana]]s'', puja or meditative rituals, and may incorporate a [[mantra]] into its design. It is considered to represent the abode of the deity. Each ''yantra'' is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs. According to one scholar, "Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience"&lt;ref&gt;[[Madhu Khanna|Khanna Madhu]], ''Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity''. Thames and Hudson, 1979, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many situate ''yantras'' as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice. ''Yantras'' are not representations, but are lived, experiential, [[Nondualism|nondual]] realities. As Khanna describes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite its cosmic meanings a ''yantra'' is a reality lived. Because of the relationship that exists in the [[Tantra]]s between the outer world (the macrocosm) and man's inner world (the microcosm), every symbol in a ''yantra'' is ambivalently resonant in inner–outer synthesis, and is associated with the subtle body and aspects of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Madhu, ''Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity''. Thames and Hudson, 1979, pp. 12-22&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Political meaning===
{{main|Mandala (political model)}}
The ''[[Rajamandala]]'' (or ''Raja-mandala''; circle of states) was formulated by the [[India]]n author [[Kautilya]] in his work on politics, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE). It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king's state.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Prof. Mahendra Prasad (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=80q_hd7ASdEC Indian Political Thought: Themes and Thinkers]''. Pearson Education India. {{ISBN|8131758516}}. pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In historical, social and political sense, the term "mandala" is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states). It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term 'state' in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Vajrayana===
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, mandalas have been developed also into [[sandpainting]]. They are also a key part of [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] meditation practices.

====Visualisation of Vajrayana teachings====
The mandala can be shown to represent in visual form the core essence of the [[Vajrayana]] teachings. The mind is "a microcosm representing various divine powers at work in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SghdYBbMds0C&amp;pg=PA343 |title=Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs: The New Age Movement |author=John Ankerberg, John Weldon |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandala represents the nature of the Pure Land, Enlightened mind.

An example of this type of mandala is [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37614 ''Vajrabhairava mandala''] a silk tapestry woven with gilded paper depicting lavish elements like crowns and jewelry, which gives a three-dimensional effect to the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vajrabhairava Mandala|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37614|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=James C.Y.|title=When Silk was Gold: Central Asian and Chinese Textiles|date=1997|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|page=95|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/When_Silk_Was_Gold_Central_Asian_and_Chinese_Textiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mandala can also represent the entire universe, which is traditionally depicted with [[Mount Meru]] as the [[axis mundi]] in the center, surrounded by the continents.&lt;ref&gt;Mipham (2000) pp. 65,80&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39738 ''Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru''], a [[silk]] [[tapestry]] from the [[Yuan dynasty]] that serves as a diagram of the Tibetan cosmology, which was given to China from Nepal and Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39738|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=James C.Y.|title=The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|page=247|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_World_of_Khubilai_Khan_Chinese_Art_in_the_Yuan_Dynasty#|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wisdom and impermanence=====
In the mandala, the outer circle of fire usually symbolises wisdom. The ring of eight [[charnel ground]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdcu.org.au/scw/thanka.html |title=A Monograph on a Vajrayogini Thanka Painting |date=13 August 2003 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030813002533/http://www.bdcu.org.au/scw/thanka.html |archivedate=13 August 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents the [[Buddhist]] exhortation to be always mindful of death, and the impermanence with which ''[[samsara]]'' is suffused: "such locations were utilized in order to confront and to realize the transient nature of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described elsewhere: "within a flaming rainbow nimbus and encircled by a black ring of [[dorje]]s, the major outer ring depicts the eight great charnel grounds, to emphasize the dangerous nature of human life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sootze.com/tibet/mandala.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303134523/http://www.sootze.com/tibet/mandala.htm |archivedate=2006-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside these rings lie the walls of the mandala palace itself, specifically a place populated by deities and [[Buddha (general)|Buddhas]].

=====Five Buddhas=====
One well-known type of mandala is the mandala of the "Five Buddhas", archetypal Buddha forms embodying various aspects of enlightenment. Such Buddhas are depicted depending on the school of [[Buddhism]], and even the specific purpose of the mandala. A common mandala of this type is that of the [[Five Wisdom Buddhas]] (a.k.a. Five ''[[Jinas]]''), the Buddhas [[Vairocana]], [[Aksobhya]], [[Ratnasambhava]], [[Amitabha]] and [[Amoghasiddhi]]. When paired with another mandala depicting the [[Five Wisdom Kings]], this forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].

====Practice====
[[File:Painted 19th century Tibetan mandala of the Naropa tradition, Vajrayogini stands in the center of two crossed red triangles, Rubin Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Tantric mandala of [[Vajrayogini]]]]
Mandalas are commonly used by tantric Buddhists as an aid to meditation.

The mandala is "a support for the meditating person",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; something to be repeatedly contemplated to the point of saturation, such that the image of the mandala becomes fully internalised in even the minutest detail and can then be summoned and contemplated at will as a clear and vivid visualized image. With every mandala comes what Tucci calls "its associated liturgy ... contained in texts known as [[tantras]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/mandalas/tibet.html|title=The Mandala in Tibet|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructing practitioners on how the mandala should be drawn, built and visualised, and indicating the [[mantra]]s to be recited during its ritual use.

By visualizing "pure lands", one learns to understand experience ''itself'' as pure, and as the abode of enlightenment. The protection that we need, in this view, is from our own minds, as much as from external sources of confusion. In many tantric mandalas, this aspect of separation and protection from the outer samsaric world is depicted by "the four outer circles: the purifying fire of wisdom, the [[vajra]] circle, the circle with the eight tombs, the lotus circle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyh.dk/indengl.htm|title=Mandala|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring of ''vajras'' forms a connected fence-like arrangement running around the perimeter of the outer mandala circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyh.dk/indengl.htm#Circles|title=Mandala|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a meditation on impermanence (a central teaching of [[Buddhism]]), after days or weeks of creating the intricate pattern of a [[sand mandala]], the sand is brushed together into a pile and spilled into a body of running water to spread the blessings of the mandala.

[[Per Kvaerne|Kværne]]&lt;ref&gt;Per Kvaerne 1975: p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt; in his extended discussion of [[sahaja]], discusses the relationship of [[sadhana]] interiority and exteriority in relation to mandala thus:
{{quote|...external ritual and internal sadhana form an indistinguishable whole, and this unity finds its most pregnant expression in the form of the mandala, the sacred enclosure consisting of concentric squares and circles drawn on the ground and representing that adamant plane of being on which the aspirant to Buddha hood wishes to establish himself. The unfolding of the tantric ritual depends on the mandala; and where a material mandala is not employed, the adept proceeds to construct one mentally in the course of his meditation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kvaerne|first= Per |year=1975|title= On the Concept of Sahaja in Indian Buddhist Tantric Literature.

====Offerings====
[[File:Chenrezig Sand Mandala.jpg|thumb|[[Chenrezig]] [[sand mandala]] created at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the occasion of the [[Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama's]] visit in May 2008]]

A "mandala offering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/tantra/buddhist-tantra/what-is-a-mandala|title=What Is a Mandala?|website=studybuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is a symbolic offering of the entire universe. Every intricate detail of these mandalas is fixed in the tradition and has specific symbolic meanings, often on more than one level.

Whereas the above mandala represents the pure surroundings of a Buddha, this mandala represents the universe. This type of mandala is used for the mandala-offerings, during which one symbolically offers the universe to the Buddhas or to one's teacher. Within Vajrayana practice, 1,000,000 of these mandala offerings (to create merit) can be part of the preliminary practices before a student even begins actual tantric practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thubtenchodron.org/PrayersAndPractices/preliminary_practice.htm|title=Preliminary practice (ngöndro) overview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandala is generally structured according to the model of the universe as taught in a Buddhist classic text the ''[[Abhidharmakosha|Abhidharma-kośa]]'', with [[Mount Meru]] at the centre, surrounded by the continents, oceans and mountains, etc.

===Shingon Buddhism===
One Japanese branch of Mahayana Buddhism—[[Shingon]] Buddhism—makes frequent use of mandalas in its rituals as well, though the actual mandalas differ. When Shingon's founder, [[Kukai]], returned from his training in China, he brought back two mandalas that became central to Shingon ritual: the [[Womb Realm|Mandala of the Womb Realm]] and the [[Diamond Realm|Mandala of the Diamond Realm]].

These two mandalas are engaged in the ''[[abhiseka]]'' initiation rituals for new Shingon students, more commonly known as the ''Kechien Kanjō'' (結縁灌頂). A common feature of this ritual is to blindfold the new initiate and to have them throw a flower upon either mandala. Where the flower lands assists in the determination of which [[yidam|tutelary deity]] the initiate should follow.

[[Sand mandala]]s, as found in Tibetan Buddhism, are not practiced in Shingon Buddhism.

=== Nichiren Buddhism ===
The mandala in [[Nichiren Buddhism]] is called a ''moji-mandala'' (文字曼陀羅) and is a paper [[hanging scroll]] or wooden tablet whose inscription consists of [[kanji|Chinese characters]] and [[Siddhaṃ script|medieval-Sanskrit script]] representing elements of the Buddha's [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], protective Buddhist deities, and certain Buddhist concepts. Called the ''[[Gohonzon]]'', it was originally inscribed by [[Nichiren]], the founder of this branch of [[Japanese Buddhism]], during the late 13th Century. The ''Gohonzon'' is the primary object of veneration in some Nichiren schools and the only one in others, which consider it to be the supreme object of worship as the embodiment of the supreme [[Dharma]] and Nichiren's inner enlightenment. The seven characters [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]], considered to be the name of the supreme Dharma, as well as the [[invocation]] that believers chant, are written down the center of all Nichiren-sect ''Gohonzons'', whose appearance may otherwise vary depending on the particular school and other factors.

===Pure Land Buddhism===
Mandalas have sometimes been used in [[Pure Land Buddhism]] to graphically represent [[Pure Land]]s, based on descriptions found in the ''[[Larger Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Contemplation Sutra]]''. The most famous mandala in Japan is the [[Taima mandala]], dated to about 763 CE. The Taima mandala is based on the ''Contemplation Sutra'', but other similar mandalas have been made subsequently. Unlike mandalas used in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, it is not used as an object of meditation or for esoteric ritual. Instead, it provides a visual representation of the Pure Land texts, and is used as a teaching aid.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Also in [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhism, [[Shinran]] and his descendant, [[Rennyo]], sought a way to create easily accessible objects of reverence for the lower-classes of Japanese society. Shinran designed a mandala using a hanging scroll, and the words of the ''[[nembutsu]]'' (南無阿彌陀佛) written vertically. This style of mandala is still used by some [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhists in home altars, or ''[[butsudan]]''.

==Mesoamerican civilizations==
===Mayan ''Tzolk'in''===
[[File:Mayan_Compass_2.jpg|thumb|right|Mayan ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' wheel from 498 AD.]]
One of several parallels between Eastern and [[Mesoamerican]] cultures, the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilization tended to present calendars in a mandala form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontiers-of-anthropology.blogspot.com/2012/01/mayan-mandala.html Frontiers of Anthropology — The Mayan Mandala]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in form and function to the ''[[Kalachakra]]'' (Wheel of Time) sand paintings of Tibetan Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-resonance.org/maya.html Mandalas of the Maya: Celestial Waters and the Auroral Plumes of Tláloc]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tzolk'in'' wheel has 260 segments, surprising because the Mayans recognized that the calendar year is 365 days long. The inclusion of the specific number 260 could however relate to the 26,000 year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. If so, this would indicate a remarkable awareness of these great cycles of time by this culture. Ultimately, the symbol was probably used for ritual purposes, and to measure the interval of a number of 9-month intervals like pregnancy, the cultivation time of some crops, and rituals that were performed at a 260-day spacing each year, for example, spring and fall.

This Mayan symbology has even made its way into [[New Age]] symbolism as the [[Dreamspell]] calendar, developed by [[José Argüelles]]. Sometimes described as an authentic Mayan mandala, it is "inspired by" elements of the ''Tzolk'in'' wheel of time.

===Aztec Sun Stone===
[[File:Aztec_calendar_on_Amate.jpg|thumb|right|The Aztec Sun Stone as an [[amate]] print.]]
The [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]] of the Aztec civilization was once believed to be their equivalent of a Tzolk'in calendar, but is now thought to be a ceremonial representation of the entire universe as seen by the Aztec religious class.

The earliest interpretations of the stone relate to its use as a calendar. In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican anthropologist [[Antonio de León y Gama]] wrote a treatise on the Aztec calendar using the stone as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio de León y Gama: ''Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos piedras'' [http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbc0001/2006/2006kislak2/2006kislak2.pdf León y Gama]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the circles of [[glyph]]s are the glyphs for the days of the month.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23"&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Casey|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=1979|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the stone is its religious significance. One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents [[Tonatiuh]], the Aztec deity of the sun. It is for this reason that the stone became known as the "Sun Stone." Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents [[Tlaltecuhtli]], the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23" /&gt; Modern archaeologists, such as those at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Anthropology Museum]] in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifices]] than as an astrological or astronomical reference.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"&gt;[https://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/obsidian_mirror/aztec_calendar_stone.html Getty Museum, "Aztec Calendar Stone"] ''getty.edu'', accessed 22 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance. The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points. The inner circles may express space as well as time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, there is the political aspect of the stone. It may have been intended to show [[Tenochtitlan]] as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend argues for this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns—1 Flint (''Tecpatl''), 1 Rain (''Atl''), and 7 Monkey (''Ozomahtli'')—represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state. He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within ''Tenochtitlan''. His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler [[Moctezuma II]]'s name on the work. These elements ground the Stone's iconography in history rather than myth and the legitimacy of the state in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912811300|title=State and cosmos in the art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Richard Fraser|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University|year=|isbn=9780884020837|location=|pages=|oclc=912811300|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[File:Marsh-chapel-window.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rose window|round window]] at the site of the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]] supervised by [[Walter Pahnke]]]]
Forms which are evocative of mandalas are prevalent in Christianity: the [[celtic cross]]; the [[rosary]]; the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; the [[aureole]]; [[oculus|oculi]]; the [[Crown of Thorns]]; [[rose window]]s; the [[Rosy Cross]]; and the [[dromenon]] on the floor of [[Chartres Cathedral]]. The dromenon represents a journey from the outer world to the inner sacred centre where the Divine is found.&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 11, 54, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cosmati]] [[Pavement (architecture)|pavement]]s, including that at [[Westminster Abbey]], are geometric mandala-like [[mosaic]] designs from thirteenth century Italy. The Great Pavement at Westminster Abbey is believed to embody divine and cosmic geometries as the seat of enthronement of the monarchs of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/conservation/video-library|title=Cosmati Pavement - Video Library|website=www.westminster-abbey.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, many of the Illuminations of [[Hildegard von Bingen]] can be used as mandalas, as well as many of the images of [[esoteric Christianity]], as in [[Christian]] [[Hermeticism]], [[Christian]] [[Alchemy]], and [[Rosicrucianism]].

Alchemist, Mathematician and Astrologer [[John Dee]] developed a geometric symbol which he called the ''[[Sigillum Dei]]'' 'Seal of God' manifesting a universal geometric order which incorporated the names of the [[archangels]], derived from earlier forms of the ''clavicula salomonis'' or [[key of Solomon]].
[[File:Sloane3188-john dee.png|thumb|right|The Seal of God; a mystic [[pentagram]] symbol composed by Dee]]
[[The Layer Monument]], an early 17th-century marble mural funerary monument at the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]], is a rare example of Christian iconography absorbing alchemical symbolism to create a mandala in Western funerary art.

== Mandalas in Persian art ==
In Persian Islamic theosophy, each of us is a part of God. We have been separated from our source like the rays of the sun and, we need to always keep in our mind that we have a divine light in us, which is the source of love. This light always shows us the right path to grow and find our way back to our source.

Therefore in Persian Shamseh motif which symbolizes the sun, there is a center which is the symbol of god or the source of energy. This small circle is surrounded by many other circles or polygons with the same center but in different sizes. These circles are the light rays of the sun which symbolize every god’s creature. Every creature tends to reach God, so the purpose of life is to reach back the source of energy which is mentioned as pure love in some references. Some of us are closer to our origin, while some of us have a long journey to reach it. As in Shamseh, some circles are smaller, therefore, closer to the center.

Shamseh motif was wildly applied during Safavid time in Iran. Safavid was one of the most important ruling dynasties of Iran in art, architecture, astrology, philosophy, and theosophy. An extraordinary example of Shamseh motif would be the tiling of the ceiling of Sheik Lotfollah mosque in Isfahan. Persian "Shamseh" motif painted on a copper plate. The art of hand painting and enameling is called "Meenakari" in Farsi.]]

==Western psychological interpretations==
According to art therapist and mental health counselor Susanne F. Fincher, we owe the re-introduction of mandalas into modern Western thought to [[Carl Jung]], the Swiss analytical psychologist. In his pioneering exploration of the unconscious through his own art making, Jung observed the motif of the circle spontaneously appearing. The circle drawings reflected his inner state at that moment. Familiarity with the philosophical writings of India prompted Jung to adopt the word "mandala" to describe these circle drawings he and his patients made. In his autobiography, Jung wrote:
{{quote|I sketched every morning in a notebook a small circular drawing, ... which seemed to correspond to my inner situation at the time. ... Only gradually did I discover what the mandala really is: ... the Self, the wholeness of the personality, which if all goes well is harmonious.|Carl Jung|''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'', pp. 195–196.}}

Jung recognized that the urge to make mandalas emerges during moments of intense personal growth. Their appearance indicates a profound re-balancing process is underway in the psyche. The result of the process is a more complex and better integrated personality.
{{quote|The mandala serves a conservative purpose—namely, to restore a previously existing order. But it also serves the creative purpose of giving expression and form to something that does not yet exist, something new and unique. ... The process is that of the ascending spiral, which grows upward while simultaneously returning again and again to the same point.|Jungian analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]]|C. G. Jung: ''[[Man and His Symbols]]'', p. 225}}

Creating mandalas helps stabilize, integrate, and re-order inner life.&lt;ref&gt;see Susanne F. Fincher: ''Creating Mandalas: For Insight, Healing, and Self-Expression'', pp. 1 - 18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the psychologist [[David Fontana]], its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: ''Meditating with Mandalas'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==In archaeology==
One of the most intense archaeological discoveries in recent years that could redefine the history of eastern thought and tradition of mandala is the discovery of five giant mandalas in the valley of [[Manipur]] made with Google Earth imagery. Located in the paddy field in the west of [[Imphal]], the capital of Manipur, the Maklang geoglyph is perhaps the world’s largest mandala built entirely of mud. The site wasn’t discovered until 2013 as its whole structure could only be visible via Google Earth satellite imagery. The whole paddy field, locally known as [[Bihu Loukon]], is now protected and announced as historical monument and site by the government of Manipur in the same year.  The site is situated 12&amp;nbsp;km aerial distance from [[Kangla]] with the GPS coordinates of 24° 48' N and 93° 49' E. It covers a total area of around 224,161.45 square meters. This square mandala has four similar protruding rectangular ‘gates’  in the cardinal directions guarded each by similar but smaller rectangular ‘gates’ on the left and right. Within the square there is an eight petalled flower or rayed-star, recently called as Maklang ‘Star fort’ by the locals, in the centre covering a total area of around 50,836.66 square meters. The discovery of other five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur is also made with Google Earth.  The five giant mandalas, viz., Sekmai mandala, Heikakmapal mandala, Phurju twin mandalas and Sangolmang mandala are located on the western bank of the Iril River.&lt;ref&gt;Wangam, Somorjit (2018).

==In architecture==
[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|right|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a Mandala]]
[[Buddhist architecture]] often applied mandala as the blueprint or plan to design Buddhist structures, including [[Buddhist temple|temple complex]] and stupas. A notable example of mandala in architecture is the 9th century [[Borobudur]] in Central Java, Indonesia. It is built as a large [[stupa]] surrounded by smaller ones arranged on terraces formed as a [[stepped pyramid]], and when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant [[Vajrayana|tantric Buddhist]] mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.&lt;ref name="Wayman"&gt;{{cite conference|author=A. Wayman| title=Reflections on the Theory of Barabudur as a Mandala| booktitle=Barabudur History and Significance of a Buddhist Monument| publisher=Asian Humanities Press| location=Berkeley| year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other temples from the same period also has mandala plan, including [[Sewu]], [[Plaosan]] and [[Prambanan]]. The similar mandala plan design are also observable in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.

==In science==
[[File:Hexapoda phylogenetic tree.png|thumb|Phylogenetic tree of [[Hexapoda]] (insects and their six-legged relatives).

Circular diagrams are often used in [[phylogenetics]], especially for the graphical representation of phylogenetic relationships. [[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary trees]] often encompass numerous species that are conveniently shown on a circular tree, with images of the species shown on the periphery of a tree. Such diagrams have been called phylogenetic mandalas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In contemporary use==
Mandalas can be found in early [[Buddhist]] art from the [[14th century|14th]] and [[15th century|15th centuries]].

Fashion designer [[Mandali Mendrilla]] designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the [[China Art Museum]] in Shanghai in November 2015. The pattern of the dress was based on the Goloka Yantra mandala, shaped as a lotus with eight petals. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living [[Wish Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formsofdevotion.org/china-art-museum-in-shanghai/|title=China Art Museum in Shanghai - Forms of Devotion|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wall.hr/fashion/izlozena-haljina-mandali-mendrile-hit-je-izlozbe-u-najvecem-kineskom-muzeju/|title=Haljinu "Mandala of Desires" dnevno posjećuje čak 30 000 ljudi!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the '''metaphysics of presence''' is an important consideration in [[deconstruction]]. Deconstructive [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]] holds that the entire [[history of philosophy|history]] of [[Western philosophy]] with its language and traditions has emphasized the desire for immediate access to [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], and thus built a [[metaphysics]] or [[ontotheology]] based on privileging presence over [[Nonexistence|absence]].

==Overview==
In ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927; transl. 1962), [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the concept of time prevalent in all Western thought has largely remained unchanged since the definition offered by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''. Heidegger says, "[[Aristotle]]'s essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this phenomenon [time] which has come down to us. Every subsequent account of time, including [[Henri Bergson]]'s, has been [[essentialism|essentially]] determined by it."&lt;ref name=:0&gt;''Being and Time'' (1962), §6, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle defined time as "the number of movement in respect of before and after".&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'', Book IV, part 11&lt;/ref&gt; By defining time in this way Aristotle privileges what is [[Heideggerian terminology|present-at-hand]], namely the "presence" of time. Heidegger argues in response that "entities are grasped in their Being as 'presence'; this means that they are understood with regard to a definite mode of time – the 'Present'".&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; Central to Heidegger's own philosophical project is the attempt to gain a more authentic understanding of time. Heidegger considers time to be the unity of three [[Ecstasy (philosophy)#Existential philosophy|ecstases]]: the past, the present, and the future. 

Deconstructive thinkers, like [[Jacques Derrida]], describe their task as the questioning or ''deconstruction'' of this metaphysical tendency in Western philosophy. Derrida writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of [[Ousia#Philosophy|ousia]] as [[parousia]], on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite."&lt;ref&gt;"Ousia and Grammē: Note on a Note from 'Being and Time,'" in ''Margins of Philosophy'' (1972), 29–67: 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who in ''Being and Time'' claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as the [[ready-to-hand]] and [[being-with]].

The presence to which Heidegger refers is both a presence as in a "now" and also a presence as in an eternal present, as one might associate with God or the "eternal" [[Physical law|laws of science]]. This [[hypostatized]] (underlying) belief in presence is undermined by novel [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] ideas, such that presence itself does not subsist, but comes about primordially through the action of our futural projection, our realization of [[finitude]] and the reception or rejection of the traditions of our time.

{{distinguish|negative liberties|positive liberties}}
'''Negative and positive rights''' are [[rights]] that oblige either action (''positive rights'') or inaction (''negative rights''). These obligations may be of either a [[natural and legal rights|legal or moral]] character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to [[liberty rights]].

To take an example involving [[Party (law)|two parties in a court of law]]: Adrian has a ''negative right to x'' against Clay [[if and only if]] Clay is ''prohibited'' from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. In contrast, Adrian has a ''positive right to x'' against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. A case in point, if Adrian has a ''negative right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a ''positive right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.

Rights considered ''negative rights'' may include [[civil and political rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]], life, [[property (ownership right)|private property]], freedom from [[violent crime]], [[freedom of religion]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', a [[fair trial]], and freedom from [[slavery]].

Rights considered ''positive rights'', as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist [[Karel Vasak]], may include other civil and political rights such as [[police]] protection of person and property and the [[right to counsel]], as well as [[economic, social and cultural rights]] such as [[right to food|food]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[public education]], [[employment]], [[national security]], [[military]], [[right to health|health care]], [[social security]], [[right to internet access|internet access]], and a minimum [[right to an adequate standard of living|standard of living]]. In the [[three generations of human rights|"three generations"]] account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations.

Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid.

==Overview==
Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right ''not to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or [[coercion]].  As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to ''negate'' them. A positive right is a right ''to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group.  In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be ''added'' to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]], negative rights can be associated with [[Categorical imperative#Perfect duty|perfect duties]] while positive rights can be connected to [[Categorical imperative#Imperfect duty|imperfect duties]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and [[unemployment benefit]]s.

==When they conflict==

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

Rights are often spoken of as [[natural rights|inalienable]] and sometimes even [[moral absolutism|absolute]]. However, in practice this is often taken as [[graded absolutism]]; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: [[right of self-defense|self-defense]]. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered [[prima facie]], meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.

Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a [[police officer]] may have a negative obligation not to tackle people&amp;mdash;but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill&amp;mdash;being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation&amp;mdash;is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.

Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered ''[[prima facie]]''. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception&amp;mdash;one higher obligation of self-defense&amp;mdash;but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of [[triage]] after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably ''prima facie''. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably ''prima facie'' they must always be agreed to through contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html "Individual rights"], ''Ayn Rand Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:
{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary." It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Jan Narveson]], the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is "mistaken". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Narveson - Libertarianism: A Philosophical Introduction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210122955/http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|url=http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|author=Narveson, Jan|work=Against Politics|archivedate=February 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarians]] hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life&amp;mdash;but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are [[natural monopolies]] or [[public goods]]&amp;mdash;features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. [[Robert Nozick]] discusses this idea at length in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.{{ref|nozick}}

===In medicine===
In the field of [[medicine]], positive rights of [[patient]]s often conflict with negative rights of [[physician]]s.  In controversial areas such as [[abortion]] and [[assisted suicide]], medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by [[conscience clause]] statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/do-we-need-a-pro-choice-l_b_178456.html|title=Do We Need a Pro-Choice Litmus Test for Obstetricians?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case of [[Janet Murdock]], a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/big-sky-dilemma-must-doct_b_275034.html|title=Big Sky Dilemma: Must Doctors Help Their Patients Die?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] and bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]].&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley J.|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2009/09/03/right-to-die-means-a-physician-duty-to-kill/|title=The 'Right to Die' Means a Physician Duty to Kill?|date=3 September 2009|website=First Things|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'', Appel has written:
{{quote|Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians&amp;mdash;with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing to impose duties on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;}}

Smith replies that this is "taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill", which he argues "reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government’s role".&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Aid Pakistan Truck.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be fully guaranteed by only positive, or else only negative duties; it needs both.]]
Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher [[Henry Shue]] is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more "negative" or "positive") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a "negative" duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe ''any right'' as though it requires only one of the two types of duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights/&gt;

To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting "standard threats" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. "if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights&gt;Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of ''[[Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes:
{{quote|What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in ''taking from the surplus possessions of the rich'' what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference.(emphasis added){{ref|sterba}}}}
Sterba has rephrased the traditional "positive right" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of "negative right" ''not to be prevented'' from taking the resources on their own.. Thus, all rights may not only require both "positive" and "negative" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will.{{ref|sterba}} The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from "[[right to education]]" or "[[right to health|right to health care]]" to "right to take surplus money to pay teachers" or "right to take surplus money to pay doctors".

The '''northern ribbon snake''' (''Thamnophis sauritus septentrionalis'') is a [[subspecies]] of [[garter snake]]. It is one of four [[subspecies]] of the ribbon snake (''[[Thamnophis sauritus]]'') and occurs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in southern [[Maine]], [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], southern [[Ontario]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Nova Scotia]], northern [[Ohio|Minnesota, Ohio]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]]. It is listed as a state [[endangered species]] in [[Wisconsin]]. It is a slender [[black]] or [[brown]] snake with three bright-[[yellow]] or [[white]] stripes on its back and sides.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; The head is black, with the [[scale (zoology)|scales]] alongside the mouth being white. The underside is also white or light yellow, but it is mostly white on juveniles and adults. Adult ribbon snakes are {{convert|45|-|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/subsite/glfc-amphibians/thamnophis-sauritus Northern Ribbon Snake], Natural Resources Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribbon snakes inhabit marshes or live near the edges of lakes, ponds, and streams. They swim well and their diets include [[frog]]s, [[tadpole]]s, [[salamander]]s, small [[fish]], and [[insect]]s.

Northern ribbon snakes have from three to 26 young which are born in late summer. The young snakes are 7-9&amp;nbsp;in long and are colored the same as the adults. As most garter snakes, the mother gives birth to live young ([[ovoviviparous]]).

A '''paradox''' is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. K. and Lewis, M. W. (2011). Toward a theory of paradox: A dynamic equilibrium model of organizing. ''Academy of Management Review,'' 36, pp. 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y., Waldman, D. A., Han, Y., and Li, X. (2015). Paradoxical leader behaviors in people management: Antecedents and consequences. ''Academy of Management Journal,'' 58, pp. 538-566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Waldman and    David E. Bowen (2016), Learning to Be a Paradox-Savvy Leader, ''Academy of Management -- Perspectives,'' vol. 30, no. 3, 316-327, {{doi|10.5465/amp.2015.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical paradoxes are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments but are still valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], are not yet resolved.

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical paradox==
{{See also|List of paradoxes}}
Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion between different levels of [[abstraction]].

[[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]] outlines three laws of the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference: An example is "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. One more example would be "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction: "This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true.  This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish because his wish contradicts itself.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions.  This form is common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

For example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road.  The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]].  Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy.  He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true.  The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality.  Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s.  "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.  In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | publication-place = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless.  Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a [[leap day]].  Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting- results to the will of the people.  The [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make.  In 20th-Century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration.  The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements.  [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.  For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.
A fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s.  It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others.  Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |pmc=3298219 |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''periodic matrix set''' is a set of [[Square matrix#Square matrices|square matrices]] in which each square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is of a different size, and such that each cell within each matrix within a set contains data associated with some type of periodic distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Periodic table#Periodicity of chemical properties]]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Construction of a set==
A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] may be specified to contain a fixed number of matrices and is identified by a set number (''S''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''S'' is the set identification number and ''M'' is the number of matrices included in the set. There is no limit to the number of matrices which may be members of a periodic set.

Each matrix within a set has an identification number (a) and must contain a "root cell". A root cell must be located at any corner of a matrix. All root cells must be located at the same corner of each matrix within a single set. A diagonal line drawn from a root cell to the opposite corner of the same matrix is a "root diagonal".

The periodicity is defined by "partial square rings" (rings) of cells adjoining a root cell on two sides. All cells within the same ring, (even if they are located in a different matrix) have a similar "period". If a matrix contains (n+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cells then the outermost ring contains "2n+1" cells which are all included in the same period. A ring identification number (n) identifies each period. The root cell is also the smallest ring and is identified as; n = 0. Each subsequent ring (1, 2, 3, etc.) has 2n+1 cells (3, 5, 7, etc.).

Individual cells contained within a ring are identified by their [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from the root diagonal. Each cell within a ring is assigned a deviation number (D). All cells intersected by the root diagonal have; D = 0. All cell locations in a column deviation have positive values of D. All cell locations in a row deviation have negative values of D.

Any cell within a set will require three numbers for the identification of its location;&lt;br /&gt;a is the matrix number&lt;br /&gt;n is the ring number&lt;br /&gt;D is the deviation number

The cell could also have its location identified as;&lt;br /&gt;a is the matrix number&lt;br /&gt;x is the column number (root cell = 0)&lt;br /&gt;y is the row number (root cell = 0)

The two locational systems are analogous to Radial (anD) and Cartesian (axy) systems. Generally this article will use the "anD" locational method.

The contents of any cell must contain data that is periodic in some manner.

==Combined Sets==
Combinations of sets are possible; however each set must be [[conformable]] for combination. A resultant set (R&lt;sub&gt;N M&lt;/sub&gt;) is the combination of N sets each having M matrices.

Two sets (of compatible construction) may combine so that the root cells on similar sized matrices are adjacent. This is a "set pair" and is identified by a "pair number" (P). The resultant matrices are not square but are 2n x n rectangular.

Four sets may also combine so that all root cells on similar sized matrices are adjacent. This gives a resultant set of square matrices having an even number of cells on each side. All root cells will form a central 2x2 "core" within each resultant matrix. The resultant set is actually two pairs. Each pair forms half of the resultant set. The identifiers (P,S) will tag each quadrant of the resultant set, which is all of the original sets. &lt;br /&gt;P = +½ represents the upper pair&lt;br /&gt;P = -½ represents the lower pair&lt;br /&gt;S = +½ represents the right set of each pair.&lt;br /&gt;S = -½ represents the left set of each pair.

Five identifiers are required to locate any cell in R&lt;sub&gt;4 M&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;P is the pair number&lt;br /&gt;S is the set number&lt;br /&gt;a is the matrix number&lt;br /&gt;n is the ring number&lt;br /&gt;D is the deviation number

==Applied sets==
Periodic matrix sets have an application to chemistry (for example, in the [[periodic table]]) and particle physics (for example, with [[sub atomic particle]]s). The resultant set R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; is of special interest.

The periodic rings may be associated with quantum harmonic oscillation. A [[Quantum_harmonic_oscillator#Hamiltonian_and_energy_eigenstates|quantum harmonic oscillator]] has energy (E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) defined as; E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (n + ½)ћω. Where; ћ = h/2π and h is Planck's constant, and ω is frequency. The number of cells in each period may be written as; 2E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/ћω.

The rings may also be associated with [[atomic orbitals]]. If the ring number (n) is equal to the [[quantum number]] for orbital angular momentum (the azimuthal number '''''l''''' ), then the rings (0, 1, 2, 3) correspond to the orbitals (s, p, d, f). The ring number is NOT equal to the principal quantum number ('''''n''''' ). The number of cells per ring is half the number of electrons per orbital due to spin duality of the electrons.

The quantum numbers are; &lt;br /&gt;'''''n''''' is the principal quantum number&lt;br /&gt;'''''l''''' is the quantum number for orbital angular momentum (the azimuthal number)&lt;br /&gt;'''''ml''''' is the orbital magnetic moment&lt;br /&gt;'''''ms''''' is the spin magnetic moment

The spin quantum number ('''''s''''') is not normally used in chemistry applications as all electrons are; '''''s''''' = ½.
&lt;br /&gt;The atomic number ('''''Z''''') may be expressed as a function of energies which in turn are functions of the quantum numbers.

If a resultant set is R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; then the locational numbers correspond to the quantum numbers as follows.
&lt;br /&gt;S = '''''ms'''''
&lt;br /&gt;n = '''''l'''''
&lt;br /&gt;D = '''''ml'''''

The Madelung rule gives the "P" and "a" relationships. This rule may be generalized as follows; &lt;br /&gt;2a - P = '''''n''''' + '''''l''''' + '''''s'''''
&lt;br /&gt;(2'''''n''''' + 2'''''l''''' + 2'''''s''''' - 4a)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1

This generalization may also be obtained from '''''J''''' coupling.

If; P = -½
&lt;br /&gt;Then; a = ½('''''n''''' + '''''l''''')

If; P = +½
&lt;br /&gt;Then; a = ½('''''n''''' + '''''l''''') + ½

The sub-atomic particles may be grouped as an R&lt;sub&gt;4 3&lt;/sub&gt; combination.

==Data compliance==
A set is considered to be "locationally compliant" if the data contained in each cell is also a function of the location of the cell. Let an R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; resultant set be populated with atomic numbers. Each cell contains one atomic number ('''''Z'''''). The number in each cell should be a function of the locators of the cell. If a term is associated with each locator then the atomic number will be the sum of all terms and a constant.

'''''Z''''' = '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; - ½

The five locator terms are as follows.

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = -2a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(P+½)

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = -2(n+½)(S+½)

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4a(a+1)(a+½)/3

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = -2n(n+½)

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = (D+½)

This distribution of atomic numbers in R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; is a locationally compliant matrix set of the Periodic Table. The following tables show the resultant matrices populated with the atomic numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">A '''population model''' is a type of [[mathematical model]] that is applied to the study of [[population dynamics]]. 

==Rationale==

[[Mathematical model|Model]]s allow a better understanding of how complex interactions and processes work. Modeling of dynamic interactions in nature can provide a manageable way of understanding how numbers change over time or in relation to each other. Many patterns can be noticed by using population modeling as a tool.&lt;ref name="Worster"&gt;{{cite book|last = Worster|first = Donald|title = Nature's Economy|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1994|pages = 398–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecological]] population modeling is concerned with the changes in parameters such as [[population size]] and [[age distribution]] within a population. This might be due to interactions with the environment, individuals of their own species, or other species.&lt;ref name="Uyenoyama"&gt;{{cite book|last = Uyenoyama|first = Marcy|title = The Evolution of Population Biology |editor=Rama Singh |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2004|pages = 1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Population models are used to determine maximum harvest for agriculturists, to understand the dynamics of [[biological invasion]]s, and for [[environmental conservation]]. Population models are also used to understand the spread of parasites, viruses, and [[disease spread|disease]].&lt;ref name="Uyenoyama"/&gt;

Another way populations models are useful are when species become endangered. Population models can track the fragile species and work and curb the decline. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1447430?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]  

== History ==
Late 18th-century biologists began to develop techniques in population modeling in order to understand dynamics of growing and shrinking ball populations of living organisms. [[Thomas Malthus]] was one of the first to note that populations grew with a geometric pattern while contemplating the fate of humankind.&lt;ref name = "McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last = McIntosh|first = Robert|title = The Background of Ecology|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1985|pages = 171–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most basic and milestone models of population growth was the [[logistic model of population growth]] formulated by [[Pierre François Verhulst]] in 1838. The logistic model takes the shape of a [[sigmoid curve]] and describes the growth of a population as exponential, followed by a decrease in growth, and bound by a carrying capacity due to environmental pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Renshaw|first = Eric|title = Modeling Biological Populations in Space and Time|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|pages = 6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Population modeling became of particular interest to biologists in the 20th century as pressure on limited means of sustenance due to increasing human populations in parts of Europe were noticed by biologist like [[Raymond Pearl]]. In 1921 Pearl invited physicist [[Alfred J. Lotka]] to assist him in his lab. Lotka developed paired [[differential equation]]s that showed the effect of a parasite on its prey. Mathematician [[Vito Volterra]] equated the relationship between two species independent from Lotka. Together, Lotka and Volterra formed the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra model]] for competition that applies the logistic equation to two species illustrating competition, predation, and parasitism interactions between species.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"/&gt; In 1939 contributions to population modeling were given by Patrick Leslie as he began work in biomathematics. Leslie emphasized the importance of constructing a life table in order to understand the effect that key life history strategies played in the dynamics of whole populations. Matrix algebra was used by Leslie in conjunction with life tables to extend the work of Lotka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kingsland|first = Sharon|title = Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1995|pages = 127–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matrix population models|Matrix models]] of populations calculate the growth of a population with life history variables. Later, [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] characterized island biogeography. The [[Ecology#Biogeography|equilibrium model of island biogeography]] describes the number of species on an island as an equilibrium of immigration and extinction. The logistic population model, the Lotka–Volterra model of community ecology, life table matrix modeling, the equilibrium model of island biogeography and variations thereof are the basis for ecological population modeling today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gotelli|first = Nicholas|title = A Primer of Ecology|publisher = Sinauer|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equations ==

[[Logistic growth]] equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Lotka-Volterra equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1\frac{K_1-N_1 - \alpha N_2}{K_1}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Island biogeography]]:

: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{IP}{I+E}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Species–area relationship]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\log(S) = \log(c)+z \log(A)\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11648">'''Primary Deviance''' is the initial stage in defining [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. Prominent Sociologist [[Edwin Lemert]] &lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Edwin. 1967. ''Human Deviance, Social Problems and Social Control''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized primary deviance as engaging in the initial act of deviance. This is very common throughout society, as everyone takes part in [[Norm (social)|basic]] form violation.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, William. 2011. ''Crime in Canadian Context''. Ontario: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Primary deviance does not result in a person internalizing a deviant identity, so one does not alter their self-concept to include this deviant identity. It is not until the act becomes labeled or tagged, that secondary deviation may materialize. According to Edwin Lemert, Primary Deviance is the acts that are carried out by the individual that allows them to carry the deviant label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Sociology|last=Giddens, et al|first=Anthony|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92223-3|location=New York, New York|pages=168|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences on Primary Deviant Behavior ==

=== Family and home life ===
Parental support and the influence that Parents have on their children is one of the highest contributors to the behavior in adolescents. This is the primary stage in which behaviors, morals and values are learned and adopted. The guidance from parents is intended to mold and shape the behaviors that will qualify them to properly function in society. Praises, love, affection, encouragement and many other aspects of positive enforcement is one of the largest components of parental support. However, this is not all it takes to prevent deviant behaviors from forming and occurring.Parents must enforce "effective discipline, monitoring, and problem-solving techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Amber|title=How Parents Influence Deviant Behavior among Adolescents: An Analysis of Family Life, their Community, and their Peers|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Children who come from homes where parents do not enforce positive behaviors and do not punish deviant behaviors appropriately, are children who are likely to engage in deviant behaviors. This type of bond is considered weak and cause the child to act out become deviant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crosswhite|first1=Jennifer M.|last2=Kerpelman|first2=Jennifer L.|title=Coercion Theory, Self-Control, and Social Information Processing: Understanding Potential Mediators for How Parents Influence Deviant Behavior|date=2009|pages=611–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

=== Peers ===
Strong bonds with Parents is essential to the social group that the child will choose to associate with. When there is little to no control in the home, no positive enforcement from Parents, and the child does not have positive feelings towards schooling and education; they are more likely to associate with deviant peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Amber|title=How Parents Influence Deviant Behavior among Adolescents: An Analysis of Family Life, their Community, and their Peers|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; When associating with deviant peers, they are more accepting of deviant behaviors than if the child chose another social group. This is why it is vital the Parent-Child bond is strong because it will have an ultimate influence on the peers they choose and will have an influence on if they choose to engage in primary deviant behaviors as a juvenile.

== Sociological contributors ==

=== Frank Tannenbaum ===
[[File:Frank Tannenbaum 1915.jpg|thumb|'''&lt;u&gt;Frank Tannenbaum&lt;/u&gt;'''
]]
[[Frank Tannenbaum]], theorized that Primary Deviant behaviors may be innocent or fun for those committing the act, but can become a nuisance and viewed as some form of delinquency to their parents, educators and even those in law enforcement. Tannenbaum distinguished two different types of deviancy. The first one being the initial act which the child considers to be of innocence but are labeled as deviant by the adult, this label is called Primary Deviancy. The second is after they've been initially labeled that they graduate to [[Secondary deviance]] in which both the adult and child agree that they are a deviant. Tannenbaum stated that the "over dramatization" of these deviant acts can cause one to be labeled and accept the label of being a deviant. Due to them accepting this label, they will eventually graduate from being a primary deviant to a secondary deviant thus committing greater crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio, et al|first1=Alex|title=Deviant Behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-20516-5|page=37|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==

=== Labeling Theory ===
[[File:George Herbert Mead.jpg|thumb|249x249px|'''&lt;u&gt;George Herbert Mead&lt;/u&gt;''']]
The most prevalent theory as it relates to Primary Deviance was developed in the early 1960s by a group of sociologists and was titled [[Labeling theory]]. The Labeling theory is a variant of Symbolic interactionism. [[Symbolic interactionism]] is "a theoretical approach in sociology developed by the famous [[George Herbert Mead]]. It emphasizes the roles of symbols and language as core elements of human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Sociology|last=Giddens et al|first=Anthony|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92223-3|location=New York, New York|pages=A12|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labeling theory according to Labeling Theorists; is applied by those put in place to keep law and order, such as Police Officers, Judges; etc. Those are the people who typically label the people who have violated some law or another. The label 'Deviant' does not come from the person who has committed the act,but someone who is more powerful than the person being labeled. This theory has been tremendously criticized for not being able to explain what causes deviance early on. However, The Labeling Theory's main focus is to explain how Labeling relates and can cause [[Secondary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio, Taylor, Schwartz|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-20516-5|pages=38–39|edition=11th|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anomie Theory ===
[[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]] developed the ''Anomie Theory'' which was dedicated specifically to the causes of deviance. The word [[Anomie]] was derived from the 'Godfather of Sociology' [[Emile Durkheim]]. Anomie is "the breakdown of social norms that results from society's urging people to be ambitious but failing to provide them with legitimate opportunities to succeed" ''&lt;ref name="Thio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio, Taylor, Schwartz|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-20516-5|pages=17–18|edition=11th|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Merton theorized that society places substantial emphasis on the importance of achieving success. However, this goal is not attainable for people of all social classes.Due to the absence of resources for people of lower social classes to achieve a great level of success, Merton theorized that people are forced to commit deviant acts. Merton has labeled the deviants behavior's as ''Innovation''&lt;ref name="Thio" /&gt;

=== Social Learning Theory ===
The Social Learning theory theorizes that deviant behavior is learned through Social Interactions with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio|first1=Alex|last2=Taylor|first2=Jim|last3=Schwartz|first3=Martin|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=23–24|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Sutherland]] developed an explanation for this theory which explains how one learns deviant behavior. This explanation is called [[differential association]].

===Differential Association===
[[Differential Association]] theorizes that "If an individual associates with people who hold deviant ideas more than with people who embrace conventional ideas, the individual is likely to become deviant.&lt;ref name="Deviant Behavior"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio|first1=Alex|last2=Taylor|first2=Jim|last3=Schwartz|first3=Martin|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=24|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The person that is presenting the deviant act isn't always necessarily the deviant.  The emphasis of [[differential association]] is that if someone is presented with the opportunity they will likely commit the act.Although some one may associate with both deviants and those who hold conventional ideas, if the deviant contacts outweigh the conventional contacts then deviancy is likely to occur. [[Differential Association]]'s main key point refers particularly to the [[Association (psychology)|association]] aspect. [[Differential Association]] is theorized to be "the cause of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].&lt;ref name="Deviant Behavior"/&gt;

== Example of Primary Deviance ==

=== Charles Manson ===
[[File:CharlesManson2014.jpg|thumb|'''Charles Miles Manson''']]
A person who was labeled as deviant was the infamous murderer [[Charles Manson]]. Manson was born to a 16 year old [[Kathleen Maddox]] on November 12, 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Manson's Father, Colonel Scott left Manson's mother to raise him alone. When Charles was seven years old, he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in [[McMechen, West Virginia]] after his mother was sentenced to 5 years in prison for  armed robbery. Living with his aunt and uncle, Manson was given a more stable life that could allow him to be a positive contributor to society. However, the absence of his mother and the yearning he had for that motherly love and affection caused Manson to indulge in primary deviant behavior at a young age, which ultimately manifested into secondary deviance as he became older.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4qZB2ytq10|title=Charles Manson: Diane Sawyer Documentary|website=www.YouTube.com|last1=Manson|first1=Charles|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the counsel of another uncle, a "mountain man" who lived in the mountains of Kentucky, Manson labeled himself a rebel. Manson's first act of deviancy began at the age of 9 years old when he set his school on fire and was sent to reform school. Throughout his adolescent, Manson was sent to several reform schools in hopes of rehabilitating him. Between 1942 and 1947 after her release from prison, Manson's mother was unable to properly care for him and was unsuccessful in finding him a foster home. She turned him over to the courts and allowed them to place him in an all boys school called [[Gibault School for Boys]]. Ten months later, Manson ran away from the [[Gibault School for Boys]] in hopes of rekindling a relationship he had longed for with his mother. After she rejected him Manson turned to a life of deviancy. Manson thrived off of high-consensus deviant acts such as burglary and theft. Manson was then sent to [[Father Flanagan's Boys' Home]] in 1949. After 4 days at Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, Manson ran away and pursued other deviant acts; such as auto theft, burglary, and armed robbery. Manson ran away 18 times from the [[National Training School for Boys]] where he alleged he was molested and beaten. This behavior in Manson's early years, caused this label of deviant to shadow him through his adult life, where he eventually graduated to [[Secondary deviance]] and eventually led the dangerous cult The Manson Family.&lt;ref name="Sawyer" /&gt;

[[File:LM RCS.jpg|thumb|right|Two of four Reaction Control System thruster quads on the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]]]
A '''reaction control system''' ('''RCS''') is a spacecraft system that uses [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] to provide [[attitude control]],&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO "altitude control"!!! --&gt; and sometimes [[translation (geometry)|translation]]. Use of diverted engine thrust to provide stable attitude control of a [[V/STOL|short-or-vertical takeoff and landing aircraft]] below conventional winged flight speeds, such as with the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier#Controls and handling|Harrier "jump jet"]], may also be referred to as a reaction control system.

An RCS is capable of providing small amounts of [[thrust]] in any desired direction or combination of directions. An RCS is also capable of providing [[torque]] to allow control of [[rotation]] ([[aircraft principal axes|roll, pitch, and yaw]]).

Reaction control systems often use combinations of large and small ([[vernier thruster|vernier]]) thrusters, to allow different levels of response. Spacecraft reaction control systems are used for:

* [[attitude control]] during [[re-entry]];
* [[stationkeeping]] in [[orbit]];
* close [[Space rendezvous|maneuvering]] during [[Space rendezvous|docking]] procedures;
* control of [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], or 'pointing the nose' of the craft;
* a backup means of [[atmospheric reentry|deorbiting]];
* [[ullage motor]]s to prime the fuel system for a main engine burn.

Because spacecraft only contain a finite amount of fuel and there is little chance to refill them, alternative reaction control systems have been developed so that fuel can be conserved. For stationkeeping, some spacecraft (particularly those in [[geosynchronous orbit]]) use high-[[specific impulse]] engines such as [[arcjet]]s, [[ion thruster]]s, or [[Hall effect thruster]]s. To control orientation, a few spacecraft, including the [[International Space Station|ISS]], use [[momentum wheel]]s which spin to control rotational rates on the vehicle.

==Location of thrusters on spacecraft==
[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|left|Gemini OAMS and Re-entry Control System]]
The [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] [[space capsule]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] re-entry module both used groupings of nozzles to provide [[attitude control]]. The thrusters were located off their [[center of gravity]], thus providing a [[torque]] to rotate the capsule. The Gemini capsule was also capable of adjusting its re-entry course by rolling, which directed its off-center lifting force. The Mercury thrusters used a [[hydrogen peroxide]] monopropellant which turned to steam when forced through a [[tungsten]] screen, and the Gemini thrusters used [[hypergolic]] [[mono-methyl hydrazine]] fuel oxidized with [[nitrogen tetroxide]].

The Gemini spacecraft was also equipped with a hypergolic [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]], which made it the first manned spacecraft with [[translation (physics)|translation]] as well as rotation capability. In-orbit attitude control was achieved by firing pairs of eight {{convert|25|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters located around the circumference of its adapter module at the extreme aft end. Lateral translation control was provided by four {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters around the circumference at the forward end of the adaptor module (close to the spacecraft's center of mass). Two forward-pointing {{convert|85|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters at the same location, provided aft translation, and two {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters located in the aft end of the adapter module provided forward thrust, which could be used to change the craft's orbit.

The [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Apollo Command Module]] had a set of twelve hypergolic thrusters for attitude control, and directional re-entry control similar to Gemini.

The Apollo [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] each had a set of sixteen [[R-4D]] hypergolic thrusters, grouped into external clusters of four, to provide both translation and attitude control. The clusters were located near the craft's centers of gravity, and were fired in pairs in opposite directions for attitude control.

A pair of translation thrusters are located at the rear of the Soyuz spacecraft; the counter-acting thrusters are similarly paired in the middle of the spacecraft (near the center of mass) pointing outwards and forward. These act in pairs to prevent the spacecraft from rotating. The thrusters for the lateral directions are mounted close to the center of mass of the spacecraft, in pairs as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Location of thrusters on spaceplanes===
[[File:Shuttle front RCS.jpg|thumb|250px|RCS thrusters on the nose of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]].]]

The suborbital [[X-15]] and a companion training aero-spacecraft, the [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104 AST]], both intended to travel to an altitude that rendered their aerodynamic control surfaces unusable, established a convention for locations for thrusters on winged vehicles not intended to dock in space; that is, those that only have attitude control thrusters. Those for pitch and yaw are located in the nose, forward of the cockpit, and replace a standard radar system. Those for roll are located at the wingtips. The [[X-20]], which would have gone into orbit, continued this pattern.

Unlike these, the [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]] had many more thrusters, as it was required to carry out docking maneuvers in orbit. Shuttle thrusters were grouped in the nose of the vehicle and on each of the two aft [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] pods. No nozzles interrupted the heat shield on the underside of the craft; instead, the nose RCS nozzles which control positive pitch were mounted on the side of the vehicle, and were canted downward. The downward-facing negative pitch thrusters were located in the [[Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS]] pods mounted in the tail/afterbody.

==Space station systems==
The [[International Space Station]] uses electrically powered reaction control [[Control_moment_gyroscope|gyroscopes]] for primary attitude control, with RCS thruster systems as backup and augmentation systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=34777.0;attach=586775&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colorful Clown 3.jpg|thumb|This ridiculously small hat is incongruous with the man's head size.|200px]]

To be '''ridiculous''' is to be something which is highly incongruous or inferior, sometimes deliberately so to make people laugh or get their attention, and sometimes unintendedly so as to be considered laughable and earn or provoke ridicule and derision. It comes from the 1540s Latin "ridiculosus" meaning  "laughable", from "ridiculus" meaning  "that which excites laughter", and from "ridere" meaning "to laugh".&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridiculous Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "Ridiculous" is an adjective describing "the ridiculous".

In common usage, "ridiculousness" is used as a synonym for [[absurdity]] or [[nonsense]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonsensical Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/illogicality Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; From a historical and technical viewpoint, "absurdity" is associated with argumentation and reasoning, "nonsense" with [[semantics]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], while "ridiculous" is most associated with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. ''[[Reductio ad absurdum]]'' is a valid method of [[argument]], while ''[[appeal to ridicule|reductio ad ridiculum]]'' is invalid. Argument by [[invective]] declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a [[logical reasoning|cogent]] semantic problem with lack or meaning or [[ambiguity]].

Historically, the ridiculous was central to initial theories of humor and laughter as first put forth by philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]. It is currently used in the [[theories of humor|theory of humor]] to create laughter, shock, parody, or satire. Reactions to the ridiculous have been studied in [[psychology]] for its effects on memory, attention, and attitude in social hierarchies. These studies have been applied to the theory of advertisement regarding attention, memory, and alleviation of preexisting negative attitudes toward products. The ridiculous is often contrasted with the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], one of extreme inferiority, the other of extreme superiority, and often one can suddenly move from one extreme state to the other.

== Humor ==
{{Further information|Theory of humor}}

=== History: Incongruity, the superiority theory of humor, and deformity ===
The ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., "when something that was dignified is reduced to a
ridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughter
is most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'."&lt;ref&gt;''Humour, Jokes and the Statement'', Journal of Human Values, 2006, S Acharya, [http://jhv.sagepub.com/content/12/2/179.short]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284 British Journal of Aesthetics, (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p.284]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Aristotle]], we laugh at inferior or [[unattractiveness|ugly]] individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', 1449a, p. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] was reported by [[Plato]] as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self-ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Philebus'' 49b ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deformity]] was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Laughter as a Test of Truth in Enlightenment Satire'', Werner von Koppenfels&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HEL&gt;A history of English Laughter: Laughter from Beowulf to Beckett and Beyond, Manfred Pfister&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories of humor  include the "incongruity theory" and the "superiority theory", the latter of which the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent.&lt;ref&gt;The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke? Sexist Humor and What's Wrong With It, Memo Bergmann, Hypatia, Vol.1, Issue 1, March 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humor as a Double‐Edged Sword: Four Functions of Humor in Communication, JC Meyer, Communication Theory, Volume 10, Issue 3, pages 310–331, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes claimed that laughter was either caused spontaneously, or by seeing a deformed thing to which one compares themselves and laugh as a form of self applause; "a sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison of the infirmities of others." &lt;ref name=HEL/&gt; The Right Reverend [[William Warburton]], [[Lord Bishop]] of [[Gloucester]] said in the early 18th century that, "Nothing is ridiculous but what is deformed".&lt;ref&gt;The divine legation of Moses demonstrated, William Warburton&lt;/ref&gt; Using the ridiculous is a method in the theory of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Investigating the humor of gelotophobes: Does feeling ridiculous equal being humorless?, Humor - International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 22, Issue 1-2, Pages 111–143, ISSN (Online) 1613-3722, ISSN (Print) 0933-1719, {{doi|10.1515/HUMR.2009.006}}, /February/2009, Willibald Ruch, Ursula Beermann, [http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/HUMR.2009.006?journalCode=humr]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although common usage now considers "absurdity" to be synonymous with "ridiculousness", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning, as in [[Hobbes' Table of Absurdity]], while ridiculousness has to do with laughter, superiority, ridicule, and deformity.

=== Native American Ritual Clown ===
{{Further information|Ritual clown}}
The [[Ritual clown]] ([[Heyókȟa]]) in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture uses the painfully ridiculous, and is believed to become closer to the gods by its [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;''Native American Postcolonial Psychology'', E Duran, B Duran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambigere: The Euro-American Picaro and the Native American Trickster, Melus, The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States Vol. 17, No. 1, Spring 1991, F Ballinger&lt;/ref&gt; Native American clowns are ridiculous in their contrary and rule breaking antics.&lt;ref&gt;The Mythology of Evil Among North American Indian Yuroks and Its Implications for Western Spirituality, Anthropology of Consciousness, Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 15–29, September 1996, Royal Alsup, Stanley Krippne, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/467321]&lt;/ref&gt; In the film ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'', the sacred clown rides sitting backwards on his horse, "washes" himself with dirt and "dries" himself with water.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer L. McMahon, B. Steve Csaki, ''The Philosophy of the Western'' (2010), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Heyókȟa are thought of as being incongruously backwards-forwards, upside-down, or contrary in nature. This spirit is often manifest by doing things backwards or unconventionally—riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking backwards. For example, if food were scarce, a Heyókȟa would sit around and complain about how full he was; during a baking hot heat wave a Heyókȟa would shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket. Similarly, when it is 40 degrees below freezing he will wander around naked for hours complaining that it is too hot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Parody and satire in social commentary ====
{{Further information|Parody|Satire}}
The ridiculous can use uses both physical and conceptual inferiority and incongruity of juxtaposition to create [[parody]] and [[satire]].

In ''[[Candide]]'',  [[Voltaire]] parodies [[Leibniz]]'s argument for the [[existence of evil]] under a benign God using ''"ridiculous rationalizations of evil"''.&lt;ref name="TCD"&gt;''"ridiculous rationalizations of evil"''. Teaching Candide-A Debate, The French Review, Vol 61, No. 5, 1988, Theodore E. D. Braun, Felicia Sturzer, Martine Darmon Meyer, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/393842]&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz claimed that God is constrained by logic, and created the best of all ''[[possible worlds]]''. After being reduced from a "[[dignity|dignified]]" state to its opposite, the [[optimistic]] Dr. [[Panglossian|Pangloss]] (representing Leibniz) finds cause to consider his undignified position to be the best of all possible worlds, noting his own particular current happiness, which he argues could not have been attained without experiencing the atrocities in the previous narrative; his optimistic attitude is extremely incongruous with his experiences and extremely inferior undignified ultimate condition.&lt;ref name= TCD/&gt;

In [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', apelike humans and their behavior are juxtaposed next to streamlined advanced technology with a highly avant garde score by composer [[György Ligeti]]; Ligeti also used ridiculous juxtaposition in his scores to create parody,&lt;ref&gt;Blending the Sublime and the Ridiculous: A Study of Parody in György Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre, Sewell, Amanda J, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021116/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?bgsu1150987452]&lt;/ref&gt; and this tool was frequently used by composer [[Peter Maxwell Davies]].

=== Deformity and incongruity in performance as social commentary, and lifestyle ===

==== Japanese Butoh dance ====
{{Further information|Butoh}}
Japanese [[Butoh]] uses both incongruity and deformity to create ridiculous dance performance and lifestyle; extreme movement methods that are highly incongruous with natural body movement in its dance and everyday lifestyle, as well as in its clothing, actions, costume and set design that is highly incongruous with societal norms, which often shock the audience or visitor, and are sometimes considered not only ridiculous, but incongruently "bizarre and [[beauty|beautiful]]" or "[[elegant]] and [[grotesque]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizarre World of Butoh'', San Fransciso Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizzare and the Beautiful'', Los Angeles Times, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Theatre of the Ridiculous ====
{{Further information|Theatre of the Ridiculous}}
The Theatre of the Ridiculous uses highly incongruous stage settings and incongruous costumes such as [[cross dressing]] to disturb or create shock in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest of the Ridiculous:Ronald Tavel, John Vaccaro and Charles Ludlam, WarholStars, [http://www.warholstars.org/ridiculous.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology: attention, memory, and attitudes ==
Psychologists have studied human response to the ridiculous and its effects on attention and memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Psychology of Advertising, Walter Dill Scott, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Art of Memory: Usefulness in Treatment, Bernard M. Patten, Archives of Neurology, 1972;26(1):25-31, [http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
The ridiculous is used in advertising to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] attention and attitudes toward products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Music for advertising effects, Psychology and Marketing, Volume 1, Issue 3-4, 1984, S Hecker&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juxtaposition with the sublime {{anchor| Ridiculous and the sublime}} ==
The ridiculous is sometimes contrasted to the sublime where something with one quality is thought of as approaching, or likely to change to, the other.

[[Thomas Paine]], writing in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' in 1795, said ''The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime, makes the ridiculous; and one step above the ridiculous, makes the sublime again.''&lt;ref name=odp&gt;{{cite book|chapter=sublime | title=The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs | editor=Jennifer Speake | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t90.e2157| accessdate=2011-02-13}}  ''Available online to subscribers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]], reflecting on the state of his existence following his retreat from Moscow in 1812, famously remarked to Polish ambassador [[Dominique-Georges-Frédéric Dufour de Pradt|D. G. De Pradt]]: ''Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas'' (''There is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous'').&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;&lt;ref name=odp /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations, Robert Andrews&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Journal of Aesthetics, Aesthetics (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p. 284-5, [http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduction to the ridiculous,  or "reductio ad ridiculum" ===
{{Further information|Appeal to ridicule|Red herring|straw man}}
Reduction to the ridiculous (Latin: "reductio ad ridiculum", also called "Appeal to ridicule", "appeal to mockery", or "the Horse Laugh") is a logical fallacy which presents the opponent's argument in a way that grossly misrepresents it and appears ridiculous next to it, often so misrepresentative as to create a [[straw man]] argument, rather than addressing the argument itself.&lt;ref name=WT&gt;''Wishful Thinking and Other Philosophical Reflections'', Nicholas Rescher, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in arguing against [[idealism]], with its sophisticated arguments that the world was not real but only existed in the [[mind]], philosopher [[Dr. Johnson]] famously kicked a stone.&lt;ref Name=WT/&gt;

Contrasting ridiculousness with absurdity in [[reasoning]], ''Reductio ad ridiculum'' is an invalid method of argument, while ''reductio ad absurdum'' is a valid method.

=== Invective ===
Arguments are often simply dismissed by calling them "ridiculous" as invective, without further argumentation.&lt;ref name=WT/&gt; Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often dismissed philosophical positions by calling them "ridiculous" without further argument given.&lt;ref name=WT/&gt;

[[File:Chapitel IX. of Die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper.png|thumb|Chapter IX of [[David Hilbert]]'s ''Die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper.'' The chapter title is Die Zahlringe des Körpers, literally "the number rings of the field". The word "ring" is the contraction of "Zahlring".]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''ring''' is one of the fundamental [[algebraic structure]]s used in [[abstract algebra]]. It consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] equipped with two [[binary operation]]s that generalize the [[arithmetic operation]]s of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. Through this generalization, theorems from [[arithmetic]] are extended to non-numerical objects such as [[polynomial]]s, [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[function (mathematics)|functions]].

A ring is an [[abelian group]] with a second [[binary operation]] that is [[Associative_property|associative]], is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over the abelian group operation, and has an [[identity element]] (this last property is not required by some authors, see {{slink||Notes on the definition}}). By extension from the [[integer]]s, the abelian group operation is called ''addition'' and the second binary operation is called ''multiplication''.

Whether a ring is commutative or not (i.e., whether the order in which two elements are multiplied changes the result or not) has profound implications on its behavior as an abstract object. As a result, commutative ring theory, commonly known as [[commutative algebra]], is a key topic in [[ring theory]]. Its development has been greatly influenced by problems and ideas occurring naturally in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. Examples of commutative rings include the set of integers equipped with the addition and multiplication operations, the set of polynomials equipped with their addition and multiplication, the [[coordinate ring]] of an [[affine algebraic variety]], and the [[ring of integers]] of a number field. Examples of noncommutative rings include the ring of ''n'' × ''n'' real [[square matrix|square matrices]] with ''n'' ≥ 2, [[group ring]]s in [[representation theory]], [[operator algebra]]s in [[functional analysis]], [[ring of differential operators|rings of differential operators]] in the theory of [[differential operator]]s, and the [[cohomology ring]] of a [[topological space]] in [[topology]].

The conceptualization of rings began in the 1870s and was completed in the 1920s. Key contributors include [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Abraham Fraenkel|Fraenkel]], and [[Emmy Noether|Noether]]. Rings were first formalized as a generalization of [[Dedekind domain]]s that occur in [[number theory]], and of [[polynomial ring]]s and rings of invariants that occur in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[invariant theory]]. Afterward, they also proved to be useful in other branches of mathematics such as [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis]].
{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}

== Definition and illustration ==

The most familiar example of a ring is the set of all [[integer]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of the [[number]]s

:.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;, −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

The familiar properties for addition and multiplication of integers serve as a model for the axioms for rings.

=== Definition ===
A '''ring''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s&lt;ref&gt;This means that each operation is defined and produces a unique result in ''R'' for each ordered pair of elements of ''R''.&lt;/ref&gt; + and '''·''' satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the '''ring axioms'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|section=§I.8|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algebra|author1=[[Saunders MacLane]]|author2=Garrett Birkhoff|publisher=AMS Chelsea|page=85|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Serge Lang]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=83|year=2002|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. ''R'' is an [[abelian group]] under addition, meaning that:
:* (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, + is [[associativity|associative]]).
:* ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, + is [[commutativity|commutative]]).
:* There is an element 0 in ''R'' such that ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, 0 is the [[additive identity]]).
:* For each ''a'' in ''R'' there exists −''a'' in ''R'' such that ''a'' + (−''a'') = 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, −''a'' is the [[additive inverse]] of ''a'').
2. ''R'' is a [[monoid]] under multiplication, meaning that:
:* (''a'' · ''b'') · ''c'' = ''a'' · (''b'' · ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, · is associative).
:* There is an element 1 in ''R'' such that ''a'' · 1 = ''a'' and 1 · ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, 1 is the [[multiplicative identity]]).&lt;ref&gt;The existence of 1 is not assumed by some authors; here, the term "[[Rng (algebra)|rng]]" is used if existence of a multiplicative identity is not assumed.&lt;!-- This is the most common convention, and is adopted throughout wikipedia, please do not change --&gt; See [[Ring (mathematics)#Notes on the definition|next subsection]]&lt;/ref&gt;
3. Multiplication is [[distributive law|distributive]] with respect to addition:
:* ''a'' ⋅ (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(left distributivity).
:* (''b'' + ''c'') · ''a'' = (''b'' · ''a'') + (''c'' · ''a'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(right distributivity).

=== Notes on the definition ===
As explained in {{section link||History}} below, many authors follow an alternative convention in which a ring is not defined to have a multiplicative identity. This article adopts the convention that, unless otherwise stated, a ring is assumed to have such an identity. &lt;!--- This is also the convention in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics]]. ---&gt; A structure satisfying all the axioms ''except'' the requirement that there exists a multiplicative identity element is called a '''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]''' (commonly pronounced "rung", and sometimes called a '''[[pseudo-ring]]'''). For example, the set of even integers with the usual + and ⋅ is a rng, but not a ring.

The operations + and ⋅ are called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'', respectively. The multiplication symbol ⋅ is often omitted, so the [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] of ring elements is interpreted as multiplication. For example, ''xy'' means {{nowrap|''x'' ⋅ ''y''}}.

Although ring addition is [[commutative law|commutative]], ring multiplication is not required to be commutative: ''ab'' need not necessarily equal ''ba''. Rings that also satisfy commutativity for multiplication (such as the ring of [[integer]]s) are called '''[[commutative ring]]s'''. Books on commutative algebra or algebraic geometry often adopt the convention that "ring" means "commutative ring", to simplify terminology.

In a ring, multiplication does not have to have an inverse. A (non-[[zero ring|trivial]]) commutative ring such that every nonzero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]] is called a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

The additive group of a ring is the ring equipped just with the structure of addition. Although the definition assumes that the additive group is abelian, this can be inferred from the other ring axioms.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Isaacs, Algebra: A Graduate Course, AMS, 1994, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic properties ===
Some basic properties of a ring follow immediately from the axioms:
* The additive identity, the additive inverse of each element, and the multiplicative identity are unique.
* For any element ''x'' in a ring ''R'', one has ''x''0 = 0 = 0''x'' (zero is an [[absorbing element]] with respect to multiplication) and (–1)''x'' = –''x''.
* If 0 = 1 in a ring ''R'' (or more generally, 0 is a unit element), then ''R'' has only one element, and is called the [[zero ring]].
* The [[binomial formula]] holds for any commuting pair of elements (i.e., any ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''xy'' = ''yx'').

=== Example: Integers modulo 4 ===
{{see also| Modular arithmetic}}

Equip the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_4 = \{\overline{0},\overline{1},\overline{2},\overline{3}\}&lt;/math&gt; with the following operations:

* The sum &lt;math&gt;\overline{x} + \overline{y}&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the remainder when the integer ''x'' + ''y'' is divided by 4 (as ''x'' + ''y'' is always smaller than 8, this remainder is either ''x'' + ''y'' or ''x'' + ''y'' – 4). For example, &lt;math&gt;\overline{2} + \overline{3} = \overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{3} + \overline{3} = \overline{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The product &lt;math&gt;\overline{x} \cdot \overline{y}&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the remainder when the integer ''xy'' is divided by 4. For example, &lt;math&gt;\overline{2} \cdot \overline{3} = \overline{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{3} \cdot \overline{3} = \overline{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a ring: each axiom follows from the corresponding axiom for '''Z'''. If ''x'' is an integer, the remainder of ''x'' when divided by 4 may be considered as an element of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and this element is often denoted by {{nowrap|"''x'' mod 4"}} or &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which is consistent with the notation for 0,1,2,3. The additive inverse of any &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\overline{-x}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;-\overline{3}= \overline{-3} = \overline{1}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: 2-by-2 matrices ===
{{main|Matrix ring}}
The set of 2-by-2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with [[real number]] entries is written

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_2(\mathbb{R}) = \left\{ \left.\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \right|\  a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R} \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

With the operations of matrix addition and [[matrix multiplication]], this set satisfies the above ring axioms. The element &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the multiplicative identity of the ring. If &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;AB=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;BA=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;; this example shows that the ring is noncommutative.

More generally, for any ring ''R'', commutative or not, and any nonnegative integer ''n'', one may form the ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with entries in ''R'': see [[Matrix ring]].

== History ==

{{See also|Ring theory#History}}
[[File:Dedekind.jpeg|thumb|100px|right|[[Richard Dedekind]], one of the founders of [[ring theory]].]]

=== Dedekind ===
The study of rings originated from the theory of [[polynomial ring]]s and the theory of [[algebraic integer]]s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html The development of Ring Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, [[Richard Dedekind]] defined the concept of the ring of integers of a number field.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, he introduced the terms "ideal" (inspired by [[Ernst Kummer]]'s notion of ideal number) and "module" and studied their properties. But Dedekind did not use the term "ring" and did not define the concept of a ring in a general setting.

=== Hilbert ===
The term "Zahlring" (number ring) was coined by [[David Hilbert]] in 1892 and published in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th century German, the word "Ring" could mean "association", which is still used today in English in a limited sense (e.g., spy ring),&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/117292/why-is-a-ring-called-a-ring Why is a ring called a "ring"? - MathOverflow]&lt;/ref&gt; so if that were the etymology then it would be similar to the way "group" entered mathematics by being a non-technical word for "collection of related things". According to Harvey Cohn, Hilbert used the term for a ring that had the property of "circling directly back" to an element of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cohn|first=Harvey|title=Advanced Number Theory|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|year=1980|page=49|isbn=978-0-486-64023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in a ring of algebraic integers, all high powers of an algebraic integer can be written as an integral combination of a fixed set of lower powers, and thus the powers "cycle back". For instance, if {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''a'' + 1 = 0}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''a'' − 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = −''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 16''a'' − 4}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 16''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 8''a'' + 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = −8''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 65''a'' − 16}}, and so on; in general, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is going to be an integral linear combination of 1, ''a'', and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Fraenkel and Noether ===
The first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by [[Abraham Fraenkel|Adolf Fraenkel]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 86, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but his axioms were stricter than those in the modern definition. For instance, he required every [[zero divisor|non-zero-divisor]] to have a [[multiplicative inverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, p.&amp;nbsp;144, axiom&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;8)&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Emmy Noether]] gave the modern axiomatic definition of [[commutative ring|(commutative) ring]] and developed the foundations of commutative ring theory in her paper ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen''.&lt;ref name="Noether, p. 29"&gt;Noether, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplicative identity: mandatory vs. optional ===
Fraenkel required a ring to have a multiplicative identity 1,&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, p.&amp;nbsp;144, axiom&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;7)&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Noether did not.&lt;ref name="Noether, p. 29"/&gt;

Most or all books on algebra&lt;ref&gt;Van der Waerden, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zariski and Samuel, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; up to around 1960 followed Noether's convention of not requiring a 1. Starting in the 1960s, it became increasingly common to see books including the existence of 1 in the definition of ring, especially in advanced books by notable authors such as Artin,&lt;ref&gt;Artin, p.&amp;nbsp;346.&lt;/ref&gt; Atiyah and MacDonald,&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah and MacDonald, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourbaki,&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbud,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbud, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; But even today, there remain many books that do not require a 1.

Faced with this terminological ambiguity, some authors have tried to impose their views, while others have tried to adopt more precise terms.

In the first category, we find for instance Gardner and Wiegandt, who argue that if one requires all rings to have a 1, then some consequences include the lack of existence of infinite direct sums of rings, and the fact that proper direct summands of rings are not subrings. They conclude that "in many, maybe most, branches of ring theory the requirement of the existence of a unity element is not sensible, and therefore unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner and Wiegandt 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second category, we find authors who use the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;Wilder 1965, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotman 1998, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* rings with multiplicative identity: ''unital ring'', ''unitary ring'', ''unit ring'', ''ring with unity'', ''ring with identity'', or ''ring with 1''
:* rings not requiring multiplicative identity: ''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]'' or ''[[pseudo-ring]]'', although the latter may be confusing, as having other meanings.

== Basic examples ==

'''Commutative rings''':
* The prototype example is the ring of [[integer]]s with the two operations of addition and multiplication.
* The rational, real and complex numbers are commutative rings of a type called [[field (mathematics)|fields]].
* An [[algebra over a ring]] is itself a ring. These are also [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. Some examples:
** Any [[algebra over a field]].
** The [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''X''] of polynomials over a ring ''R'' is itself a ring. A [[free module]] over ''R'' of infinite dimension.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[c]&lt;/math&gt;, the integers with an irrational number ''c'' adjoined. A free module of infinite dimension if ''c'' is a [[transcendental number]], a free module of finite dimension if ''c'' is an [[algebraic integer]].
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[1/n]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] whose denominators are a power of ''n'' (including negative ones). A non-free module.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[1/10]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of [[decimal fraction]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[(1+\sqrt d)/2]&lt;/math&gt;, where ''d'' is a [[square-free]] integer of the form 4''n''+1. A free module of rank two. Cf. [[Quadratic integer]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Gaussian integer]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[(1+\sqrt{-3})/2]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Eisenstein integer]]s. Also their generalization, a [[Kummer ring]].
* The set of all [[algebraic integer]]s forms a ring. This follows for example from the fact that it is the [[integral closure]] of the ring of rational integers in the field of complex numbers. The rings in the three previous examples are subrings of this ring.
* The set of [[formal power series]] ''R''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; over a commutative ring ''R'' is a ring.
* If ''S'' is a set, then the [[power set]] of ''S'' becomes a ring if we define addition to be the [[symmetric difference]] of sets and multiplication to be [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. This corresponds to a [[ring of sets]] and is an example of a [[Boolean ring]].
* The set of all [[continuous function|continuous]] real-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on the real line forms a commutative ring. The operations are [[pointwise]] addition and multiplication of functions.
* Let ''X'' be a set and ''R'' a ring. Then the set of all functions from ''X'' to ''R'' forms a ring, which is commutative if ''R'' is commutative. The ring of continuous functions in the previous example is a subring of this ring if ''X'' is the real line and ''R'' is the field of real numbers.

'''Noncommutative rings''':
* For any ring ''R'' and any natural number ''n'', the set of all square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from ''R'', forms a ring with matrix addition and matrix multiplication as operations. For ''n'' = 1, this matrix ring is isomorphic to ''R'' itself. For ''n'' &gt; 1 (and ''R'' not the zero ring), this matrix ring is noncommutative.
* If ''G'' is an [[abelian group]], then the [[group homomorphism|endomorphisms]] of ''G'' form a ring, the [[endomorphism ring]] End(''G'') of ''G''. The operations in this ring are addition and composition of endomorphisms. More generally, if ''V'' is a [[left module]] over a ring ''R'', then the set of all ''R''-linear maps forms a ring, also called the endomorphism ring and denoted by End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'').
* If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''R'' is a ring, the [[group ring]] of ''G'' over ''R'' is a [[free module]] over ''R'' having ''G'' as basis. Multiplication is defined by the rules that the elements of ''G'' commute with the elements of ''R'' and multiply together as they do in the group ''G''.
* Many rings that appear in analysis are noncommutative. For example, most [[Banach algebra]]s are noncommutative.

'''Non-rings:'''
* The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the usual operations is not a ring, since ('''N''', +) is not even a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (the elements are not all [[invertible]] with respect to [[addition]]). For instance, there is no [[natural number]] which can be added to 3 to get 0 as a result. There is a natural way to make it a ring by adding negative numbers to the set, thus obtaining the ring of [[integer]]s. The natural numbers (including 0) form an algebraic structure known as a [[semiring]] (which has all of the properties of a ring except the additive inverse property).
* Let ''R'' be the set of all continuous functions on the real line that vanish outside a bounded interval depending on the function, with addition as usual but with multiplication defined as [[convolution]]:
*: &lt;math&gt;(f * g)(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(y)g(x-y)dy.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''R'' is a [[rng (algebra)|rng]], but not a ring: the [[Dirac delta function]] has the property of a multiplicative identity, but it is not a function and hence is not an element of ''R''.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Elements in a ring ===
A left [[zero divisor]] of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ring such that there exists a nonzero element &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This is the definition of Bourbaki. Some other authors such as Lang require a zero divisor to be nonzero.&lt;/ref&gt; A right zero divisor is defined similarly.

A [[nilpotent element]] is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a^n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. One example of a nilpotent element is a [[nilpotent matrix]]. A nilpotent element in a [[zero ring|nonzero ring]] is necessarily a zero divisor.

An [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an element such that &lt;math&gt;e^2 = e&lt;/math&gt;. One example of an idempotent element is a [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] in linear algebra.

A [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; having a [[multiplicative inverse]]; in this case the inverse is unique, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of units of a ring is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under ring multiplication; this group is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R^\times&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;U(R)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if ''R'' is the ring of all square matrices of size ''n'' over a field, then &lt;math&gt;R^\times&lt;/math&gt; consists of the set of all invertible matrices of size ''n'', and is called the [[general linear group]].

=== Subring ===
{{main|Subring}}
A subset ''S'' of ''R'' is said to be a [[subring]] if it can be regarded as a ring with the addition and the multiplication [[restricted function|restricted]] from ''R'' to ''S''. Equivalently, ''S'' is a subring if it is not empty, and for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'', &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; are in ''S''. If all rings have been assumed, by convention, to have a multiplicative identity, then to be a subring one would also require ''S'' to share the same identity element as ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;In the unital case, like addition and multiplication, the multiplicative identity must be restricted from the original ring. The definition is also equivalent to requiring the set-theoretic inclusion is a ring homomorphism.&lt;/ref&gt; So if all rings have been assumed to have a multiplicative identity, then a proper ideal is not a subring.

For example, the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is a subring of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s and also a subring of the ring of [[polynomial]]s '''Z'''[''X''] (in both cases, '''Z''' contains 1, which is the multiplicative identity of the larger rings). On the other hand, the subset of even integers 2'''Z''' does not contain the identity element 1 and thus does not qualify as a subring of '''Z'''.

An intersection of subrings is a subring. The smallest subring containing a given subset ''E'' of ''R'' is called a subring generated by ''E''. Such a subring exists since it is the intersection of all subrings containing ''E''.

For a ring ''R'', the smallest subring containing 1 is called the ''characteristic subring'' of ''R''. It can be obtained by adding copies of 1 and −1 together many times in any mixture. It is possible that &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1=1+1+\ldots+1&lt;/math&gt; (''n'' times) can be zero. If ''n'' is the smallest positive integer such that this occurs, then ''n'' is called the ''[[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]'' of ''R''. In some rings, &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1&lt;/math&gt; is never zero for any positive integer ''n'', and those rings are said to have ''characteristic zero''.&lt;!-- By using a homomorphism from the integers into ''R'' that sends 1 to 1, it can be shown by an isomorphism theorem that the characteristic subring is always a quotient ring of the integers. The problem: we haven't introduced homomorphisms and quotient rings yet. --&gt;

Given a ring ''R'', let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Z}(R)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all elements ''x'' in ''R'' such that ''x'' commutes with every element in ''R'': &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt; for any ''y'' in ''R''. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Z}(R)&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of ''R''; called the [[center (algebra)|center]] of ''R''. More generally, given a subset ''X'' of ''R'', let ''S'' be the set of all elements in ''R'' that commute with every element in ''X''. Then ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', called the [[centralizer (ring theory)|centralizer]] (or commutant) of ''X''. The center is the centralizer of the entire ring ''R''. Elements or subsets of the center are said to be ''central'' in ''R''; they generate a subring of the center.

=== Ideal ===
{{main|Ideal (ring theory)}}
The definition of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a ring is analogous to that of [[normal subgroup]] in a group. But, in actuality, it plays a role of an idealized generalization of an element in a ring; hence, the name "ideal". Like elements of rings, the study of ideals is central to structural understanding of a ring.

Let ''R'' be a ring. A nonempty subset ''I'' of ''R'' is then said to be a '''left ideal''' in ''R'' if, for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' and ''r'' in ''R'', &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;rx&lt;/math&gt; are in ''I''. If &lt;math&gt;R I&lt;/math&gt; denotes the span of ''I'' over ''R''; i.e., the set of finite sums
:&lt;math&gt;r_1 x_1 + \cdots + r_n x_n, \quad r_i \in R, \quad x_i \in I,&lt;/math&gt;
then ''I'' is a left ideal if &lt;math&gt;R I \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, ''I'' is said to be '''right ideal''' if &lt;math&gt;I R \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;. A subset ''I'' is said to be a '''two-sided ideal''' or simply '''ideal''' if it is both a left ideal and right ideal. A one-sided or two-sided ideal is then an additive subgroup of ''R''. If ''E'' is a subset of ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;R E&lt;/math&gt; is a left ideal, called the left ideal generated by ''E''; it is the smallest left ideal containing ''E''. Similarly, one can consider the right ideal or the two-sided ideal generated by a subset of ''R''.

If ''x'' is in ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;Rx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;xR&lt;/math&gt; are left ideals and right ideals, respectively; they are called the [[principal ideal|principal]] left ideals and right ideals generated by ''x''. The principal ideal &lt;math&gt;RxR&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the set of all positive and negative multiples of 2 along with 0 form an ideal of the integers, and this ideal is generated by the integer 2. In fact, every ideal of the ring of integers is principal.

Like a group, a ring is said to be [[simple ring|simple]] if it is nonzero and it has no proper nonzero two-sided ideals. A commutative simple ring is precisely a field.

Rings are often studied with special conditions set upon their ideals. For example, a ring in which there is no strictly increasing infinite [[total order#Chains|chain]] of left ideals is called a left [[Noetherian ring]]. A ring in which there is no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left [[Artinian ring]]. It is a somewhat surprising fact that a left Artinian ring is left Noetherian (the [[Hopkins–Levitzki theorem]]). The integers, however, form a Noetherian ring which is not Artinian.

For commutative rings, the ideals generalize the classical notion of divisibility and decomposition of an integer into prime numbers in algebra. A proper ideal ''P'' of ''R'' is called a [[prime ideal]] if for any elements &lt;math&gt;x, y\in R&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;xy \in P&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;x \in P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in P&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, ''P'' is prime if for any ideals &lt;math&gt;I, J&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;IJ \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;J \subseteq P.&lt;/math&gt; This latter formulation illustrates the idea of ideals as generalizations of elements.

=== Homomorphism ===
{{main|Ring homomorphism}}
A '''[[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]]''' from a ring (''R'', +, '''·''') to a ring (''S'', ‡, *) is a function ''f'' from ''R'' to ''S'' that preserves the ring operations; namely, such that, for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' the following identities hold:

* ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ‡ ''f''(''b'')
* ''f''(''a'' '''·''' ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') * ''f''(''b'')
* ''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;

If one is working with not necessarily unital rings, then the third condition is dropped.

A ring homomorphism is said to be an '''[[isomorphism]]''' if there exists an inverse homomorphism to ''f'' (i.e., a ring homomorphism which is an [[inverse function]]). Any [[bijection|bijective]] ring homomorphism is a ring isomorphism. Two rings &lt;math&gt;R, S&lt;/math&gt; are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them and in that case one writes &lt;math&gt;R \simeq S&lt;/math&gt;. A ring homomorphism between the same ring is called an endomorphism and an isomorphism between the same ring an automorphism.

Examples:
* The function that maps each integer ''x'' to its remainder modulo 4 (a number in {0, 1, 2, 3}) is a homomorphism from the ring '''Z''' to the quotient ring '''Z'''/4'''Z''' ("quotient ring" is defined below).
* If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a unit element in a ring ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;R \to R, x \mapsto uxu^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism, called an [[inner automorphism]] of ''R''.
* Let ''R'' be a commutative ring of prime characteristic ''p''. Then &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^p&lt;/math&gt; is a ring endomorphism of ''R'' called the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].
* The [[Galois group]] of a field extension &lt;math&gt;L/K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all automorphisms of ''L'' whose restrictions to ''K'' are the identity.
* For any ring ''R'', there are a unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' → ''R'' and a unique ring homomorphism ''R'' → 0.
* An [[epimorphism]] (i.e., right-cancelable morphism) of rings need not be surjective. For example, the unique map &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism.
* An algebra homomorphism from a ''k''-algebra to the [[endomorphism algebra]] of a vector space over ''k'' is called a [[algebra representation|representation of the algebra]].

Given a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f:R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all elements mapped to 0 by ''f'' is called the [[kernel of a ring homomorphism|kernel]] of ''f''. The kernel is a two-sided ideal of ''R''. The image of ''f'', on the other hand, is not always an ideal, but it is always a subring of ''S''.

To give a ring homomorphism from a commutative ring ''R'' to a ring ''A'' with image contained in the center of ''A'' is the same as to give a structure of an [[associative algebra|algebra]] over ''R'' to ''A'' (in particular gives a structure of ''A''-module).

=== Quotient ring ===
{{main|Quotient ring}}
The '''[[quotient ring]]''' of a ring, is analogous to the notion of a [[quotient group]] of a group. More formally, given a ring (''R'', +, '''·''' ) and a [[Ideal (ring theory)|two-sided ideal]] ''I'' of (''R'', +, '''·''' ), the '''quotient ring''' (or '''factor ring''') ''R/I'' is the set of cosets of ''I'' (with respect to the [[additive group]] of (''R'', +, '''·''' ); i.e. cosets with respect to (''R'', +)) together with the operations:

:(''a'' + ''I'') + (''b'' + ''I'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''I'' and
:(''a'' + ''I'')(''b'' + ''I'') = (''ab'') + ''I''.

for every ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''.

Like the case of a quotient group, there is a canonical map &lt;math&gt;p: R \to R/I&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x + I&lt;/math&gt;. It is surjective and satisfies the universal property: if &lt;math&gt;f:R \to S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;f(I) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a unique &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}: R/I \to S&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;f = \overline{f} \circ p&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, taking ''I'' to be the kernel, one sees that the quotient ring &lt;math&gt;R / \operatorname{ker} f&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the image of ''f''; the fact known as the first [[isomorphism theorem]]. The last fact implies that actually ''any'' surjective ring homomorphism satisfies the universal property since the image of such a map is a quotient ring.
&lt;!-- need more work: A subset of ''R'' and the quotient &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; are related in the following way. A subset of ''R'' is called a [[system of representatives]] of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; if no two elements in the set belong to the same coset; i.e., each element in the set represents a unique coset. It is said to be complete if the restriction of &lt;math&gt;R \to R/I&lt;/math&gt; to it is surjective. --&gt;

== Module ==
{{main|Module (mathematics)}}

The concept of a ''module over a ring'' generalizes the concept of a [[vector space]] (over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) by generalizing from multiplication of vectors with elements of a field ([[scalar multiplication]]) to multiplication with elements of a ring. More precisely, given a ring {{math|''R''}} with 1, an {{math|''R''}}-module {{math|''M''}} is an [[abelian group]] equipped with an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] {{math|''R'' &amp;times; ''M'' → ''M''}} (associating an element of {{math|''M''}} to every pair of an element of {{math|''R''}} and an element of {{math|''M''}}) that satisfies certain [[axiom#Non-logical axioms|axioms]]. This operation is commonly denoted multiplicatively and called multiplication. The axioms of modules are the following: for all {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{math|''R''}} and all {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in {{math|''M''}}, we have:
* {{math|''M''}} is an abelian group under addition.
* &lt;math&gt;a(x+y)=ax+ay&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a+b)x=ax+bx&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1x=x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(ab)x=a(bx)&lt;/math&gt;
When the ring is [[noncommutative ring|noncommutative]] these axioms define ''left modules''; ''right modules'' are defined similarly by writing {{math|''xa''}} instead of {{math|''ax''}}. This is not only a change of notation, as the last axiom of right modules (that is {{math|1=''x''(''ab'') = (''xa'')''b''}}) becomes {{math|1=(''ab'')''x'' = ''b''(''ax'')}}, if left multiplication (by ring elements) is used for a right module.

Basic examples of modules are ideals, including the ring itself.

Although similarly defined, the theory of modules is much more complicated than that of vector space, mainly, because, unlike vector spaces, modules are not characterized (up to an isomorphism) by a single invariant (the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension of a vector space]]). In particular, not all modules have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

The axioms of modules imply that {{math|1=(−1)''x'' = −''x''}}, where the first minus denotes the [[additive inverse]] in the ring and the second minus the additive inverse in the module. Using this and denoting repeated addition by a multiplication by a positive integer allows identifying abelian groups with modules over the ring of integers.

Any ring homomorphism induces a structure of a module: if {{math|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} is a ring homomorphism, then {{math|''S''}} is a left module over {{math|''R''}} by the multiplication: {{nowrap|1=''rs'' = ''f''(''r'')''s''}}. If {{math|''R''}} is commutative or if {{math|''f''(''R'')}} is contained in the [[center of a ring|center]] of {{math|''S''}}, the ring {{math|''S''}} is called a {{math|''R''}}-[[algebra over a ring|algebra]]. In particular, every ring is an algebra over the integers.

== Constructions ==

=== Direct product ===
{{Main|Direct product of rings}}

Let ''R'' and ''S'' be rings. Then the [[cartesian product|product]] {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} can be equipped with the following natural ring structure:

* (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⋅ (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

for every ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R'' and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''S''. The ring {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} with the above operations of addition and multiplication and the multiplicative identity &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[Direct product of rings|direct product]]''' of ''R'' with ''S''. The same construction also works for an arbitrary family of rings: if &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; are rings indexed by a set ''I'', then &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} R_i&lt;/math&gt; is a ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.

Let ''R'' be a commutative ring and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_1, \cdots,  \mathfrak{a}_n&lt;/math&gt; be ideals such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i +  \mathfrak{a}_j = (1)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] says there is a canonical ring isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;R /{\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\mathfrak{a}_i}} \simeq \prod_{i=1}^{n}{R/ \mathfrak{a}_i}, \qquad x \;\operatorname{mod}\; {\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\mathfrak{a}_i}} \mapsto (x \;\operatorname{mod}\; \mathfrak{a}_1, \ldots , x \;\operatorname{mod}\; \mathfrak{a}_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

A "finite" direct product may also be viewed as a direct sum of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=Theorem 4.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, let &lt;math&gt;R_i, 1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt; be rings, &lt;math&gt;R_i \to R = \prod R_i&lt;/math&gt; the inclusions with the images &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; (in particular &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; are rings though not subrings). Then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; are ideals of ''R'' and
:&lt;math&gt;R = \mathfrak{a}_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus  \mathfrak{a}_n, \quad \mathfrak{a}_i \mathfrak{a}_j = 0, i \ne j, \quad \mathfrak{a}_i^2 \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;
as a direct sum of abelian groups (because for abelian groups finite products are the same as direct sums). Clearly the direct sum of such ideals also defines a product of rings that is isomorphic to ''R''. Equivalently, the above can be done through [[central idempotent]]s. Assume ''R'' has the above decomposition. Then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;1 = e_1 + \cdots + e_n, \quad e_i \in \mathfrak{a}_i.&lt;/math&gt;
By the conditions on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;, one has that &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; are central idempotents and &lt;math&gt;e_i e_j = 0, i \ne j&lt;/math&gt; (orthogonal). Again, one can reverse the construction. Namely, if one is given a partition of 1 in orthogonal central idempotents, then let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i = R e_i&lt;/math&gt;, which are two-sided ideals. If each &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a sum of orthogonal central idempotents,&lt;ref&gt;such a central idempotent is called [[centrally primitive]].&lt;/ref&gt; then their direct sum is isomorphic to ''R''.

An important application of an infinite direct product is the construction of a [[projective limit]] of rings (see below). Another application is a [[restricted product]] of a family of rings (cf. [[adele ring]]).

=== Polynomial ring ===
{{main|Polynomial ring}}

Given a symbol ''t'' (called a variable) and a commutative ring ''R'', the set of polynomials

: &lt;math&gt;R[t] = \left\{ a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n -1} + \dots + a_1 t + a_0  \mid n \ge 0, a_j \in R \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

forms a commutative ring with the usual addition and multiplication, containing ''R'' as a subring. It is called the [[polynomial ring]] over ''R''. More generally, the set &lt;math&gt;R[t_1, \ldots, t_n]&lt;/math&gt; of all polynomials in variables &lt;math&gt;t_1, \ldots, t_n&lt;/math&gt; forms a commutative ring, containing &lt;math&gt;R[t_i]&lt;/math&gt; as subrings.

If ''R'' is an integral domain, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is also an integral domain; its field of fractions is the field of [[rational function]]s. If ''R'' is a noetherian ring, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a noetherian ring. If ''R'' is a unique factorization domain, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a unique factorization domain. Finally, ''R'' is a field if and only if &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a principal ideal domain.

Let &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; be commutative rings. Given an element ''x'' of ''S'', one can consider the ring homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;R[t] \to S, \quad f \mapsto f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., the [[Substitution (algebra)|substitution]]). If ''S''=''R''[''t''] and ''x''=''t'', then ''f''(''t'')=''f''. Because of this, the polynomial ''f'' is often also denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The image of the map &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;; it is the same thing as the subring of ''S'' generated by ''R'' and ''x''.

Example: &lt;math&gt;k[t^2, t^3]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the image of the homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;k[x, y] \to k[t], \, f \mapsto f(t^2, t^3).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, it is the subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; generated by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Example: let ''f'' be a polynomial in one variable; i.e., an element in a polynomial ring ''R''. Then &lt;math&gt;f(x+h)&lt;/math&gt; is an element in &lt;math&gt;R[h]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x+h) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''h'' in that ring. The result of substituting zero to ''h'' in &lt;math&gt;(f(x+h) - f(x))/h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.

The substitution is a special case of the universal property of a polynomial ring. The property states: given a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi: R \to S&lt;/math&gt; and an element ''x'' in ''S'' there exists a unique ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}: R[t] \to S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}(t) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; restricts to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|1974|loc=Theorem 2.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, choosing a basis, a [[symmetric algebra]] satisfies the universal property and so is a polynomial ring.

To give an example, let ''S'' be the ring of all functions from ''R'' to itself; the addition and the multiplication are those of functions. Let ''x'' be the identity function. Each ''r'' in ''R'' defines a constant function, giving rise to the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;. The universal property says that this map extends uniquely to
:&lt;math&gt;R[t] \to S, \quad f \mapsto \overline{f}&lt;/math&gt;
(''t'' maps to ''x'') where &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polynomial function]] defined by ''f''. The resulting map is injective if and only if ''R'' is infinite.

Given a non-constant monic polynomial ''f'' in &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a ring ''S'' containing ''R'' such that ''f'' is a product of linear factors in &lt;math&gt;S[t]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|Algèbre commutative|loc=Ch 5. §1, Lemma 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''k'' be an algebraically closed field. The [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] (theorem of zeros) states that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of all prime ideals in &lt;math&gt;k[t_1, \ldots, t_n]&lt;/math&gt; and the set of closed subvarieties of &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, many local problems in algebraic geometry may be attacked through the study of the generators of an ideal in a polynomial ring. (cf. [[Gröbner basis]].)

There are some other related constructions. A [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;R[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt; consists of formal power series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_0^\infty a_i t^i, \quad a_i \in R&lt;/math&gt;
together with multiplication and addition that mimic those for convergent series. It contains &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; as a subring. Note a formal power series ring does not have the universal property of a polynomial ring; a series may not converge after a substitution. The important advantage of a formal power series ring over a polynomial ring is that it is [[local ring|local]] (in fact, [[complete ring|complete]]).

=== Matrix ring and endomorphism ring ===
{{Main|Matrix ring|Endomorphism ring}}

Let ''R'' be a ring (not necessarily commutative). The set of all square matrices of size ''n'' with entries in ''R'' forms a ring with the entry-wise addition and the usual [[matrix multiplication]]. It is called the [[matrix ring]] and is denoted by M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''). Given a right ''R''-module &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all ''R''-linear maps from ''U'' to itself forms a ring with addition that is of function and multiplication that is of [[composition of functions]]; it is called the endomorphism ring of ''U'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt;.

As in linear algebra, a matrix ring may be canonically interpreted as an endomorphism ring: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(R^n) \simeq \operatorname{M}_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case of the following fact: If &lt;math&gt;f: \oplus_1^n U \to \oplus_1^n U&lt;/math&gt; is an ''R''-linear map, then ''f'' may be written as a matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S = \operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the ring isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(\oplus_1^n U) \to \operatorname{M}_n(S), \quad f \mapsto (f_{ij}).&lt;/math&gt;

Any ring homomorphism ''R'' → ''S'' induces {{nowrap|M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') → M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}}; in fact, any ring homomorphism between matrix rings arises in this way.&lt;ref name="Cohn matrix"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schur's lemma]] says that if ''U'' is a simple right ''R''-module, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt; is a division ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch. XVII. Proposition 1.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle U = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^r U_i^{\oplus m_i}&lt;/math&gt; is a direct sum of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-copies of simple ''R''-modules &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U) \simeq \bigoplus_1^r \operatorname{M}_{m_i} (\operatorname{End}_R(U_i))&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] states any [[semisimple ring]] (cf. below) is of this form.

A ring ''R'' and the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') over it are [[Morita equivalent]]: the category of right modules of ''R'' is equivalent to the category of right modules over M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').&lt;ref name="Cohn matrix" /&gt; In particular, two-sided ideals in ''R'' correspond in one-to-one to two-sided ideals in M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

Examples:
* The automorphisms of the [[projective line over a ring]] are given by [[homography|homographies]] from the 2 x 2 matrix ring.

=== Limits and colimits of rings ===
Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence of rings such that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subring of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i''. Then the union (or [[filtered colimit]]) of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ring &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim R_i&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows: it is the disjoint union of all ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for sufficiently large ''i''.

Examples of colimits:
* A polynomial ring in infinitely many variables: &lt;math&gt;R[t_1, t_2, \cdots] = \varinjlim R[t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_m].&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[algebraic closure]] of [[finite field]]s of the same characteristic &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p = \varinjlim \mathbf{F}_{p^m}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The field of [[formal Laurent series]] over a field ''k'': &lt;math&gt;k(\!(t)\!) = \varinjlim t^{-m}k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt; (it is the field of fractions of the [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.)
* The [[function field of an algebraic variety]] over a field ''k'' is &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim k[U]&lt;/math&gt; where the limit runs over all the coordinate rings &lt;math&gt;k[U]&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty open subsets ''U'' (more succinctly it is the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the structure sheaf at the [[generic point]].)

Any commutative ring is the colimit of [[finitely generated ring|finitely generated subrings]].&lt;!-- non-commutative case? --&gt;

A [[projective limit]] (or a [[filtered limit]]) of rings is defined as follows. Suppose we're given a family of rings &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' running over positive integers, say, and ring homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;R_j \to R_i, j \ge i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R_i \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; are all the identities and &lt;math&gt;R_k \to R_j \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;R_k \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;k \ge j \ge i&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\varprojlim R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the subring of &lt;math&gt;\prod R_i&lt;/math&gt; consisting of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; maps to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;R_j \to R_i, j \ge i&lt;/math&gt;.

For an example of a projective limit, see {{slink||Completion}}.

=== Localization ===
The [[localization of a ring|localization]] generalizes the construction of the [[field of fractions]] of an integral domain to an arbitrary ring and modules. Given a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''R'' and a subset ''S'' of ''R'', there exists a ring &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; together with the ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; that "inverts" ''S''; that is, the homomorphism maps elements in ''S'' to unit elements in &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, and, moreover, any ring homomorphism from ''R'' that "inverts" ''S'' uniquely factors through &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=Proposition 1.3.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''localization''' of ''R'' with respect to ''S''. For example, if ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''f'' an element in ''R'', then the localization &lt;math&gt;R[f^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; consists of elements of the form &lt;math&gt;r/f^n, \, r \in R , \, n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (to be precise, &lt;math&gt;R[f^{-1}] = R[t]/(tf - 1).&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|2004|loc=Exercise 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The localization is frequently applied to a commutative ring ''R'' with respect to the complement of a prime ideal (or a union of prime ideals) in ''R''. In that case &lt;math&gt;S = R - \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, one often writes &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is then a local ring with the maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the reason for the terminology "localization". The field of fractions of an integral domain ''R'' is the localization of ''R'' at the prime ideal zero. If
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a prime ideal of a commutative ring ''R'', then the field of fractions of &lt;math&gt;R/\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the residue field of the local ring &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;k(\mathfrak{p})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- In algebraic geometry, the field of fractions is the localization at the "[[generic point]]" --&gt;

If ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, then the localization of ''M'' with respect to ''S'' is given by a [[change of rings]] &lt;math&gt;M[S^{-1}] = R[S^{-1}] \otimes_R M&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- intuitively, M_p corresponds to the fiber over ''p'' in ''M''. In particular, there is the canonical map &lt;math&gt;M \to M[S^{-1}], \, m \mapsto m / 1&lt;/math&gt;. Its kernel consists of elements ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;sm = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some ''s'' in ''S''. --&gt;

The most important properties of localization are the following: when ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''S'' a multiplicatively closed subset
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} \mapsto \mathfrak{p}[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection between the set of all prime ideals in ''R'' disjoint from ''S'' and the set of all prime ideals in &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=Proposition 6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}] = \varinjlim R[f^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, ''f'' running over elements in ''S'' with partial ordering given by divisibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=The end of Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The localization is exact:
*: &lt;math&gt;0 \to M'[S^{-1}] \to M[S^{-1}] \to M''[S^{-1}] \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact over &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact over ''R''.
* Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;0 \to M'_\mathfrak{m} \to M_\mathfrak{m} \to M''_\mathfrak{m} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact for any maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact.
* A remark: localization is no help in proving a global existence. One instance of this is that if two modules are isomorphic at all prime ideals, it does not follow that they are isomorphic. (One way to explain this is that the localization allows one to view a module as a sheaf over prime ideals and a sheaf is inherently a local notion.)

In category theory, a [[localization of a category]] amounts to making some morphisms isomorphisms. An element in a commutative ring ''R'' may be thought of as an endomorphism of any ''R''-module. Thus, categorically, a localization of ''R'' with respect to a subset ''S'' of ''R'' is a functor from the category of ''R''-modules to itself that sends elements of ''S'' viewed as endomorphisms to automorphisms and is universal with respect to this property. (Of course, ''R'' then maps to &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; and ''R''-modules map to &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-modules.)

=== Completion ===
Let ''R'' be a commutative ring, and let ''I'' be an ideal of ''R''.
The '''[[Completion (ring theory)|completion]]''' of ''R'' at ''I'' is the projective limit &lt;math&gt;\hat{R} = \varprojlim R/I^n&lt;/math&gt;; it is a commutative ring. The canonical homomorphisms from ''R'' to the quotients &lt;math&gt;R/I^n&lt;/math&gt; induce a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to \hat{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The latter homomorphism is injective if ''R'' is a noetherian integral domain and ''I'' is a proper ideal, or if ''R'' is a noetherian local ring with maximal ideal ''I'', by [[Krull's intersection theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah and Macdonald, Theorem 10.17 and its corollaries.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is especially useful when ''I'' is a maximal ideal.

The basic example is the completion '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''Z''' at the principal ideal (''p'') generated by a prime number ''p''; it is called the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]. The completion can in this case be constructed also from the [[p-adic absolute value|''p''-adic absolute value]] on '''Q'''. The ''p''-adic absolute value on '''Q''' is a map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto |x|&lt;/math&gt; from '''Q''' to '''R''' given by &lt;math&gt;|n|_p=p^{-v_p(n)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v_p(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the exponent of ''p'' in the prime factorization of a nonzero integer ''n'' into prime numbers (we also put &lt;math&gt;|0|_p=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|m/n|_p = |m|_p/|n|_p&lt;/math&gt;). It defines a distance function on '''Q''' and the completion of '''Q''' as a [[metric space]] is denoted by '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is again a field since the field operations extend to the completion. The subring of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of elements ''x'' with &lt;math&gt;|x|_p \le 1&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, the formal power series ring &lt;math&gt;R[{[t]}]&lt;/math&gt; is the completion of &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(t)&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Hensel's lemma]])&lt;!-- need to be discussed with concrete examples. Start of a para: The notion of the completion formalizes the construction of a solution by successive approximation. --&gt;

A complete ring has much simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the [[Cohen structure theorem]], which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends to look like a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the [[integral closure]] and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of [[excellent ring]].

=== Rings with generators and relations ===
The most general way to construct a ring is by specifying generators and relations. Let ''F'' be a [[free ring]] (i.e., free algebra over the integers) with the set ''X'' of symbols; i.e., ''F'' consists of polynomials with integral coefficients in noncommuting variables that are elements of ''X''. A free ring satisfies the universal property: any function from the set ''X'' to a ring ''R'' factors through ''F'' so that &lt;math&gt;F \to R&lt;/math&gt; is the unique ring homomorphism. Just as in the group case, every ring can be represented as a quotient of a free ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-4ADgUgpSMC&amp;pg=PA242 pg. 242]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, we can impose relations among symbols in ''X'' by taking a quotient. Explicitly, if ''E'' is a subset of ''F'', then the quotient ring of ''F'' by the ideal generated by ''E'' is called the ring with generators ''X'' and relations ''E''. If we used a ring, say, ''A'' as a base ring instead of '''Z''', then the resulting ring will be over ''A''. For example, if &lt;math&gt;E = \{ xy - yx \mid x, y \in X \}&lt;/math&gt;, then the resulting ring will be the usual polynomial ring with coefficients in ''A'' in variables that are elements of ''X'' (It is also the same thing as the [[symmetric algebra]] over ''A'' with symbols ''X''.)

In the category-theoretic terms, the formation &lt;math&gt;S \mapsto \text{the free ring generated by the set } S&lt;/math&gt; is the left adjoint functor of the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of rings to '''Set''' (and it is often called the free ring functor.)&lt;!-- Note: we need to discuss a ring as a solution to a universal problem with some specific application. --&gt;

Let ''A'', ''B'' be algebras over a commutative ring ''R''. Then the tensor product of ''R''-modules &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_R B&lt;/math&gt; is a ''R''-module. We can turn it to a ring by extending linearly &lt;math&gt;(x \otimes u) (y \otimes v) = xy \otimes uv&lt;/math&gt;. See also: [[tensor product of algebras]], [[change of rings]].

== Special kinds of rings ==

=== Domains ===
A [[zero ring|nonzero]] ring with no nonzero [[zero-divisor]]s is called a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]. A commutative domain is called an [[integral domain]]. The most important integral domains are principal ideals domains, PID for short, and fields. A principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. An important class of integral domains that contain a PID is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD), an integral domain in which every nonunit element is a product of [[prime element]]s (an element is prime if it generates a [[prime ideal]].) The fundamental question in [[algebraic number theory]] is on the extent to which the [[ring of integers|ring of (generalized) integers]] in a [[number field]], where an "ideal" admits prime factorization, fails to be a PID.

Among theorems concerning a PID, the most important one is the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. The theorem may be illustrated by the following application to linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch XIV, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field ''k'' and &lt;math&gt;f: V \to V&lt;/math&gt; a linear map with minimal polynomial ''q''. Then, since &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a unique factorization domain, ''q'' factors into powers of distinct irreducible polynomials (i.e., prime elements):
:&lt;math&gt;q = p_1^{e_1} ... p_s^{e_s}.&lt;/math&gt;
Letting &lt;math&gt;t \cdot v = f(v)&lt;/math&gt;, we make ''V'' a ''k''[''t'']-module. The structure theorem then says ''V'' is a direct sum of [[cyclic module]]s, each of which is isomorphic to the module of the form &lt;math&gt;k[t]/(p_i^{k_j})&lt;/math&gt;. Now, if &lt;math&gt;p_i(t) = t - \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, then such a cyclic module (for &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;) has a basis in which the restriction of ''f'' is represented by a [[Jordan matrix]]. Thus, if, say, ''k'' is algebraically closed, then all &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are of the form &lt;math&gt;t - \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; and the above decomposition corresponds to the [[Jordan canonical form]] of ''f''.

In algebraic geometry, UFDs arise because of smoothness. More precisely, a point in a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at the point is a [[regular local ring]]. A regular local ring is a UFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weibel|loc=Ch 1, Theorem 3.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a chain of [[subclass (set theory)|class inclusions]] that describes the relationship between rings, domains and fields:

: '''[[Commutative ring]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integral domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integrally closed domain]]s''' ⊃'''[[unique factorization domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[principal ideal domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[Euclidean domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[field (mathematics)|fields]]'''

=== Division ring ===
A [[division ring]] is a ring such that every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division ring is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A prominent example of a division ring that is not a field is the ring of [[quaternion]]s. Any centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In particular, the center of a division ring is a field. It turned out that every ''finite'' domain (in particular finite division ring) is a field; in particular commutative (the [[Wedderburn's little theorem]]).

Every module over a division ring is a free module (has a basis); consequently, much of linear algebra can be carried out over a division ring instead of a field.

The study of conjugacy classes figures prominently in the classical theory of division rings. Cartan famously asked the following question: given a division ring ''D'' and a proper sub-division-ring ''S'' that is not contained in the center, does each inner automorphism of ''D'' restrict to an automorphism of ''S''? The answer is negative: this is the [[Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem]].
&lt;!-- need more context. To give a concrete example, we consider a division ring ''D'' whose center ''k'' is the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt; of ''p''-adic rational numbers (or more generally a nonarchimedean local field).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuation of ''k'' uniquely extends to any subfield of ''D''. Since ''D'' is a union of subfields, we thus obtain the valuation ''v'' of ''D''. (This has to be verified; it is not a priori obvious that ''v'' is indeed a valuation). Define
:&lt;math&gt;O_D = \{ x \in D | v(x) \ge 0 \}, \quad \mathfrak{P} = \{ x \in D | v(x) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;O_D&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of ''D'' with the unique maximal ideal that is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;. It is called the [[ring of integers]] of ''D''.--&gt;

A [[cyclic algebra]], introduced by [[L. E. Dickson]], is a generalization of a [[quaternion algebra]].

=== Semisimple rings ===
A ring is called a [[semisimple ring]] if it is [[semisimple module|semisimple as a left module]] (or right module) over itself; i.e., a direct sum of simple modules. A ring is called a [[semiprimitive ring]] if its [[Jacobson radical]] is zero. (The Jacobson radical is the intersection of all maximal left ideals.) A ring is semisimple if and only if it is [[artinian ring|artinian]] and is semiprimitive.

An algebra over a field ''k'' is artinian if and only if it has finite dimension. Thus, a semisimple algebra over a field is necessarily finite-dimensional, while a simple algebra may have infinite dimension; e.g., the [[ring of differential operators]].

Any module over a semisimple ring is semisimple. (Proof: any free module over a semisimple ring is clearly semisimple and any module is a quotient of a free module.)

Examples of semisimple rings:
* A matrix ring over a division ring is semisimple (actually simple).
* The group ring &lt;math&gt;k[G]&lt;/math&gt; of a finite group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is semisimple if the characteristic of ''k'' does not divide the order of ''G''. ([[Maschke's theorem]])
* The [[Weyl algebra]] (over a field) is a simple ring; it is not semisimple since it has infinite dimension and thus not artinian.
* [[Clifford algebra]]s are semisimple.

Semisimplicity is closely related to separability. An [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' over a field ''k'' is said to be [[separable algebra|separable]] if the base extension &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple for any [[field extension]] &lt;math&gt;F/k&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' happens to be a field, then this is equivalent to the usual definition in field theory (cf. [[separable extension]].)

=== Central simple algebra and Brauer group ===
{{main|Central simple algebra}}

For a field ''k'', a ''k''-algebra is central if its center is ''k'' and is simple if it is a [[simple ring]]. Since the center of a simple ''k''-algebra is a field, any simple ''k''-algebra is a central simple algebra over its center. In this section, a central simple algebra is assumed to have finite dimension. Also, we mostly fix the base field; thus, an algebra refers to a ''k''-algebra. The matrix ring of size ''n'' over a ring ''R'' will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Skolem–Noether theorem]] states any automorphism of a central simple algebra is inner.

Two central simple algebras ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be ''similar'' if there are integers ''n'' and ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k k_n \approx B \otimes_k k_m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §2"&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;k_n \otimes_k k_m \simeq k_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;, the similarity is an equivalence relation. The similarity classes &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; with the multiplication &lt;math&gt;[A][B] = [A \otimes_k B]&lt;/math&gt; form an abelian group called the [[Brauer group]] of ''k'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k)&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]], a central simple algebra is the matrix ring of a division ring; thus, each similarity class is represented by a unique division ring.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial if ''k'' is a finite field or an algebraically closed field (more generally [[quasi-algebraically closed field]]; cf. [[Tsen's theorem]]). &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; has order 2 (a special case of the [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|theorem of Frobenius]]). Finally, if ''k'' is a nonarchimedean [[local field]] (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k) = \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; through the [[Hasse invariant of an algebra|invariant map]].

Now, if ''F'' is a field extension of ''k'', then the base extension &lt;math&gt;- \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; induces &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k) \to \operatorname{Br}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Its kernel is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(F/k)&lt;/math&gt;. It consists of &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix ring over ''F'' (i.e., ''A'' is split by ''F''.) If the extension is finite and Galois, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(F/k)&lt;/math&gt; is canonically isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;H^2(\operatorname{Gal}(F/k), k^*)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Serre, J-P ., Applications algébriques de la cohomologie des groupes, I, II, Séminaire Henri Cartan, 1950/51 [http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1950-1951__3_]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azumaya algebra]]s generalize the notion of central simple algebras to a commutative local ring.

=== Valuation ring ===
{{main|valuation ring}}

If ''K'' is a field, a [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] ''v'' is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to a totally ordered abelian group ''G'' such that, for any ''f'', ''g'' in ''K'' with ''f'' + ''g'' nonzero, ''v''(''f'' + ''g'') ≥ min{''v''(''f''), ''v''(''g'')}. The [[valuation ring]] of ''v'' is the subring of ''K'' consisting of zero and all nonzero ''f'' such that ''v''(''f'') ≥ 0.

Examples:
* The field of [[formal Laurent series]] &lt;math&gt;k(\!(t)\!)&lt;/math&gt; over a field ''k'' comes with the valuation ''v'' such that ''v''(''f'') is the least degree of a nonzero term in ''f''; the valuation ring of ''v'' is the [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, given a field ''k'' and a totally ordered abelian group ''G'', let &lt;math&gt;k(\!(G)\!)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all functions from ''G'' to ''k'' whose supports (the sets of points at which the functions are nonzero) are [[well ordered]]. It is a field with the multiplication given by [[convolution]]:
*: &lt;math&gt;(f*g)(t) = \sum_{s \in G} f(s)g(t-s)&lt;/math&gt;.
:It also comes with the valuation ''v'' such that ''v''(''f'') is the least element in the support of ''f''. The subring consisting of elements with finite support is called the [[group ring]] of ''G'' (which makes sense even if ''G'' is not commutative). If ''G'' is the ring of integers, then we recover the previous example (by identifying ''f'' with the series whose ''n''-th coefficient is ''f''(''n'').)

See also: [[Novikov ring]] and [[uniserial ring]].

== Rings with extra structure ==

A ring may be viewed as an [[abelian group]] (by using the addition operation), with extra structure: namely, ring multiplication. In the same way, there are other mathematical objects which may be considered as rings with extra structure. For example:
* An [[associative algebra]] is a ring that is also a [[vector space]] over a field ''K'' such that the scalar multiplication distributes over the ring multiplication. For instance, the set of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over the real field '''R''' has dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as a real vector space.
* A ring ''R'' is a [[topological ring]] if its set of elements ''R'' is given a [[topological space|topology]] which makes the addition map ( &lt;math&gt;+ : R\times R \to R\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the multiplication map ( &lt;math&gt;\cdot : R\times R \to R\,&lt;/math&gt;) to be both [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] as maps between topological spaces (where ''X'' × ''X'' inherits the [[product topology]] or any other product in the category). For example, ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over the real numbers could be given either the [[Euclidean topology]], or the [[Zariski topology]], and in either case one would obtain a topological ring.
* A [[λ-ring]] is a commutative ring ''R'' together with operations λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''R'' → ''R'' that are like ''n''-th [[exterior power]]s:
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda^n(x + y) = \sum_0^n \lambda^i(x) \lambda^{n-i}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
:For example, '''Z''' is a λ-ring with &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n(x) = \binom{x}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[binomial coefficient]]s. The notion plays a central rule in the algebraic approach to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].
* A [[totally ordered ring]] is a ring with a [[total ordering]] that is compatible with ring operations.&lt;!-- Z is characterized as a certain unique ordered ring. Can’t remember the precise statement.--&gt;

== Some examples of the ubiquity of rings ==

Many different kinds of [[mathematical object]]s can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of some [[functor|associated ring]].

=== Cohomology ring of a topological space ===
To any [[topological space]] ''X'' one can associate its integral [[cohomology ring]]
:&lt;math&gt;H^*(X,\mathbb{Z}) = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty} H^i(X,\mathbb{Z}),&lt;/math&gt;
a [[graded ring]]. There are also [[homology group]]s &lt;math&gt;H_i(X,\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; of a space, and indeed these were defined first, as a useful tool for distinguishing between certain pairs of topological spaces, like the [[sphere]]s and [[torus|tori]], for which the methods of [[point-set topology]] are not well-suited. [[Cohomology group]]s were later defined in terms of homology groups in a way which is roughly analogous to the dual of a [[vector space]]. To know each individual integral homology group is essentially the same as knowing each individual integral cohomology group, because of the [[universal coefficient theorem]]. However, the advantage of the cohomology groups is that there is a [[cup product|natural product]], which is analogous to the observation that one can multiply pointwise a ''k''-[[multilinear form]] and an ''l''-multilinear form to get a (''k'' + ''l'')-multilinear form.

The ring structure in cohomology provides the foundation for [[characteristic class]]es of [[fiber bundle]]s, intersection theory on manifolds and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], [[Schubert calculus]] and much more.

=== Burnside ring of a group ===
To any [[group (mathematics)|group]] is associated its [[Burnside ring]] which uses a ring to describe the various ways the group can [[group action|act]] on a finite set. The Burnside ring's additive group is the [[free abelian group]] whose basis are the transitive actions of the group and whose addition is the disjoint union of the action. Expressing an action in terms of the basis is decomposing an action into its transitive constituents. The multiplication is easily expressed in terms of the [[representation ring]]: the multiplication in the Burnside ring is formed by writing the tensor product of two permutation modules as a permutation module. The ring structure allows a formal way of subtracting one action from another. Since the Burnside ring is contained as a finite index subring of the representation ring, one can pass easily from one to the other by extending the coefficients from integers to the rational numbers.

=== Representation ring of a group ring ===
To any [[group ring]] or [[Hopf algebra]] is associated its [[representation ring]] or "Green ring". The representation ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the indecomposable modules and whose addition corresponds to the direct sum. Expressing a module in terms of the basis is finding an indecomposable decomposition of the module. The multiplication is the tensor product. When the algebra is semisimple, the representation ring is just the character ring from [[character theory]], which is more or less the [[Grothendieck group]] given a ring structure.

=== Function field of an irreducible algebraic variety ===
To any irreducible [[algebraic variety]] is associated its [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]]. The points of an algebraic variety correspond to [[valuation ring]]s contained in the function field and containing the [[coordinate ring]]. The study of [[algebraic geometry]] makes heavy use of [[commutative algebra]] to study geometric concepts in terms of ring-theoretic properties. [[Birational geometry]] studies maps between the subrings of the function field.

=== Face ring of a simplicial complex ===
Every [[simplicial complex]] has an associated face ring, also called its [[Stanley–Reisner ring]]. This ring reflects many of the combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex, so it is of particular interest in [[algebraic combinatorics]]. In particular, the algebraic geometry of the Stanley–Reisner ring was used to characterize the numbers of faces in each dimension of [[simplicial polytope]]s.

== Category theoretical description ==
{{main|Category of rings}}

Every ring can be thought of as a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in '''Ab''', the [[category of abelian groups]] (thought of as a [[monoidal category]] under the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}&lt;/math&gt;-modules]]). The monoid action of a ring ''R'' on an abelian group is simply an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]]. Essentially, an ''R''-module is a generalization of the notion of a [[vector space]] – where rather than a vector space over a field, one has a "vector space over a ring".

Let (''A'', +) be an abelian group and let End(''A'') be its [[endomorphism ring]] (see above). Note that, essentially, End(''A'') is the set of all morphisms of ''A'', where if ''f'' is in End(''A''), and ''g'' is in End(''A''), the following rules may be used to compute ''f'' + ''g'' and ''f'' '''·''' ''g'':

* (''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')
* (''f'' '''·''' ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))

where + as in ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'') is addition in ''A'', and function composition is denoted from right to left. Therefore, [[functor|associated]] to any abelian group, is a ring. Conversely, given any ring, (''R'', +, '''·''' ), (''R'', +) is an abelian group. Furthermore, for every ''r'' in ''R'', right (or left) multiplication by ''r'' gives rise to a morphism of (''R'', +), by right (or left) distributivity. Let ''A'' = (''R'', +). Consider those [[endomorphism]]s of ''A'', that "factor through" right (or left) multiplication of ''R''. In other words, let End&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') be the set of all morphisms ''m'' of ''A'', having the property that ''m''(''r'' '''·''' ''x'') = ''r'' '''·''' ''m''(''x''). It was seen that every ''r'' in ''R'' gives rise to a morphism of ''A'': right multiplication by ''r''. It is in fact true that this association of any element of ''R'', to a morphism of ''A'', as a function from ''R'' to End&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), is an isomorphism of rings. In this sense, therefore, any ring can be viewed as the endomorphism ring of some abelian ''X''-group (by ''X''-group, it is meant a group with ''X'' being its [[Group with operators|set of operators]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the most general form of a ring, is the endomorphism group of some abelian ''X''-group.

Any ring can be seen as a [[preadditive category]] with a single object. It is therefore natural to consider arbitrary preadditive categories to be generalizations of rings. And indeed, many definitions and theorems originally given for rings can be translated to this more general context. [[Additive functor]]s between preadditive categories generalize the concept of ring homomorphism, and ideals in additive categories can be defined as sets of [[morphism]]s closed under addition and under composition with arbitrary morphisms.

== Generalization ==

Algebraists have defined structures more general than rings by weakening or dropping some of ring axioms.

=== Rng ===
A [[rng (algebra)|rng]] is the same as a ring, except that the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]] is not assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonassociative ring ===
A [[nonassociative ring]] is an algebraic structure that satisfies all of the ring axioms except the [[associative property]] and the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]]. A notable example is a [[Lie algebra]]. There exists some structure theory&lt;!-- developed by Jacobson? --&gt; for such algebras that generalizes the analogous results for Lie algebras and associative algebras.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Semiring ===
A [[semiring]] is obtained by weakening the assumption that (''R'',+) is an abelian group to the assumption that (''R'',+) is a commutative monoid, and adding the axiom that 0 · ''a'' = ''a'' · 0 = 0 for all ''a'' in ''R'' (since it no longer follows from the other axioms).

Example: a [[tropical semiring]].

== Other ring-like objects ==

=== Ring object in a category ===
Let ''C'' be a category with finite products. Let pt denote a [[terminal object]] of ''C'' (an empty product). A '''ring object''' in ''C'' is an object ''R'' equipped with morphisms &lt;math&gt;R \times R \stackrel{a}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (addition), &lt;math&gt;R \times R \stackrel{m}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (multiplication), &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pt} \stackrel{0}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (additive identity), &lt;math&gt;R \stackrel{i}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (additive inverse), and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pt} \stackrel{1}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (multiplicative identity) satisfying the usual ring axioms. Equivalently, a ring object is an object ''R'' equipped with a factorization of its functor of points &lt;math&gt;h_R = \operatorname{Hom}(-,R) : C^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathbf{Sets}&lt;/math&gt; through the category of rings: &lt;math&gt;C^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathbf{Rings} \stackrel{\textrm{forgetful}}\longrightarrow \mathbf{Sets}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Ring scheme ===
In algebraic geometry, a '''ring scheme''' over a base [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] {{math|''S''}} is a ring object in the category of {{math|''S''}}-schemes. One example is the ring scheme {{math|W&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} over {{math|Spec '''Z'''}}, which for any commutative ring {{math|''A''}} returns the ring {{math|W&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')}} of {{math|''p''}}-isotypic Witt vectors of length {{math|''n''}} over {{math|''A''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Serre, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ring spectrum ===
In [[algebraic topology]], a [[ring spectrum]] is a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] ''X'' together with a multiplication &lt;math&gt;\mu \colon X \wedge X \to X&lt;/math&gt; and a unit map &lt;math&gt;S \to X&lt;/math&gt; from the [[sphere spectrum]] ''S'', such that the ring axiom diagrams commute up to homotopy. In practice, it is common to define a ring spectrum as a [[monoid object]] in a good category of spectra such as the category of [[symmetric spectrum|symmetric spectra]].

A '''role''' (also '''rôle''' or '''social role''') is a set of connected [[behavior]]s, [[rights]], [[moral obligation|obligation]]s, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. It is an expected or free or continuously changing behaviour and may have a given individual [[social status]] or [[social position]]. It is vital to both [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] and [[interactionism|interactionist]] understandings of society.
Social role posits the following about social behaviour:
# The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialised [[Social position|positions]], we call roles.
# Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behaviour and actions that recur in a group, guided by social [[norm (sociology)|norms]], which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behaviour in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society.
# Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called [[Actor (UML)|actors]].
# When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] and [[constructive]]), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to [[Social control|punish those who violate]] role norms.
# Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change.
# The anticipation of [[Reinforcement|rewards]] and [[punishment]]s, as well as the satisfaction of behaving prosocially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.

The notion of the role is examined in the [[social sciences]], more specifically [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[organisation theory]].

==Determinants and characteristics==
Roles may be [[achieved status|achieved]] or [[ascribed status|ascribed]] or they can be accidental in different situations. An ''achieved role'' is a position that a person assumes voluntarily which reflects personal skills, abilities, and effort. An ''ascribed role'' is a position assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, {{Harv|Stark|2007}}, and is usually forced upon a person.

Roles can be semi-permanent ("[[physician|doctor]]", "mother", "child"), or they can be transitory. A well-known example is the ''[[sick role]]'' as formulated by [[Talcott Parsons]] in the late 1940s. In the transitory "sick role", a person is exempted from their usual roles, but is expected to conform to transitory behavioural standards, such as following doctors' orders and trying to recover.

For many roles, individuals must meet certain conditions, biological or sociological. For instance, a boy cannot ordinarily take the biological role of mother. Other roles require training or experience. For instance, in many cultures doctors must be educated and certified before practising medicine.

Role development can be influenced by a number of additional factors, including [[social]], [[Genetics|genetic]] predisposition, [[cultural]] or [[situational]].
*Societal influence: The structure of society often forms individuals into certain roles based on the social situations they choose to experience. Parents enrolling their children in certain programs at a young age increases the chance that the child will follow that role.
*Genetic predisposition: People take on roles that come naturally to them. Those with athletic ability generally take on roles of athletes. Those with mental genius often take on roles devoted to education and knowledge. This does not mean that people must choose only one path, each individual can reprise multiple roles (i.e. Evelyn can be the point guard on the basketball team and the editor of her school newspaper).
*Cultural influence: Different cultures place different values on certain roles based on their lifestyle. For instance, [[Association football|soccer]] players are regarded higher in European countries than in the [[United States]], where soccer is less popular.
*Situational influence: Roles can be created or altered based on the situation a person is put in outside their own influence.

Roles are also frequently interconnected in a [[role set]], that complement of role-relationships in which persons are involved by virtue of occupying a particular social status {{Harv|Merton|1957}}. For example, a high school football player carries the roles of student, athlete, classmate, etc.

== Role theory ==
{{Main|Role theory}}
Role theory is the sociological study of role development, concerned with explaining what forces cause people to develop the expectations of their own and others' behaviours.&lt;ref name="Biddle"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last=Biddle | first=B.J.
 | year=1986
 | title=Recent Developments in Role Theory

 | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.12.080186.000435
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Bruce Biddle (1986), the five major models of role theory include:&lt;ref name="Biddle"/&gt;
#Functional Role Theory, which examines role development as shared social norms for a given social position,
#Symbolic Interactionist Role Theory, which examines role development as the outcome of individual interpretation of responses to behaviour,
#Structural Role Theory, which emphasises the influence of society rather than the individual in roles and utilises mathematical models,
#Organizational Role Theory, which examines role development in organisations, and
#Cognitive Role Theory, which is summarised by Flynn and Lemay as "the relationship between expectations and behaviours"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Robert John | last = Flynn |author2=Raymond A. Lemay  | title = A Quarter-Century of Normalization and Social Role Valorization: Evolution and Impact | publisher = University of Ottawa Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7766-0485-6 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=n14-2xhMz2cC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22Structural+Role+Theory%22+definition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in functionalist and consensus theory===
The [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] approach to role theory, which is largely borrowed from [[anthropology]], sees a "role" as the set of expectations that [[society]] places on an individual. By unspoken consensus, certain behaviours are deemed "appropriate" and others "inappropriate". For example, an appropriate [[Physician|doctor]] dresses fairly conservatively, asks a series of personal questions about one's health, touches one in ways that would normally be forbidden, writes [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]], and shows more concern for the personal [[Quality of life|wellbeing]] of his or her clients than is expected of, say, an [[electrician]] or a [[shopkeeper]].

"Role" is what the doctor ''does'' (or, at least, is expected to do) while status is what the doctor  ''is; ''in other words, "status" is the position an actor occupies, while "role" is the expected behaviour attached to that position.  Roles are not limited to occupational status, of course, nor does the fact that one is cast in the role of "doctor" during working hours prevent one from taking on other roles at other times: husband/wife, friend, father/mother, and so on.

===Role in interactionist or social action theory===
In interactionist social theory, the concept of role is crucial. The interactionist definition of "role" pre-dates the functionalist one. A role, in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals in a tentative, creative way. [[philosophy|Philosopher]] [[George Herbert Mead]] explored roles in his seminal 1934 work, ''Mind, self and society''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=Mead | first=George H.
 | author-link=George Herbert Mead
 | year=1934
 | title=Mind, Self, and Society
 | publisher=University of Chicago Press
 | location=Chicago
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mead's main interest was the way in which children learn how to become a part of society by imaginative ''role-taking'', observing and mimicking others. This is always done in an interactive way: it's not meaningful to think of a role for one person alone, only for that person as an individual who is both co-operating and competing with others. Adults behave similarly: taking roles from those that they see around them, adapting them in creative ways, and (by the process of social interaction) testing them and either confirming them or modifying them. This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable [[ambiguity]], but is nevertheless something that is part of all social interactions: each individual actively tries to "define the situation" (understand their role within it); choose a role that is advantageous or appealing; play that role; and persuade others to support the role.

===Social norms theory===
[[Social norms approach|Social norms theory]] states that much of people's behaviour is influenced by their perception of how other members of their [[Ingroups and outgroups|social group]] behave. When individuals are in a state of [[deindividuation]], they see themselves only in terms of group identity, and their behaviour is likely to be guided by group norms alone.
But while group norms have a powerful effect on behaviour, they can only guide behaviour when they are activated by obvious reminders or by subtle cues. People adhere to social norms through enforcement, internalisation, the sharing of norms by other group members, and frequent activation {{Harv|Smith|2007}}. Norms can be enforced through punishment or reward. Individuals are rewarded for living up to their roles (i.e. students getting an "A" on their exam) or punished for not completing the duties of their role (i.e. a salesman is fired for not selling enough product).

Social norm theory has been applied as an environmental approach, with an aim of influencing individuals by manipulating their [[Social environment|social and cultural environments]]. It has been widely applied using [[social marketing]] techniques. Normative messages are designed for delivery using various media and promotional strategies in order to effectively reach a target population. Social norms theory has also been successfully applied through strategies such as curriculum infusion, creating press coverage, policy development, and small group inventions.(Main Frame 2002)

====The theory of planned behaviour====
People display [[reactance (psychology)|reactance]] by fighting against threats to their freedom of action when they find norms inappropriate. [[Propositional attitude|Attitudes]] and norms typically work together to influence behaviour (directly or indirectly). The [[theory of planned behaviour]] intentions are a function of three factors: attitudes about the behaviour, social norms relevant to the behaviour, and perceptions of control over the behaviour. When attitudes and norms disagree, their influence on behaviour will depend on their relative accessibility.

====Team role theory====
As described in ''Working in Groups'' by Engleberg and Wynn, team role theory is when "members assume roles that are compatible with their personal characteristics and skills". [[Meredith Belbin]], a psychologist, first explored the concept of team-role theory in the 1970s when he and his research team went about observing teams and wanted to find out what made teams work and what did not. According to Belbin and his research team "the research revealed that the difference between success and failure for a team was not dependent on factors such as intellect, but more on behavior" (Belbin). They began to identify separate clusters of behaviors and found that behavior was more influential on a team than anything else. These separate clusters of behaviors are known as the "Team Roles".  The nine "team roles" are as follows: coordinator/chairperson, shaper, innovator, resource investigator, monitor/evaluator, implementer, teamworker, completer/finisher, and specialist.

== Role conflict and role confusion ==
{{See also|Role conflict}}

There are situations where the prescribed sets of behaviour that characterise roles may lead to [[cognitive dissonance]] in individuals. Role conflict is a special form of [[social conflict]] that takes place when one is forced to take on two different and incompatible roles at the same time. For example, a person may find conflict between her role as a mother and her role as an employee of a company when her child's demands for time and attention distract her from the needs of her employer.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Leslie and Cynthia Thompson. (2003-05-12) [http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/encyclopedia_entry.php?id=264 Work-Family role conflict] ''Encyclopedia.'' Sloan Family Work and Research Network, Boston College. Retrieved 2008-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, role confusion occurs in a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he or she should play, but where the roles are not necessarily incompatible. For example, if a college student attending a social function encounters his teacher as a fellow guest, he will have to determine whether to relate to the teacher as a student or a peer.

== Role enhancement ==
Role enhancement or ''role enrichment'' refers to a situation in which roles which are held by a person are compatible and moreover enacting one role has beneficial [[spillover effect]]s on the enactment of the other role. An example which has been studied in depth is the enhancement among roles of ''breadwinner'' and ''caretaker'' ([[work–family enrichment]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Greenhaus, Gary N. Powell, [http://aomarticles.metapress.com/content/959878ur98n7aap6/ ''When Work and Family are Allies: A Theory of Work-Family Enrichment''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120726090616/http://aomarticles.metapress.com/content/959878ur98n7aap6/ |date=2012-07-26 }}, The Academy of Management Review, Vol. 31, No. 1, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence indicates that role conflict and role enhancement can occur simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beth Tiedje | first1 = Linda | last2 = Wortman | first2 = Camille B. | last3 = Downey | first3 = Geraldine | last4 = Emmons | first4 = Carol | last5 = Biernat | first5 = Monica | last6 = Lang | first6 = Eric | year = 1990 | title = Women with Multiple Roles: Role-Compatibility Perceptions, Satisfaction, and Mental Health | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 63| jstor=352838 | doi=10.2307/352838}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further evidence suggests that [[mental health]] correlates with low role conflict and high role enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grzywacz | first1 = Joseph G. | last2 = Bass | first2 = Brenda L. | year = 2003 | title = Work, Family, and Mental Health: Testing Different Models of Work–Family Fit | url = http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/155.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 248–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00248.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/encyclopedia_entry.php?id=264 ''Work-Family Role Conflict''], 2003, [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan Work and Family Research Network]] Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Also certain [[personality trait]]s, in particular traits linked to perceiving and seeking greater levels of support, are associated with lower inter-role conflict and increase inter-role enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friede Westring | first1 = Alyssa | last2 = Marie Ryan | first2 = Ann | year = 2010 | title = Personality and inter-role conflict and enrichment: Investigating the mediating role of support | url = http://hum.sagepub.com/content/63/12/1815.short | journal = Human Relations | volume = 63 | issue = 12| pages = 1815–1834 | doi = 10.1177/0018726710371236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documenting roles ==
In business, documenting roles on [[process model]]s, such as [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN diagrams]] as [[swim lane]]s, is becoming common practice in large companies (50% of European and North American companies reported a "significant" or "strategic" commitment&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Paul and Wolf, Celia [http://www.bptrends.com/members_surveys/deliver.cfm?report_id=1003&amp;target=BPTrends%202008%20Survey%20Report%202-11-08%20Final,%20V_2_.pdf&amp;return=surveys_landing.cfm ''The State of Business Process Management: 2008''], Business Process Trends, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). This documentation helps organisations undertaking change projects to formally define the current or envisioned (future) roles expected to be responsible for a business process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">Given a coupled DEVS model, simulation algorithms are methods to generate the model's ''legal'' behaviors, which are a set of trajectories not to reach illegal states. (see [[Behavior of Coupled DEVS|behavior of a Coupled DEVS]] model.)  [[Simulation_Algorithms_for_Coupled_DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]] originally introduced the algorithms that handle time variables related to ''lifespan'' &lt;math&gt;t_s \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; and ''elapsed time'' &lt;math&gt;t_e\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; by introducing two other time variables, ''last event time'', &lt;math&gt;t_l\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''next event time'' &lt;math&gt; t_n\in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; with the following relations: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \, t_e = t - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_s = t_n - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''current time''. And the ''remaining time'',

 &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\,t_r=t_s-t_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; is equivalently computed as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_r = t_n - t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;, apparently &lt;math&gt; t_r \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.
Based on these relationships, the algorithms to simulate the behavior of a given Coupled DEVS are written as follows.

People may not only share emotions with others, but may also experience similar physiological arousal to others if they feel a sense of social connectedness to the other person. A laboratory-based study by Cwir, Car, Walton, and Spencer (2011) showed that, when a participant felt a sense of social connectedness to a stranger (research confederate), the participant experienced similar emotional states and physiological responses to that of the stranger while observing the stranger perform a stressful task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cwir|first=D.|author2=Carr, P.

==Behavioral neuroscience==
After [[functional imaging]]—[[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) in particular—became popular roughly a decade ago, researchers have begun to study economic decision-making with this new technology. This allows researchers to investigate, on a neurological level, the role emotions play in decision-making.

===Developmental picture===
The ability to describe situations in which a social emotion will be experienced emerges at around age 7,&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; and, by adolescence, the experience of social emotion permeates everyday [[social exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind|first=David|author2=Bowen, Robert |title=Imaginary audience behavior in children and adolescents.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1 January 1979|volume=15|issue=1|pages=38–44|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.1.38|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/15/1/38/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using fMRI have found that different brain regions are involved in different age groups when performing social-cognitive and social-emotional tasks. While brain areas such as [[Medial prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)]], [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus (STS)]], [[Temporal pole|temporal poles (TP)]] and [[precuneus]] bordering with [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate cortex]] are activated in both adults and adolescents when they reason about intentionality of others, the medial PFC is more activated in adolescents and the right STS more in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blakemore|first=S.-J. |author2=den Ouden, H. |author3=Choudhury, S. |author4=Frith, C. |title=Adolescent development of the neural circuitry for thinking about intentions|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=1 June 2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=130–139|doi=10.1093/scan/nsm009|url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/130.full.pdf+html|pmc=1948845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar age effects were found with younger participants, such that, when participants perform tasks that involve [[theory of mind]], increase in age is correlated with an increase in activation in the dorsal part of the MPFC and a decrease in the activity in the ventral part of the MPFC were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MORIGUCHI|first=YOSHIYA |author2=OHNISHI, TAKASHI |author3=MORI, TAKEYUKI |author4=MATSUDA, HIROSHI |author5=KOMAKI, GEN|title=Changes of brain activity in the neural substrates for theory of mind during childhood and adolescence|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=1 August 2007|volume=61|issue=4|pages=355–363|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01687.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01687.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that compare adults with adolescents in their processings of basic and social emotions also suggest developmental shifts in brain areas being involved. Comparing with adolescents, the left [[temporal pole]] has a stronger activity in adults when they read stories that elicit social emotions.&lt;ref name=Burnett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burnett|first=S|author2=Bird, G |author3=Moll, J |author4=Frith, C |author5=Blakemore, SJ |title=Development during adolescence of the neural processing of social emotion.|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=September 2009|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1736–50|pmid=18823226|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal poles are thought to store abstract social knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frith|first=C.

To investigate the function of social emotions in economic behaviors, researchers are interested in the differences in brain regions involved when participants are playing with, or think that they are playing with, another person as opposed to a computer. A study with fMRI found that, for participants who tend to cooperate on two-person “trust and reciprocity” games, believing that they are playing with another participant activated the [[prefrontal cortex]], while believing that they are playing with a computer did not.&lt;ref name=McCabe/&gt; This difference was not seen with players who tend not to cooperate.&lt;ref name=McCabe&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCabe|first=K.|title=A functional imaging study of cooperation in two-person reciprocal exchange|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=98|issue=20|pages=11832–11835|doi=10.1073/pnas.211415698|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/20/11832.long|pmid=11562505|pmc=58817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors interpret this difference as theory of minds that cooperators employ to anticipate the opponents' strategies. This is an example of the way social decision making differs from other forms of decision making.

In [[behavioral economics]], a heavy criticism is that people do not always act in a fully rational way, as many [[economic model]]s assume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=The American Economic Review|date=Dec 2003|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1449–1475|jstor=3132137|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel |author2=Jack L. Knetsch |author3=Richard H. Thaler|title=Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Winter 1991|volume=5|issue=1|pages=193–206|jstor=1942711|doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|title=Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=Nov 1961|volume=75|issue=4|pages=643–669|jstor=1884324|doi=10.2307/1884324}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[ultimatum game]], two players are asked to divide a certain amount of money, say ''x''. One player, called the ''proposer'', decides ratio by which the money gets divided. The other player, called the ''responder'', decides whether or not to accept this offer. If the responder accepts the offer, say, ''y'' amount of money, then the proposer gets ''x-y'' amount and the responder gets ''y''. But if the responder refuses to accept the offer, both players get nothing. This game is widely studied in behavioral economics. According to the [[rational agent]] model, the most rational way for the proposer to act is to make ''y'' as small as possible, and the most rational way for the responder to act is to accept the offer, since little amount of money is better than no money. However, what these experiments tend to find is that the proposers tend to offer 40% of ''x'', and offers below 20% would get rejected by the responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camerer|first=Colin F.|title=Behavioral game theory experiments in strategic interaction|year=2003|publisher=Russell Sage [u.a.]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-691-09039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using fMRI scans, researchers found that social emotions elicited by the offers may play a role in explaining the result. When offers are unfair as opposed to fair, three regions of the brain are active: the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)]], the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)]], and the [[insular cortex|insula]]. The insula is an area active in registering body discomfort.
It is activated when people feel, among other things, social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=N. I.|title=Does Rejection Hurt? An fMRI Study of Social Exclusion|journal=Science|date=10 October 2003|volume=302|issue=5643|pages=290–292|doi=10.1126/science.1089134|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5643/290.short|pmid=14551436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors interpret activity in the insula as the aversive reaction one feels when faced with unfairness, activity in the DLPFC as processing the future reward from keeping the money, and the ACC is an arbiter that weighs these two conflicting inputs to make a decision. Whether or not the offer gets rejected can be predicted (with a correlation of 0.45) by the level of the responder's insula activity.&lt;ref name=Stanfey/&gt;

Neuroeconomics and social emotions are also tightly linked in the study of punishment. Research using [[PET scan|PET]] scan has found that, when players punish other players, activity in the [[nucleus accumbens]] (part of the [[striatum]]), a region known for processing rewards derived from actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Doherty|first=J.|title=Dissociable Roles of Ventral and Dorsal Striatum in Instrumental Conditioning|journal=Science|date=16 April 2004|volume=304|issue=5669|pages=452–454|doi=10.1126/science.1094285|pmid=15087550}}&lt;/ref&gt; gets activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Quervain|first=D. J.-F.|title=The Neural Basis of Altruistic Punishment|journal=Science|date=27 August 2004|volume=305|issue=5688|pages=1254–1258|doi=10.1126/science.1100735|bibcode=2004Sci...305.1254D}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows that we not only feel hurtful when we become victims of unfairness, but we also find it psychologically rewarding to punish the wrongdoer, even at a cost to our own utility.

==Social or moral aspect==
Some social emotions are also referred to as moral emotions because of the fundamental role they play in morality.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt; For example, guilt is the discomfort and regret one feels over one's wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson TJ, Stegge H. 1998. Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic&lt;/ref&gt; It is a social emotion, because it requires the perception that another person is being hurt by this act; and it also has implication in morality, such that the guilty actor, in virtue of feeling distressed and guilty, accepts responsibility for the wrongdoing, which might cause desire to make amends or punish the self.&lt;ref name=Tangney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June P.|title=Moral affect: The good, the bad, and the ugly.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1991|volume=61|issue=4|pages=598–607|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.4.598|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/61/4/598/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social emotions are moral emotions. Pride, for instance, is a social emotion which involves the perceived admiration of other people, but research on the role it plays in moral behaviors yields problematic results.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt;

===Empathic response===
[[Empathy]] is defined by Eisenberg and colleagues as an affective response that stems from the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state or condition and is similar to what the other person is feeling or would be expected to feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Fabes, Richard A. |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Karbon, Mariss |display-authors=etal |title=The relations of emotionality and regulation to dispositional and situational empathy-related responding.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1994|volume=66|issue=4|pages=776–797|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt, which is a social emotion with strong moral implication, is also strongly correlated with empathic responsiveness; whereas shame, an emotion with less moral flavor, is negatively correlated with empathic responsiveness, when controlling for guilt.&lt;ref name=Tangney/&gt;

Perceived controllability also plays an important role modulating people's socio-emotional reactions and empathic responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|title=Social motivation, justice, and the moral emotions : an attributional approach|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-5526-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, participants who are asked to evaluate other people's academic performances are more likely to assign punishments when the low performance is interpreted as low-effort, as opposed to low-ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1985|volume=92|issue=4|pages=548–573|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.4.548|pmid=3903815}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social stigma|Stigmas]] also elicit more empathic response when they are perceived as uncontrollable (i.e., having a biological origin, such as having certain disease), as opposed to controllable (i.e. having a behavioral origin, such as obesity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|author2=Perry, Raymond P. |author3=Magnusson, Jamie |title=An attributional analysis of reactions to stigmas.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=55|issue=5|pages=738–748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.5.738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick Leighton - Solitude.jpg|thumb|upright|''Solitude'' by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic Leighton]]]]

'''Solitude''' is a state of [[seclusion]] or isolation, i.e., lack of contact with people.  It may stem from bad relationships, loss of loved ones, deliberate choice, [[infectious disease]], [[mental disorder]]s, [[Circadian rhythm sleep disorder|neurological disorder]]s or circumstances of employment or situation (see [[castaway]]).

Short-term solitude is often valued as a time when one may work, think or rest without being disturbed. It may be desired for the sake of [[privacy]].

A distinction has been made between solitude and [[loneliness]]. In this sense, these two words refer, respectively, to the joy and the pain of being alone.&lt;ref&gt;"Our language has wisely sensed the two sides of being alone. It has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone."  [[Paul Tillich]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Alexander Pope]] |title=Ode on Solitude |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/ode-on-solitude/ |accessdate=2016-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421125715/http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/ode-on-solitude |archivedate=2016-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singlescafe.net/solitude.html |title=The Difference Between Solitude and Loneliness |publisher=Singlescafe.net |accessdate=2013-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215035154/http://www.singlescafe.net/solitude.html |archivedate=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cym |url=http://effortlessflow.blogspot.it/2011/03/difference-between-solitude-and.html |title=Effortless Flow: The Difference Between Solitude and Loneliness |publisher=Effortlessflow.blogspot.it |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2013-03-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826041537/http://effortlessflow.blogspot.it/2011/03/difference-between-solitude-and.html |archivedate=2013-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
Symptoms from complete isolation, called [[sensory deprivation]], often include [[anxiety]], sensory [[illusion]]s, or even distortions of [[time]] and perception. However, this is the case when there is no stimulation of the [[sensory systems]] at all, and not only lack of contact with people. Thus, by having other things to keep one's mind busy, this is avoided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/archives/august/wed25082004/executives/upfront/upfront02.htm ]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322131526/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/august/wed25082004/executives/upfront/upfront02.htm |date=March 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, long-term solitude is often seen as undesirable, causing [[loneliness]] or [[recluse|reclusion]] resulting from inability to establish [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. Furthermore, it might even lead to [[clinical depression]]. However, for some people, solitude is not depressing. Still others (e.g. [[monk]]s) regard long-term solitude as a means of spiritual [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. Indeed, [[marooning|marooned]] people have been left in solitude for years without any report of psychological symptoms afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Enforced loneliness (solitary confinement) has been a punishment method throughout history. It is often considered a form of torture.
In contrast, some psychological conditions (such as [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Maltsberger, J.T., M. Pompili and R. Tatarelli |title=Sandro Morselli: Schizophrenic Solitude, Suicide, and Psychotherapy |journal=Suicide &amp; Life Threatening Behavior |volume= 36|issue=5 |pages=591–600 |year=2006 |pmid=17087638 |doi=10.1521/suli.2006.36.5.591 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[schizoid personality disorder]]) are strongly linked to a tendency to seek solitude. In [[Pit of Despair|animal experiments]], solitude has been shown to cause [[psychosis]].{{Dubious | reason=evidence unlikely to support claim | date= January 2017}}

[[Emotional isolation]] is a state of isolation where one has a well-functioning [[social network]] but still feels emotionally separated from others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the last few years, however, researchers like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work ''The Handbook of Solitude'', the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coplan, Robert J.|first1=Bowker, Julie C.|title=A Handbook of Solitude: Psychological Perspectives on Social Isolation|date=2013|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite a variety of other faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude is more than just a personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=The Role of Solitude in Transcending Social Crises--New Possibilities for Existential Sociology.|date=2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=499–516}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.

==Psychological effects==
[[File:חסיד מתבודד.jpg|thumb|left|[[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslover]] [[Hasid]] practicing [[hitbodedut]].]]
There are both positive and negative psychological effects of solitude. Much of the time, these effects and the longevity is determined by the amount of time a person spends in [[Solitary confinement|isolation]].&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplink.com.au/lawlibrary/Documents/Docs/Doc82.html |author=Bartol, C.R., &amp; Bartol, A.M. |year=1994 |title=Psychology and Law: Research and Application (2nd ed.) |publisher=Pacific Grove |location=CA: Brooks/Cole. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130075821/http://www.uplink.com.au/lawlibrary/Documents/Docs/Doc82.html |archivedate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects can range anywhere from more [[free will|freedom]] to increased [[spirituality]],&lt;ref name="second"&gt;Long, Christopher R. and Averill, James R. “Solitude: An Exploration of the Benefits of Being Alone.”  Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 33:1 (2003): Web. 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; while the negative effects are socially depriving and may trigger the onset of [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="third"&gt;Kupers, Terry A. “What To Do With the Survivors? Coping With the Long-Term Effects of Isolated Confinement”. Criminal Justice and Behavior 35.8 (2008): Web. 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While positive solitude is often desired, negative solitude is often involuntary or undesired at the time it occurs.&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Long |first1=Christopher R. |first2=Mary |last2=Seburn |first3=James R. |last3=Averill |first4=Thomas A. |last4=More |title=Solitude Experiences: Varieties, Settings, and Individual Differences |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/ |publisher=Sage Publications |date=5 September 2002 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204075502/http://psp.sagepub.com/ |archivedate=4 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive effects===
There are many benefits to spending time alone. Freedom is considered to be one of the benefits of solitude; the constraints of others will not have any effect on a person who is spending time in solitude, therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions. With increased freedom, a person’s choices are less likely to be affected by exchanges with others.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

A person's [[creativity]] can be sparked when given freedom. Solitude can increase freedom and moreover, freedom from distractions has the potential to spark creativity. In 1994, psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] found that adolescents who cannot bear to be alone often stop enhancing creative talents.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

Another proven benefit to time given in solitude is the development of self. When a person spends time in solitude from others, they may experience changes to their self-concept. This can also help a person to form or discover their identity without any outside distractions. Solitude also provides time for contemplation, growth in personal spirituality, and self-examination. In these situations, loneliness can be avoided as long as the person in solitude knows that they have meaningful relations with others.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

===Negative effects===
Too much solitude is not always considered beneficial. Many of the negative effects have been observed in prisoners. Often, prisoners spend extensive time in solitude, where their behavior may worsen.&lt;ref name="third"/&gt; Solitude can trigger physiological responses that increase health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2015/11/loneliness-triggers-cellular-changes-that-can-cause-illness-study-shows-39407|title=Loneliness triggers cellular changes that can cause illness, study shows|website=PsyPost|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601175404/http://www.psypost.org/2015/11/loneliness-triggers-cellular-changes-that-can-cause-illness-study-shows-39407|archivedate=2016-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative effects of solitude may also depend on age. Elementary age school children who experience frequent solitude may react negatively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=R. W.|date=1997-02-01|title=The emergence of solitude as a constructive domain of experience in early adolescence|journal=Child Development|volume=68|issue=1|pages=80–93|issn=0009-3920|pmid=9084127|doi=10.2307/1131927}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely because, often, solitude at this age is not something chosen by the child. Solitude in elementary-age children may occur when they are unsure of how to interact socially with others so they prefer to be alone, causing shyness or social rejection.

While teenagers are more likely to feel lonely or unhappy when not around others, they are also more likely to have a more enjoyable experience with others if they have had time alone first. However, teenagers who frequently spend time alone do not have as good a global adjustment as those who balance their time of solitude with their social time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Other uses==

===As pleasure===
[[File:Pyle pirate marooned.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Howard Pyle]]'s 19th century illustration of a [[Marooning|marooned]] [[pirate]].]]

Solitude does not necessarily entail feelings of loneliness, and in fact may, for those who choose it with deliberate intent, be one's sole source of genuine pleasure. For example, in religious contexts, some saints preferred silence and found immense pleasure in their perceived uniformity with God. Solitude is a state that can be positively modified utilizing it for [[prayer]] allowing to "be alone with ourselves and with God, to put ourselves in listening to his will, but also of what moves in our hearts, let purify our relationships; solitude and silence thus become spaces inhabited by God, and ability to recover ourselves and grow in humanity. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bibbiafrancescana.org/2015/02/preghiera-solitudine-e-silenzio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617135033/http://bibbiafrancescana.org/2015/02/preghiera-solitudine-e-silenzio/ |archivedate=2017-06-17 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Buddha attained enlightenment through uses of meditation, deprived of sensory input, bodily necessities, and external desires, including social interaction. The context of solitude is attainment of pleasure from within, but this does not necessitate complete detachment from the external world.
[[File:Jacques Bodin, De dos XXXXV, oil on canvas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Solitude and the Sea'', a theme by Jacques Bodin]]
This is well demonstrated in the writings of [[Edward Abbey]] with particular regard to ''[[Desert Solitaire]]'' where solitude focused only on isolation from other people allows for a more complete connection to the external world, as in the absence of human interaction the natural world itself takes on the role of the companion.  In this context, the individual seeking solitude does so not strictly for personal gain or introspection, though this is often an unavoidable outcome, but instead in an attempt to gain an understanding of the natural world as entirely removed from the human perspective as possible, a state of mind much more readily attained in the complete absence of outside human presence. In psychology, introverted individuals may require spending time away from people to recharge. Those who are simply socially apathetic might find it a pleasurable environment in which to occupy oneself with solitary tasks.

===As punishment===
Isolation in the form of [[solitary confinement]] is a punishment or precaution used in many countries throughout the world for prisoners accused of serious crimes, those who may be at risk in the prison population, those who may commit suicide, or those unable to participate in the prison population due to sickness or injury. Research has found that solitary confinement does not deter inmates from committing further violence in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150331131334.htm|title=Criminologist challenges effectiveness of solitary confinement|website=www.sciencedaily.com|access-date=2016-04-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603015205/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150331131334.htm|archivedate=2016-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As treatment===
[[Psychiatric institution]]s may institute full or partial isolation for certain patients, particularly the violent or subversive, in order to address their particular needs and to protect the rest of the recovering population from their influence.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A. Bernstein|author2=Eric Newcomer|title=Principles of Transaction Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmHgK5KKrQQC&amp;pg=PA263|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-094841-6|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has 3 timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: ls -lu),
time of last modification (mtime: ls -l), and
time of last status change (ctime: ls -lc).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:
* Tue 01-01-2009 6:00
* 2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
* 2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]]
* Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005
* 1256953732 ([[Unix time]])
* (1969-07-21 T 02:56 UTC){{snd}} 
* 07:38, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
* 1985-102 T 10:15 UTC ''(day 102 of year 1985 = 12 April 1985)''
* 1985-W15-5 T 10:15 UTC ''(day 5 of week 15 of year 1985 = 12 April 1985)''
* 20180203073000 (02/03/2018 7:30:00)

==Standardization==
[[ISO 8601]] standardizes the representation of dates and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf

|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|quote=3.5 Expansion … By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, it is permitted to expand the component identifying the calendar year, which is otherwise limited to four digits. This enables reference to dates and times in calendar years outside the range supported by complete representations, i.e. before the start of the year [0000] or after the end of the year [9999].}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standard representations are often used to construct timestamp values.

==Other meanings==
'''Timestamp''' can also refer to:

* A [[time code]] (in networking or video technology)
* [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970
* [[ICMP Timestamp]]
* A [[Trusted timestamping|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer [[wikt:vouch|vouches]] for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part of the [[digital signature]]
* The modification or access [[system time|time]] of a [[computer file|file]] or [[directory (file systems)|directory]] in a computer [[file system]] or [[database]]
* A proof of authenticity of a person (if a picture is timestamped it asserts the image is original) on sites such as [[4chan]]
