'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Access to information, just as [[media independence]] and pluralism remain critical issues in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/moldova-stakeholder-submission-universal-periodic-review |title=Moldova: stakeholder Submission for the Universal Periodic Review |last= |first= |date=28 March 2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher= Freedom House|access-date=23 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=Jurnal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jurnal.md/en/politic/2016/10/14/access-to-information-more-and-more-difficult-in-moldova-things-that-are-in-fact-of-public-interest-are-excessively-and-abusively-kept-secret/  |title=Access to information, more and more difficult in Moldova; “Things that  are, in fact, of public interest are excessively and abusively kept secret” |last= |first= |date=14 October 2016 |website=Jurnal.md |publisher=Jurnal online |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; In 2014, the [[Independent Journalism Center (IJC)]] presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide additional guarantees for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law has not yet been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title= Report on the State of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url= http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher= Eastern Partnership. Civil Society Forum |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Executive Director of the [[Association of Independent Press]], Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.&lt;ref name=Jurnal/&gt;

==Legal framework==

The right to access public information in guaranteed by Article 34 of the Moldovan Constitution and is regulated by the Law on Access to Information which was adopted in 2000.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rti-rating.org/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/files/pdf/Moldova.pdf Republic of Moldova. The Law on Access Information. Retrieved 23 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The law establishes that information of public interest can be requested in writing or orally. Information can be consulted at the institution’s premises or can be received stored in an electronic support or in hardcopy.  Viewing documents on the institution’s premises is free of charge, while reasonable fees can be charged for the cost of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url= http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher= Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law, documents of public interest must be provided within 15 working days, which can be extended by five days in case of requests of large numbers of documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; If the request is rejected, the applicant can exercise its right of appeal to the relevant courts, and if the court decides on behalf of the applicant, the law imposes penalties in form of fines to the government body which has violated the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Exceptions justifying limitation to the disclosure regime are specified in the law and include state secrets, information on the military, intelligence, economic, foreign policy or criminal proceedings, information concerning ongoing lawsuit, personal data, confidential business data, and preliminary results of scientific and technical research.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

In practice, compliance with the Law on Access to Information remains weak just as its implementation which is not supported by the full authority of the bodies responsible for its enforcement. The [[Ombudsman]] in Moldova has the authority to supervise the implementation of the law, but this office lacks the capacity and the resources to exercise its role.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society organisations face numerous difficulties when requesting access to public information, including obstruction by public officials, refusals and delays in replying to requests, as well as incomplete responses to requests for information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; To justify their denials, public officials frequently cite laws that conflict with the Law on Access to Information, in particular the Law on State Secrets and the Law on Trade Secrets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

One of the problem in enforcing the right to access public information is impunity, meaning that the law establishes only insignificant fines on public offices who fail to provide due access to information. Also, in many cases, the information provided by state bodies is shaped in the officials' favor, giving the impression that authorities are behaving in compliance with the law, while in fact depriving the requester the information they are seeking. Moreover, in many cases officials do not provide public interest information without the approval from a supervisor and often refuse to answers telephone calls from journalists, thus increasing the time for getting the required information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Another problem concerns the costs for obtaining public information and the fees charged to the requester, despite some improvements made recently, such as the introduction of a public register through the [[E-government|E-Government]] service in 2014. This affects in particular newsrooms and investigative journalists that must pay large sums of money for getting data useful for their investigative work.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

'''Arousal''' is the [[physiology|physiological]] and [[psychology|psychological]] state of being awoken or of [[Five senses|sense]] organs stimulated to a point of perception. It involves activation of the [[ascending reticular activating system]] (ARAS) in the [[human brain|brain]], which mediates wakefulness, the [[autonomic nervous system]], and the [[endocrine system]], leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure and a condition of sensory alertness, mobility, and readiness to respond.

Arousal is mediated by several different neural systems. Wakefulness is regulated by the ARAS, which is composed of projections from five major neurotransmitter systems that originate in the [[brainstem]] and form connections extending throughout the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]; activity within the ARAS is regulated by neurons that release the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[serotonin]]. Activation of these neurons produces an increase in cortical activity and subsequently alertness.

Arousal is important in regulating [[consciousness]], [[attention]], [[alertness]], and [[information processing]]. It is crucial for [[motivation|motivating]] certain behaviours, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the [[fight-or-flight response]] and [[sexual behaviour|sexual activity]] (the arousal phase of [[Masters and Johnson]]'s [[human sexual response cycle]]). It is also important in [[emotion]] and has been included in theories such as the [[James-Lange theory of emotion]]. According to [[Hans Eysenck]], differences in baseline arousal level lead people to be [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverts or introverts]].

The [[Yerkes-Dodson law]] states that an optimal level of arousal for performance exists, and too little or too much arousal can adversely affect task performance. One interpretation of the Yerkes-Dodson Law is the Easterbrook cue-utilisation hypothesis. Easterbrook states that an increase of arousal decreases the number of cues that can be used.

Wakefulness is regulated by the [[ascending reticular activating system]], which is composed of five major [[neurotransmitter system]]s – the [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[serotonin]] systems – that originate in the [[brainstem]] and form connections which extend throughout the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="ARAS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwańczuk W, Guźniczak P | title = Neurophysiological foundations of sleep, arousal, awareness and consciousness phenomena. Part 1 | journal = Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–167 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25940332 | doi = 10.5603/AIT.2015.0015 | quote = The ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) is responsible for a sustained wakefulness state. It receives information from sensory receptors of various modalities, transmitted through spinoreticular pathways and cranial nerves (trigeminal nerve — polymodal pathways, olfactory nerve, optic nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve — monomodal pathways). These pathways reach the thalamus directly or indirectly via the medial column of reticular formation nuclei (magnocellular nuclei and reticular nuclei of pontine tegmentum). The reticular activating system begins in the dorsal part of the posterior midbrain and anterior pons, continues into the diencephalon, and then divides into two parts reaching the thalamus and hypothalamus, which then project into the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1). The thalamic projection is dominated by cholinergic neurons originating from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus of pons and midbrain (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus of pons and midbrain (LDT) nuclei [17, 18]. The hypothalamic projection involves noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) and serotoninergic neurons of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DR), which pass through the lateral hypothalamus and reach axons of the histaminergic tubero-mamillary nucleus (TMN), together forming a pathway extending into the forebrain, cortex and hippocampus. Cortical arousal also takes advantage of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), ventral tegmenti area (VTA) and the periaqueductal grey area (PAG). Fewer cholinergic neurons of the pons and midbrain send projections to the forebrain along the ventral pathway, bypassing the thalamus [19, 20].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM - ascending reticular activating system"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York, USA | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 295 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 12: Sleep and Arousal | quote = The ARAS is a complex structure consisting of several different circuits including the four monoaminergic pathways&amp;nbsp;... The norepinephrine pathway originates from the locus ceruleus (LC) and related brainstem nuclei; the serotonergic neurons originate from the raphe nuclei within the brainstem as well; the dopaminergic neurons originate in ventral tegmental area (VTA); and the histaminergic pathway originates from neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) of the posterior hypothalamus. As discussed in Chapter 6, these neurons project widely throughout the brain from restricted collections of cell bodies. Norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and histamine have complex modulatory functions and, in general, promote wakefulness. The PT in the brain stem is also an important component of the ARAS. Activity of PT cholinergic neurons (REM-on cells) promotes REM sleep. During waking, REM-on cells are inhibited by a subset of ARAS norepinephrine and serotonin neurons called REM-off cells.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfaff"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfaff|first1=Donald|title=Brain arousal and information theory neural and genetic mechanisms|date=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674042100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V0E5Smkq7u8C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When stimulated, these systems produce cortical activity and alertness.&lt;ref name="ARAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM - ascending reticular activating system" /&gt;

The noradrenergic system is a bundle of axons that originate in the [[locus coeruleus]] and ascends up into the neocortex, [[limbic system]], and basal forebrain. Most of the neurons are projected to the posterior cortex which is important with sensory information, and alertness. The activation of the locus coeruleus and release of norepinephrine causes wakefulness and increases vigilance. The neurons that project into the basal forebrain impact cholinergic neurons that results in a flood of acetylcholine into the cerebral cortex.

The acetylcholinergic system has its neurons located in the pons and in the basal forebrain. Stimulation of these neurons result in cortical activity, shown from EEG records, and alertness. All of the other four neurotransmitters play a role in activating the acetylcholine neurons.

Another arousal system, the dopaminergic system, releases dopamine produced by the [[substantia nigra]]. The neurons arise in the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain, and projects to the nucleus accumbens, the striatum forebrain, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex. The limbic system is important for control of mood, and the nucleus accumbens signal excitement and arousal. The path terminating in the prefrontal cortex is important in regulating motor movements, especially reward oriented movements.

The serotonergic system has almost all of its serotonergic neurons originating in the [[raphe nuclei]]. This system projects to the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex. Stimulation of these axons and release of serotonin causes cortical arousal and impacts locomotion and mood.

The neurons of the histamergenic system are in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. These neurons send pathways to the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and the basal forebrain, where they stimulate the release of acetylcholine into the cerebral cortex.

All of these systems are linked and show similar redundancy. The pathways described are ascending pathways, but there also arousal pathways that descend. One example is the ventrolateral preoptic area, which release [[GABA reuptake inhibitor]]s, which interrupt wakefulness and arousal. Neurotransmitters of the arousal system, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, work to inhibit the ventrolateral preoptic area.

Arousal is important in regulating [[consciousness]], attention, and information processing.  It is crucial for [[motivation|motivating]] certain behaviors, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the [[fight-or-flight response]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] (see [[Masters and Johnson]]'s [[human sexual response cycle]], where it is known as the ''arousal phase''). Arousal is also an essential element in many influential theories of [[emotion]], such as the [[James-Lange theory of emotion]] or the [[Emotion classification#Circumplex model|Circumplex Model]].  According to [[Hans Eysenck]], differences in baseline arousal level lead people to be either [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverts or introverts]]. Later research suggests that extroverts and introverts likely have different ''arousability''. Their baseline arousal level is the same, but the response to stimulation is different.&lt;ref&gt;Randy J. Larsen, David M Buss; "Personality psychology, domains of knowledge about human nature", McGraw Hill, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yerkes–Dodson law]] states that there is a relationship between arousal and task performance, essentially arguing that there is an optimal level of arousal for performance, and too little or too much arousal can adversely affect task performance. One interpretation of the Yerkes–Dodson law is the Easterbrook cue-utilisation theory. It predicted that high levels of arousal will lead to [[attention]] narrowing, during which the range of [[Sensory cue|cues]] from the stimulus and the environment decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=J. A.|title=The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior|journal=Psychological Review|date=1959|volume=66|issue=3|pages=183–201|doi=10.1037/h0047707|pmid=13658305}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, attention will be focused primarily on the arousing details (cues) of the stimulus, so that information central to the source of the emotional arousal will be encoded while peripheral details will not.&lt;ref name="sharot2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharot | first1 = T | last2 = Phelps | first2 = E A | year = 2004 | title = How arousal modulates memory: Disentangling the effects of attention and retention | url = | journal = Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 294–306 | doi = 10.3758/CABN.4.3.294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[positive psychology]], arousal is described as a response to a difficult challenge for which the subject has moderate skills.&lt;ref name="Finding Flow"/&gt;

== Personality ==

=== Introversion and extroversion ===

Eysenck's theory of arousal describes the different natural frequency or arousal states of the brains of people who are introverted versus people who are extroverted. The theory states that the brains of extroverts are naturally less stimulated, so these types have a predisposition to seek out situations and partake in behaviors that will stimulate arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biological Basis of Personality|last=Eysenck|first=H. J.|publisher=Charles C Thomas|year=1967|isbn=|location=Springfield, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas extroverts are naturally under-stimulated and therefore actively engage in arousing situations, introverts are naturally over-stimulated and therefore avoid intense arousal. Campbell and Hawley (1982) studied the differences in introverts versus extroverts responses to particular work environments in the library.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belojevic|first1=G|date=June 2001|title=Mental performance in noise: The role of introversion|url=|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=209-213|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0188|via=www.idealibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that introverts were more likely to choose quiet areas with minimal to no noise or people. Extroverts were more likely to choose areas with much activity with more noise and people.&lt;ref name=First /&gt; Daoussiss and McKelvie's (1986) research showed that introverts performed worse on memory tasks when they were in the presence of music compared to silence. Extroverts were less affected by the presence of music.&lt;ref name=First /&gt; Similarly, Belojevic, Slepcevic and Jokovljevic (2001) found that introverts had more concentration problems and fatigue in their mental processing when work was coupled with external noise or distracting factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belojevic|first=G.|last2=Slepcevic|first2=V.|last3=Jakovljevic|first3=B.|date=June 2001|title=Mental performance in noise: The role of introversion|url=|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=209-213|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0188|via=www.idealibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of arousal surrounding the individuals greatly affected their ability to perform tasks and behaviors, with the introverts being more affected than the extroverts, because of each's naturally high and low levels of stimulation, respectively.

=== Emotional stability vs. introversion-extraversion ===

[[Neuroticism]] or emotional instability and extroversion are two factors of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Personality Index]]. These two dimensions of personality describe how a person deals with anxiety-provoking or emotional stimuli as well as how a person behaves and responds to relevant and irrelevant external stimuli in their environment. Neurotics experience tense arousal which is characterized by tension and nervousness. Extroverts experience high energetic arousal which is characterized by vigor and energy.&lt;ref name="Third"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zajenkowski|first1=Marcin|last2=Goryńska|first2=Ewa|last3=Winiewski|first3=Mikołaj|title=Variability of the relationship between personality and mood|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=May 2012|volume=52|issue=7|pages=858–861|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray (1981) claimed that extroverts have a higher sensitivity to reward signals than to punishment in comparison to introverts. Reward signals aim to raise the energy levels.&lt;ref name=Third /&gt; Therefore, extroverts typically have a higher energetic arousal because of their greater response to rewards.

=== Four personality types ===

[[Hippocrates]] theorized that there are four personality types: [[choleric]], [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[Four Temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]], and [[phlegmatic]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EysenckPersonalityTypes.gif|thumbnail|right|Eysenck's 4 Personality Types]] --&gt;
Put in terms of the five factor level of personality, choleric people are high in neuroticism and high in extraversion. The choleric react immediately, and the arousal is strong, lasting, and can easily create new excitement about similar situations, ideas, or impressions.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt; Melancholic people are high in neuroticism and low in extraversion (or more introverted). The melancholic are slow to react and it takes time for an impression to be made upon them if any is made at all. However, when aroused by something, melancholics have a deeper and longer lasting reaction, especially when exposed to similar experiences.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt; Sanguine people are low in neuroticism (or more emotionally stable) and high in extraversion. The sanguine are quickly aroused and excited, like the cholerics, but unlike the cholerics, their arousal is shallow, superficial, and shortly leaves them as quickly as it developed.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hock|first=Conrad|title=The Four Temperaments|year=1934|publisher=Catholic Apostolate Press|location=Milwaukee, WI|isbn=978-1453823941|url=http://sedevacantist.com/misc/temperaments.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phlegmatic people are low in neuroticism and low in extraversion. The phlegmatic are slower to react and the arousal is fleeting.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt;

The contrasts in the different temperaments come from individuals variations in a person's brain stem, limbic system, and thalamocortical arousal system. These changes are observed by [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG) recordings which monitor brain activity.&lt;ref name="Fourth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=David L|title=How brain arousal systems determine different temperament types and the major dimensions of personality|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=December 2001|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1233–1259|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(00)00211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbic system activation is typically linked to neuroticism, with high activation showing high neuroticism.&lt;ref name=Fifth/&gt; Cortical arousal is associated with introversion–extraversion differences, with high arousal associated with introversion.&lt;ref name=Fifth/&gt; Both the limbic system and the thalamocortical arousal system are influenced by the brainstem activation.&lt;ref name=Fifth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson |first1=David |last2=Gabriel |first2=Norman |last3=Katchan |first3=Olga |title=Personality and second language learning |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=January 1994 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=143–157 |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90118-x |url=http://yunting2.wikispaces.com/file/view/personality+and+second+lg+learning.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015419/http://yunting2.wikispaces.com/file/view/personality%2Band%2Bsecond%2Blg%2Blearning.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's study (1982) concluded that melancholic types had the greatest [[natural frequencies]], or a "predominance of excitation", meaning that melancholics (who are characterized by introversion) have a higher internal level of arousal.&lt;ref name=Fourth /&gt; Sanguine people (or those with high extraversion and low neuroticism) had the lowest overall levels of internal arousal, or a "predominance of inhibition".&lt;ref name=Fourth /&gt; Melancholics also had the highest overall thalamocortical excitation, whereas cholerics (those with high extraversion and high neuroticism) had the lowest intrinsic thalamocortical excitation.&lt;ref name=Fourth /&gt;

The differences in the internal system levels is the evidence that Eysenck used to explain the differences between the introverted and the extroverted. [[Ivan Pavlov]], the founder of [[classical conditioning]], also partook in temperament studies with animals. Pavlov's findings with animals are consistent with Eysenck's conclusions. In his studies, melancholics produced an inhibitory response to all external stimuli, which holds true that melancholics shut out outside arousal, because they are deeply internally aroused.&lt;ref name="Fourth" /&gt; Pavlov found that cholerics responded to stimuli with aggression and excitement whereas melancholics became depressed and unresponsive.&lt;ref name="Fourth" /&gt; The high neuroticism which characterizes both melancholics and cholerics manifested itself differently in the two types because of the different levels of internal arousal they had.

== Emotion ==

=== Cannon–Bard theory ===
The [[Cannon–Bard theory]] is a theory of undifferentiated arousal, where the physical and emotional states occur at the same time in response to an event. This theory states that an emotionally provoking event results in both the physiological arousal and the emotion occurring concurrently.&lt;ref name=Tenth&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/cannon_bard_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person's dear family member dies, a potential physiological response would be tears falling down the person's face and their throat feeling dry; they are "sad". The Cannon–Bard theory states that the tears and the sadness both happen at the same time. The process goes: event (family member dies) → physiological arousal (tears) and emotion (sadness) simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Tenth"/&gt; The fact that people can experience different emotions when they have the same pattern of physiological arousal is one argument in favor of the Cannon-Bard theory. For example, a person may have a heart racing and rapid breathing when they are angry or afraid. Even though not completely in accordance with the theory, it is taken as one piece of evidence in favor of the Cannon–Bard theory that physiological reactions sometimes happen more slowly than experiences of emotion. For example, if you are in the forest or woods, a sudden sound can create an immediate response of fear, while the physical symptoms of fear follow that feeling, and do not precede it.&lt;ref name=Eleventh&gt;{{cite web|title=Theories of Emotion|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/james-lange-cannon-bard-theories-of-emotion.html|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James–Lange theory ===

The [[James–Lange theory]] describes how emotion is caused by the bodily changes which come from the perception of the emotionally arousing experience or environment.&lt;ref name=Sixth /&gt; This theory states that events cause the autonomic nervous system to induce physiological arousal, characterized by muscular tension, heart rate increases, perspiration, dryness of mouth, tears, etc.&lt;ref name=Ninth&gt;{{cite web|title=James-Lange Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/james_lange_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James and Lange, the emotion comes as a result of the physiological arousal.&lt;ref name=Eighth /&gt; The bodily feeling as a reaction to the situation actually is the emotion.&lt;ref name=Sixth /&gt; For example, if someone just deeply insulted a person and their family, the person's fists might ball up and they might begin to perspire and become tense all around. The person feels that their fists are balled and that they are tense. The person then realizes that they are angry. The process here is: event (insult) --&gt; physiological arousal (balled fists, sweat, tension) --&gt; interpretation ("I have balled fists, and tension") --&gt; emotion (anger: "I am angry").&lt;ref name=Eighth /&gt; This type of theory emphasizes the physiological arousal as the key, in that the cognitive processes alone would not be sufficient evidence of an emotion.

=== Schachter–Singer two-factor theory ===

The [[Two-factor theory of emotion|Schachter–Singer two-factor theory]] or the cognitive labeling theory takes into account both the physiological arousal and the cognitive processes that respond to an emotion-provoking situation. Schachter and Singer's theory states that an emotional state is the product of the physiological arousal and the cognition regarding the state of arousal. Thus, cognition determines how the physical response is labeled; for example, as "anger", "joy", or "fear".&lt;ref name=Sixth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=Stanley|last2=Singer|first2=Jerome|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=September 1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, emotion is seen as a product of the interaction between the state of arousal and how one's thought processes appraise the current situation.&lt;ref name=Seventh&gt;{{cite web|title=Schacter and Singer's study of emotion |url=http://learning.covcollege.ac.uk/content/NLN/Health_Care,_Medicine,_Health_And_Safety/Psychology/act_PK1_Schacter_and_Singers_study_of_emotion/FD2427DE-89F1-4E3E-9CB0-2E0FA376BEE0/s05two_factor_theory/010a_twofactors.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223003536/http://learning.covcollege.ac.uk/content/NLN/Health_Care,_Medicine,_Health_And_Safety/Psychology/act_PK1_Schacter_and_Singers_study_of_emotion/FD2427DE-89F1-4E3E-9CB0-2E0FA376BEE0/s05two_factor_theory/010a_twofactors.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 December 2012 |work=Becta Psychology |accessdate=12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological arousal does not provide the label for the emotion; cognition does. For example, if a person is being pursued by a serial killer, the person will likely be sweating and their heart will be racing, which is their physiological state. The person's cognitive label will come from assessing their quickly beating heart and sweat as "fear". Then they will feel the emotion of "fear", but only after it has been established through cognition. The process is: the event (serial killer chasing the person) --&gt; physiological arousal (sweat, heart racing) --&gt; cognitive label (reasoning; "this is fear") --&gt; emotion (fear).&lt;ref name=Eighth&gt;{{cite web|title=Two-Factor Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/two-factor_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memory ==

Arousal is involved in the detection, retention, and retrieval of information in the [[memory]] process. Emotionally arousing information can lead to better memory encoding, therefore influencing better retention and retrieval of information. Arousal is related to [[selective attention]] during the encoding process by showing that people are more subject to encode arousing information than neutral information.&lt;ref name="sharot2004"/&gt; The selectivity of encoding arousing stimuli produces better [[long-term memory]] results than the encoding of neutral stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mickley Steinmetz|first1=Katherine R.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Katherine|last3=Zucker|first3=Halle R.|last4=Kensinger|first4=Elizabeth A.|title=The effect of emotional arousal and retention delay on subsequent-memory effects|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=September 2012|volume=3|issue=3–4|pages=150–159|doi=10.1080/17588928.2012.677421|pmc=3818726}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the retention and accumulation of information is strengthened when exposed to arousing events or information. Arousing information is also retrieved or remembered more vividly and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeong|first1=Eui Jun|last2=Biocca|first2=Frank A.|title=Are there optimal levels of arousal to memory? Effects of arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory in video games|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2012|volume=28|issue=2|pages=285–291|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arousal improves memory under most circumstances, there are some considerations. Arousal at learning is associated more with long-term recall and retrieval of information than short-term recall of information.  For example, one study found that people could remember arousing words better after one week of learning them than merely two minutes after learning them.&lt;ref name="Revelle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Revelle |first=W |title=The implications of arousal effects for the study of affect and memory |url=http://pmc.psych.northwestern.edu/revelle/publications/rl91/rev_loft.arousal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208074812/http://pmc.psych.northwestern.edu/revelle/publications/rl91/rev_loft.arousal.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Another study found that arousal affects the memory of people in different ways. Eysenck found an association between memory and the arousal of introverts versus extroverts.  Higher levels of arousal increased the amount of words retrieved by extroverts and decreased the amount of words retrieved by introverts.&lt;ref name="Revelle"/&gt;

== Preference ==

A person's level of arousal when introduced to stimuli can be indicative of his or her preferences. One study found that familiar stimuli are often preferred to unfamiliar stimuli.  The findings suggested that the exposure to unfamiliar stimuli was correlated to avoidance behaviors. The unfamiliar stimuli may lead to increased arousal and increased avoidance behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramsøy|first1=Thomas Z.|last2=Friis-Olivarius|first2=Morten|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Catrine|last4=Jensen|first4=Simon B.|last5=Skov|first5=Martin|title=Effects of perceptual uncertainty on arousal and preference across different visual domains|journal=Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics|date=2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=212–226|doi=10.1037/a0030198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, increased arousal can increase approach behaviors as well. People are said to make decisions based on their emotional states. They choose specific options that lead to more favorable emotional states.&lt;ref name="Suri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suri|first1=Gaurav|last2=Sheppes|first2=Gal|last3=Gross|first3=James J.|title=Predicting affective choice|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2013|volume=142|issue=3|pages=627–632|doi=10.1037/a0029900|pmc=4153792}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is aroused, he or she may find a wider range of events appealing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariely|first1=Dan|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|title=The heat of the moment: the effect of sexual arousal on sexual decision making|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=April 2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=87–98|doi=10.1002/bdm.501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and view decisions as more salient, specifically influencing [[approach-avoidance conflict]].&lt;ref name="Suri"/&gt; The state of arousal might lead a person to view a decision more positively than he or she would have in a less aroused state.

The reversal theory accounts for the preference of either high or low arousal in different situations. Both forms of arousal can be pleasant or unpleasant, depending on a person's moods and goals at a specific time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Jean|last2=Apter|first2=Michael J.|last3=Svebak|first3=Sven|title=Color preference, arousal, and the theory of psychological reversals|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=September 1982|volume=6|issue=3|pages=193–215|doi=10.1007/bf00992245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt's and Berlyne's hedonic curve differ from this theory. Both theorists explain a person's arousal potential in terms of his or her hedonic tone. These individual differences in arousal demonstrate Eysenck's theory that extroverts prefer increased stimulation and arousal, whereas introverts prefer lower stimulation and arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Revelle|first=W.|title=Arousal Theories|url=http://personality-project.org/revelle/syllabi/205/arousaltheories.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated problems ==

Altered experiences of arousal are associated with both [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

Depression can influence a person's level of arousal by interfering with the right hemisphere's functioning.  Arousal in women has been shown to be slowed in the left visual field due to depression, indicating the influence of the right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liotti|first1=Mario|last2=Tucker|first2=Don M|title=Right hemisphere sensitivity to arousal and depression|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=March 1992|volume=18|issue=2|pages=138–151|doi=10.1016/0278-2626(92)90075-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arousal and anxiety have a different relationship than arousal and depression.  People who suffer from anxiety disorders tend to have abnormal and amplified perceptions of arousal.  The distorted perceptions of arousal then create fear and distorted perceptions of the self.  For example, a person may believe that he or she will get sick from being so nervous about taking an exam.  The fear of the arousal of nervousness and how people will perceive this arousal will then contribute to levels of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibodeau|first1=Michel A.|last2=Gómez-Pérez|first2=Lydia|last3=Asmundson|first3=Gordon J.G.|title=Objective and perceived arousal during performance of tasks with elements of social threat: The influence of anxiety sensitivity|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|date=September 2012|volume=43|issue=3|pages=967–974|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abnormally increased behavioral arousal ==

This is caused by withdrawal from [[alcohol]] or [[barbiturates]], acute [[encephalitis]], [[head trauma]] resulting in [[coma]], partial [[seizures]] in [[epilepsy]], [[metabolic disorders]] of [[electrolyte]] imbalance, Intra-cranial space- occupying lesions, Alzheimer's disease, rabies, hemispheric lesions in stroke and multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref name= "Mirr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirr|first=Michaelene Pheifer|editor1-last=Kunkel|editor1-first=Joyce A.|editor2-last=Stewart-Amidei|editor2-first=Chris|title=AANN's Neuroscience Nursing: Human Responses to Neurologic Dysfunction|chapter=Abnormally Increased Behavioral Arousal|edition=2nd|date=2001|publisher=W.B.

Anatomically this is a disorder of the limbic system, [[hypothalamus]], [[temporal lobes]], [[amygdala]] and [[frontal lobes]].&lt;ref name= "Mirr" /&gt; It is not to be confused with [[mania]].

== Effects of physiological arousal on cognition ==
The effects of physiological arousal on [[cognition]] cause individuals to be active, attentive, or excited.
The term "physiological" refers to [[physiology]] and concerns the normal functioning of an organism. Physiological arousal refers to features of arousal reflected by physiological reactions, such as escalations in [[blood pressure]] and rate of [[Breathing|respiration]] and lessened activity of the [[gastrointestinal system]].
These terms are what allow for the effects physiological arousal has on cognition itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15046-001?doi=1|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognition is internal mental representations best characterized as thoughts and ideas- resulting from and involved in multiple mental processes and operations including perception, reasoning, memory,  intuition, judgement and decision making. While cognition is not directly observable, it is still amenable to study using the scientific method. Cognition is also something that plays a fundamental role in determining behavior. Goes into explaining cognitive functions and how they are internal and inferred from behavior using measure like accuracy in performing a task like recalling a list of words of the time taken to find some word on a page of text.
The study of cognitive [[Cognitive function|functions]] derive from the [[information processing approach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piccinini|first=Gualtiero|last2=Scarantino|first2=Andrea|date=January 2011|title=Information processing, computation, and cognition|journal=Journal of Biological Physics|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–38|doi=10.1007/s10867-010-9195-3|issn=0092-0606|pmc=3006465|pmid=22210958}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that these functions that these functions involve operations occurring at various processing stages is typically based on a model of cognitive function of interest.

Physiological comes from physiology which is the study of the functioning of living organisms, animal or plant, and of the functioning of their constituent tissues or cells. This word was first used by the Greeks to describe a philosophical inquiry into the nature of things. The use of the term with specific reference to vital activities of healthy humans, which began in the 16th century, also applicable to many current aspects of physiology.
Physiological responses to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]:
When the body is initially challenged by a [[stressor]] it responds with physiological activation (also known as arousal) of a defense system to deal with the immediate stressor. "If a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus which is the major nor adrenergic nucleus of the brain, giving rise to fibers innervating extensive areas throughout the [[neuraxis]].  Also referred as the Neuroaxis, is the axis in the central nervous system.  activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. (Thase &amp; Howland 1995)" (psychologistworld.org, n.d.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologistworld.com/stress/fight-or-flight-response|title=How Fight-or-flight Instincts Impact On Your Stress Levels|website=www.psychologistworld.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of non-epinephrine from nerve endings acting on the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. Which can often lead to as the fight or flight response.
Anticipated behaviors are actions that are foreseen or predicted to happen in a specific situation due to different environmental factors. Furthermore, they are decided by one’s past experiences and knowledge.

Anticipated behaviors examples
-Someone sitting in the same seat every day during class.
-Someone reaching their hand out towards you would indicate they are wanting to shake hands.
- While driving a car you would anticipate people braking therefore you would brake as well.
When a loud unexpected noise is created you are startled and flinch.
- When a person sneezes you say “bless you”.

A real life example of cognition is used whenever decision making is involved for example, a real life scenario of a cognitive decision would be when a traffic light is changing from green to yellow. One would either make a cognitive decision to run through the yellow light in hopes you could clear the intersection before the light turned red. However, one could make a different cognitive decision to stop when they see the yellow light to not run the light before it turned red.

A real life example of the effects of physiological arousal on cognition is when you’re walking through the woods and you notice a rattlesnake in front of the walkway on the ground. You would feel alarmed and scared (physiological arousal).Your past experience and knowledge of poisonous snakes and dangerous predators provides the (cognition) of the situation. Based on your analysis of your position you label your arousal as fear.
Fear is explained to be an emotion that one might expect with alarm, it is also known as something to be afraid of or the feelings of apprehensiveness.  Fear works when one senses danger, the brain reacts instantly, sending signals that activate the nervous system. This causes physical responses, such as a faster heartbeat, rapid breathing, and an increase in blood pressure. Blood pumps to muscle groups to prepare the body for physical action like running or fighting. Skin sweats to keep the body cool. Some people might notice sensations in the stomach, head, chest, legs, or hands. These physical sensations of fear can be mild or strong.
A study done by Joan Vickers and Mark Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vickers|first=Joan N.|last2=Williams|first2=A.

The goal was to determine why there might be a failure to perform in high pressure situations. Difficulties come about when trying to test performance pressure, physiological workload, anxiety, and visual attention in a controlled setting. Which is why they decided to test these elite biathlon shooters, due to the easy ability to stimulate the controlled experiment. In the low pressure stimulation the subjects were only told that the purpose of the test was to simply provide feedback and the fixation on the target at different power output levels. In the high pressure situation the shorter were told that the national team coach was going to observe the shooters, and their shooting percentages would be used to make the national team selections. Both groups were told that prizes would be rewarded to the most accurate shooters. To test physiological arousal that was being used, Vickers and Williams measured each shooters heart rate as well as the perceived exertion. Trying to determine if the failure to perform to whatever level of skill or ability the person has at the time, also known as choking; was indeed a factor in this test. Physiological arousal was measured and recorded through the athlete's heart rate and rate of perceived exertion. The findings showed that the biathletes developed the ability to decelerate their heart rate just before they shoot, most only shoot when HR is 80% or lower. Whereas the test was designed for shots to be taken with a heart rate 100% or above. The expectations were for the low pressure and high pressure groups to be more prone to choking compared to those who were able to maintain their heart rates. The findings showed exactly what was expected, the only exception was that the pressure applied did not necessarily have much of an effect. While it was clear that high pressure stimulations did appear far more anxious than those of low pressure stimulations.

[[Problem solving]] is the cognitive process that someone uses to achieve a goal whenever a solution cannot be determined by others.

For example, you are with your buddies on a trip and get a flat tire. Everyone looks around nervously because nobody knows how to change a flat. But then you remember that you took an automotive class in college where you learned to change flat tires. You change the tire and solve the issue with your cognitive problem solving. Cognitively, the utilization of logical analysis and problem solving has been associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, better health, and lower depression in caregivers. A realistic appraisal and acceptance of the difficult situation is healthy and allows the caregiver to live his or her own life while accommodating the needs of the recipient. Less effective cognitive coping styles include avoidant-evasive, regressive, and an increased use of wishfulness and fantasizing by the caregiver, all of which have been related to higher levels of care burden (Hayley et al., 1987; Quayhagen &amp; Quayhagen, 1988).

Cognitive appraisal is the stress perceived as imbalance between demands place on the individual and the individual and the individual's resources to cope.  Lazarus argued that the experience of stress differs significantly between individuals depending on how they interpret an event and the outcome of a specific sequence of thinking patterns called [[Appraisal theory|appraisals]].

It also refers to the personal interpretation of a situation that ultimately influences the extent to which the situation is perceived as stressful, process of assessing whether a situation or event threatens our well being, whether there are sufficient personal resources available for coping with the demand of the situation of whether our strategy for dealing with the situation is effective.

The three parts that it can be divided into are primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and reappraisal. Primary Appraisal is an assessment of how significant an event is for a person, including whether it is a threat or opportunity, also including that no heightened physiological arousal occurs it means no stress will either. Secondary Appraisal considers one's ability to cope or take advantage of the situation. Cognitive Appraisal is a personal interpretation of a situation and possible reactions to it.

Their secondary appraisal determines what the person will do, and involves their perception of their options and resources.

These appraisals can be accurate or inaccurate, and helping a person arrive at more apt appraisals is a goal of some modes of cognitive behavioral therapy, This is a psychosocial intervention that is the most widely used evidence based practice for improving mental health guided by empirical research cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognition, behaviors, and emotional regulation. Also known as regulation of emotion; is the ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible to permit spontaneous reactions as well as the ability to delay spontaneous reactions as needed. It can also be defined as Extrinsic and Intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions. [[Emotional self-regulation]] belongs to the broader set of emotion-regulation processes, which includes the regulations of one's own feelings and the regulations of other people's feelings.

The '''Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation''' was a self-governing student organization, representing multiple [[Beijing]] universities, and acting as the student protesters' principle decision-making body during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig J.

== Origin ==
After former [[General Secretary]] [[Hu Yaobang]]'s death on April 15, students mobilized spontaneously&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; both to mourn Hu's passing and to demand democratic reform in China.&lt;ref&gt;King and Cushman, ''Political Communication'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, at [[Peking University]] (Beida), a meeting was anonymously organized to discuss the ongoing protests in the Square, as well as the prospect of forming an autonomous student organization.&lt;ref name=Wright150&gt;Wright, "State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China," 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting, in essence, was a "democracy salon"—an unofficial student discussion group that students at Beida had founded by the former Beida physics [[graduate student]] [[Liu Gang]] months before Hu Yaobang's death.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The salon decided that an autonomous organization was necessary to coordinate student protesters on multiple Beijing campuses.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; However, for fear of punishment by the government, few at the meeting were willing to speak out.&lt;ref name="Wright150"/&gt; Those who did, including history student [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], became the leaders of the newly formed Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref name=Li159&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aim of the new Federation was the rejection of the official student organizations.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; According to one student announcement, "the leadership of the original union is inept, has sold out the students' interests…and is completely unable to represent the students' wishes."&lt;ref name="Calhoun41"/&gt; In this way, the student protesters saw the Federation as representing the wishes of the entire student body.&lt;ref name=Francis904 /&gt; The Federation planned to seek legitimacy by strict observance of democratic policies such as elections and group decision-making.&lt;ref name=Calhoun53&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The students hoped these methods would ensure the organization's unity of leadership,&lt;ref name=Francis908&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 908.&lt;/ref&gt; and would effectively contrast with the lack of transparency they perceived in the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Calhoun53"/&gt; On May 23, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation established officially at [[Liu Gang]]'s residence near [[Yuanmingyuan]], during the first meeting, the students had elected  [[Zhou Yongjun]] as the first chairman of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Cheng, ''Standoff at Tiananmen'' (Sensys Corporation, 2009), 88-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, ''[[People's Daily]]'' published the editorial [[April 26 Editorial|"It is Necessary to Take a Clear-Cut Stand Against Turmoil"]],&lt;ref name=Wright154&gt;Wright, "State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China," 154.&lt;/ref&gt; attributing the protests to "a small minority" attempting to "poison people's minds" and "create national turmoil."&lt;ref name=Francis909&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 909.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation was officially established.&lt;ref name="Saich190"/&gt; At their meeting, around 2,000 students elected a seven-person committee to lead the Federation.&lt;ref name="Li159"/&gt; Concerned by the April 26 editorial, the Federation decided that, as an illegal organization, it needed to reinforce its legitimacy by showing its popular support.&lt;ref name="Wright154"/&gt; To achieve this goal, the Federation organized a demonstration to take place on April 27.&lt;ref name="Wright154"/&gt;

== Dialogue and Recognition ==
Between April 16 and 26, the government had dismissed the autonomous students' demands for recognition and dialogue.&lt;ref name="King121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis907"/&gt; The government, unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the independent student unions,&lt;ref name="Francis908"/&gt; had attempted instead to arrange talks with individual student leaders.&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; Although the student protesters believed they were acting patriotically&lt;ref name="Li159"/&gt; and morally,&lt;ref&gt;Saich, "The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement," 191.&lt;/ref&gt; the Communist leadership saw the students' demands as a threat to political and social order.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 915.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the students had difficulty obtaining their goal of direct dialogue with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[April 27 Demonstration|April 27 student demonstrations]],&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; the government held its first dialogue with the Federation leaders on April 29.&lt;ref name="King121"/&gt; However, the government avoided direct contact with the Federation, instead inviting student leaders to meet on an individual basis.&lt;ref name=Calhoun56&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While some students saw the government's offer as a victory,&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; others felt that they should only attend the dialogue as recognized representatives of the Federation.&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun56"/&gt; [[Wuer Kaixi]], a Federation leader, attended the dialogue as a "private individual",&lt;ref name="Calhoun56"/&gt; but decided to leave midway through to protest the government's lack of recognition of the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 910.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the dialogue, Wuer Kaixi later described it as a "trick of the government to destroy the student solidarity."&lt;ref name=King122&gt;King and Cushman, ''Political Communication'', 122.&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman Yuan Mu insisted that the Communist Party and the student protesters shared the same goals.&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt;

On May 1, the Federation rejected the legitimacy of the April 29 dialogue in a news conference.&lt;ref name="Francis911"/&gt; The following day, the Federation presented a twelve-point petition, including a demand that future government efforts at dialogue be sincere.&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; Although the government rejected this petition,&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; the petition represented a compromise on the students' part, as [[Amnesty International]] researcher Corinna-Barbara Francis suggests.&lt;ref name=Francis912&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 912.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, instead of demanding explicit government recognition, the students only asked for dialogue "on the basis of full equality between the two parties."&lt;ref name="Francis912"/&gt; By May 29, the students' demands were reduced to two: denunciation of the April 26 editorial by the government and acknowledgement of the federation's democratic nature.&lt;ref name="Francis912"/&gt;

== Division and Decline ==
[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen]], taken on 10 May 1989.]]
On May 4, the Federation successfully organized a demonstration of over 100,000 protesters in Tiananmen Square, marking the 70-year anniversary of the [[May 4 Movement|1919 May 4 Movement]].&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt; Also on May 4, the Federation decided to end the boycott on class attendance it had begun on April 24.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 905.&lt;/ref&gt; This sudden and unexpected end to the boycott, and loss of momentum in student-government negotiations, resulted in a loss of student enthusiasm for the protests.&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; As student leader [[Chai Ling]] noted "the movement dwindled to a low point as more and more students returned to classes."&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reinvigorate the movement, Chai Ling and other students started a [[hunger strike]] on the Square.&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt; Although the Federation initially opposed the hunger strikers during its May 12 meeting, it eventually decided to support individual strikers, but avoided official endorsement of the Hunger Strike Group.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; As the protests continued throughout May and into June, the Hunger Strike Group would take control of events in the Square, and would largely displace the authority previously held by the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dingxin Zhao, ''The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement'' (University of Chicago Press, 2008), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government Response ==
Speaking with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]] [[Zhao Ziyang]] on May 4, [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] voiced his concern over the ongoing protests in the Square.&lt;ref name=Zhang117&gt;Liang Zhang, Andrew J Nathan, and E. Perry Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'' (New York: PublicAffairs, 2002), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; While Zhao Ziyang contended that the April 26 editorial had encouraged student protesters, Li Peng contended that this was too simple an explanation for the growth of the protest movement, suggesting that the April 26 editorial "did not accuse the vast majority of students of creating turmoil."&lt;ref name="Zhang117"/&gt; Li Peng also opposed to the student protester's demands for negotiation.&lt;ref name=Zhang118&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Voicing concern over the rising prominence of the "illegal student organizations," &lt;ref name="Zhang117"/&gt; Li objected to the Federation's desire "to negotiate with the Party and government as equals" and saw the students' twelve-point petition as a "threat."&lt;ref name="Zhang118"/&gt; In his conversation with Zhao, Li also asserted that the Federation's primary goal was to "negate the leadership of the CCP and negate the entire socialist system."&lt;ref name="Zhang118"/&gt;

On May 13, after the hunger striker's announced their plan, [[Yan Mingfu]], Director of the Party's [[United Front Work Department]], met with a number of intellectuals and student protesters, including Wang Dan, Chai Ling, and Wuer Kaixi.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Yan Mingfu suggested that if the student protesters stopped their hunger strike and instead submitted their "demands and suggestions through proper channels," he could assure them that "the door to dialogue" would remain open.&lt;ref name=Zhang159&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when he later briefed Zhao Ziyang on the meeting, Yan Mingfu shared his unease at the divisions he observed among the student protesters: "the AFS [the Federation], the Dialogue Delegation, and representatives of the hunger strikers…are in disagreement among themselves…I'm not sure any of them truly represents the hunger strikers or can exert any influence on them."&lt;ref name="Zhang159"/&gt;

In [[pollution abatement]], the '''best available technology''' (or '''BAT''') is the technology approved for limiting pollutant discharges with regard to an abatement strategy. Similar terms are ''best available techniques'', ''best practicable means'' or ''best practicable environmental option''. BAT is a moving target on practices, since developing societal values and advancing techniques may change what is currently regarded as "reasonably achievable", "best practicable" and "best available".

A literal understanding will connect it with a "spare no expense" [[doctrine]] which prescribes the acquisition of the best state of the art [[technology]] available, without regard for traditional [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uci.edu/lawreview/vol4/no4/Sinden.pdf |title=Cost-Benefit Analysis, Ben Franklin, and the Supreme Court  |last1=Sinden |first1=Amy |date=2014 |website=UC Irvine Law Review |publisher=University of California, Irvine School of Law |access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practical use, the cost aspect is also taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorrell |first=Steve |title=The Meaning of BATNEEC: Interpreting Excessive Costs in UK Industrial Pollution Regulation |publisher=sussex.ac.uk |date=2001-02-19 |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp61/sewp61.html |accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [See also discussions on the topic of the [[precautionary principle]] which, along with considerations of ''best available technologies'' and ''cost-benefit analyses'', is also involved in discussions leading to formulation of environmental policies and regulations (or opposition to same).]

''Best practicable means'' was used for the first time in UK national primary legislation in section 5 of the Salmon Fishery Act 1861&lt;ref name="BestPracticableMeans" /&gt; and another early use was found in the [[Alkali Act]] Amendment Act 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Bob |title=BPM/BPEO vs BAT - A personal view |publisher=bnes.com |date=n.d. |url=http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202060742/http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-date=2004-02-02 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but before that appeared in the Leeds Act of 1848.

The ''BAT'' concept was first time used in the 1992 [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic for all types of industrial installations (for instance, [[chemical plant|chemical plants]]).

Some doctrine deem it already acquired the status of [[customary law]].

In the [[United States]], BAT or similar terminology is used in the [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] and [[Clean Water Act]].

==European Union directives==

''Best available techniques not entailing excessive costs (BATNEEC)'', sometimes referred to as ''best available technology'', was introduced in 1984 with Directive 84/360/EEC and applied to air pollution emissions from large industrial installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31984L0360&amp;from=EN Council Directive 84/360/EEC] (PDF; 496&amp;nbsp;kB) of 28 June 1984 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plants.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Directive 84/360/EEC was superseded by the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control|Integrated pollution prevention and control directive]] (IPPC), 96/61/EC, which applied the framework concept of ''Best Available Techniques'' (BAT) to the integrated control of pollution to the three media air, water and soil. The concept is also part of the directive's recast in 2008 (2008/1/EC) and its successor directive, the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] 2010/75/EU published in 2010.

According to article 15(2) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], emission limit values and the equivalent parameters and technical measures in permits shall be based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0075&amp;from=EN Directive 2010/75/EU] (PDF; 2.78&amp;nbsp;MB) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control).&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive includes a definition of best available techniques in article 3(10):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"best available techniques" means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicates the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and other permit conditions designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole:
:    - "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;
:    - "available" means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;
:    - "best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

BAT for a given industrial sector are described in BAT reference documents (BREFs) as defined in article 3(11) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]]. BREFs are the result of an exchange of information between [[European Union]] Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the [[European Commission]] pursuant to article 13 of the directive. This exchange of information is often called the Sevilla process because it is steered by the [[Institute for Prospective Technological Studies]] of the European Commissions' [[Joint Research Centre]], which is based in Seville. The process is described in detail in Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012D0119&amp;from=EN Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU] (PDF; 1.54&amp;nbsp;MB) of 10 February 2012 laying down rules concerning guidance on the collection of data and on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance referred to in Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important chapter of the BREFs, the BAT conclusions, are published as implementing decisions of the [[European Commission]] in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]]. According to article 14(3) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], the BAT conclusions shall be the reference for setting permit conditions of large industrial installations.

==United States environmental law==
===Clean Air Act===
The [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] requires that certain facilities employ [[Best Available Control Technology]] to control [[air pollution|emissions]].
: ...an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning, clean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of each such pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act of 1990, section 169(3), {{USC|42|7479(3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean Water Act===
The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires issuance of national [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] discharge regulations (called "[[effluent guidelines]]"), which are based on BAT and several related standards.
: ...effluent limitations for categories and classes of point sources,... which (i) shall require application of the best available technology economically achievable for such category or class, which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA) section 301(b), {{USC|33|1311(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ...Factors relating to the assessment of best available technology shall take into account the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(b), {{USC|33|1314(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of the effluent standards, the BAT concept is a "model" technology rather than a specific regulatory requirement. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) identifies a particular model technology for an industry, and then writes a regulatory performance standard based on the model. The performance standard is typically expressed as a numeric effluent limit measured at the discharge point. The industrial facility may use any technology that meets the performance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related CWA provision for [[water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water]] intake structures requires standards based on "best technology available."
: ...the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 316(b), {{USC|33|1326(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conventions==

The concept of BAT is also used in a number of international conventions such as the [[Minamata Convention]] on Mercury, the [[Stockholm Convention]] on Persistent Organic Pollutants, or the [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic.

'''The Bill of Rights''', also known as the '''English Bill of Rights''', is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] that sets out certain basic [[civil rights]] and clarifies who would be next to inherit [[the Crown]]. It received the [[Royal Assent]] on 16 December 1689 and is a restatement in [[Statute|statutory form]] of the [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]] presented by the [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in February 1689, inviting them to become joint sovereigns of [[Kingdom of England|England]]. The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the [[monarch]] and sets out the rights of Parliament, including the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, and [[freedom of speech]] in Parliament. It sets out certain rights of individuals including the prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and reestablished the right of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to [[right to bear arms|have arms for their defence]] within the [[rule of law]]. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights described and condemned several misdeeds of [[James II]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown. ... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’. {{cite web |title=Britain's unwritten constitution |url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas reflected those of the political thinker [[John Locke]] and they quickly became popular in England.{{sfn|Schwoerer|1990|pp=531–548}} It also sets out – or, in the view of its drafters, restates – certain constitutional requirements of [[the Crown]] to seek the consent of the people, as represented in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maurice Adams |author2=Anne Meuwese |author3=Ernst Hirsch Ballin |title=Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law: Bridging Idealism and Realism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oY7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |via=Google Books |year=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the Bill of Rights is further accompanied by [[Magna Carta]], the [[Petition of Right]], the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]] as some of the basic documents of the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]]. A separate but similar document, the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], applies in [[Scotland]]. The Bill of Rights 1689 was one of the inspirations for the [[United States Bill of Rights]].

Along with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], the Bill of Rights is still in effect in all [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending both of them came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26&amp;nbsp;March 2015.

==Background==
During the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century |title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17thth&amp;nbsp;century |website=The British Library |access-date=2017-10-16 |postscript=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century |website=The Society of Antiquaries of London |access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament of England passed the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origins and growth of Parliament |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/citizen_subject/origins.htm |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rise of Parliament |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/citizenship2.htm |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Putney debates |url=https://www.bl.uk/taking-liberties/articles/putney-debates |publisher=The British Library |accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[the Protectorate]] (1653–1659) and the [[English Restoration]] (1660) restored more autocratic rule although Parliament passed the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] in 1679, which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence.

===Glorious Revolution===
{{Main|Glorious Revolution}}
Objecting to the policies of [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[James II of England]] (James&amp;nbsp;VII of Scotland and James&amp;nbsp;II of Ireland), a group of English Parliamentarians invited the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]] (William of Orange) to overthrow the King. William's successful invasion with a Dutch fleet and army led to James fleeing to France. In December&amp;nbsp;1688, William took over the provisional government by appointment of the peers of the realm, as was the legal right of the latter in circumstances when the King was incapacitated, and summoned an assembly of certain members of parliament. This assembly called for an [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Convention Parliament]] to be elected, which convened on 22&amp;nbsp;January 1689.{{sfn|Anon.|2010|pp=2–4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher= British Library|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of Right===
{{Main|Declaration of Right, 1689}}
[[File:Samuel Wale, The Bill of Rights Ratified at the Revolution by King William, and Queen Mary, Previous to their Coronation (1783).jpg|thumb|An 18th&amp;nbsp;century engraving, based on a drawing by [[Samuel Wale]], of the Bill of Rights being presented to [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]]]]
The proposal to draw up a statement of rights and liberties and James's violation of them was first made on 29&amp;nbsp;January 1689 in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with members arguing that the House "cannot answer it to the nation or Prince of Orange till we declare what are the rights invaded" and that William "cannot take it ill if we make conditions to secure ourselves for the future" in order to "do justice to those who sent us hither". On 2&amp;nbsp;February a committee specially convened reported to the Commons 23&amp;nbsp;Heads of Grievances, which the Commons approved and added some of their own. However, on 4&amp;nbsp;February the Commons decided to instruct the committee to differentiate between "such of the general heads, as are introductory of new laws, from those that are declaratory of ancient rights". On 7&amp;nbsp;February the Commons approved this revised Declaration of Right, and on 8&amp;nbsp;February instructed the committee to put into a single text the Declaration (with the heads which were "introductory of new laws" removed), the resolution of 28&amp;nbsp;January and the Lords' proposal for a revised oath of allegiance. It passed the Commons without division.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=12}}

On 13&amp;nbsp;February the clerk of the House of Lords read the Declaration of Right, and the [[George Savile, 1st&amp;nbsp;Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], in the name of all the estates of the realm, asked William and Mary to accept the throne. William replied for his wife and himself: "We thankfully accept what you have offered us". They then went in procession to the great gate at Whitehall. The [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King at Arms]] proclaimed them King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, whereupon they adjourned to the Chapel Royal, with the [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Bishop of London]] preaching the sermon.{{sfn |Carpenter|1956|pp=145–146}} They were crowned on 11&amp;nbsp;April, swearing an oath to uphold the laws made by Parliament. The [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]]  had provided a new coronation oath, whereby the monarchs were to "solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same". They were also to maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed faith established by law.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=37–39}} This replaced an oath which had deferred more to the monarch. The previous oath required the monarch to rule based on "the laws and customs ... granted by the Kings of England".&lt;ref name=refUKPBoR&gt;{{cite web|title= The Convention and Bill of Rights|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/billofrights/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Declaration of Right was enacted in an Act of Parliament, the Bill of Rights 1689, which received the [[Royal Assent]] in December&amp;nbsp;1689.{{sfn|Thatcher|1907|pp=10}} The Act asserted "certain ancient rights and liberties" by declaring that:{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=28–29}}
* the pretended power of suspending the laws and dispensing with{{refn|group="nb"|i.e. ignoring}} laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal;
* the [[Ecclesiastical Commission of 1686|commission for ecclesiastical]] causes is illegal;
* levying taxes without grant of Parliament is illegal;
* it is the right of the subjects to [[petition]] the king, and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;
* keeping a [[standing army]] in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law;{{refn|Arguably, this right is subject to continuing [[derogation]] in modern times; see, for example, [[Armed Forces Act]] and discussion of the same in [[Military Covenant]].|group="nb"}}
* Protestants may have [[Right to keep and bear arms|arms for their defence]] suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law;
* election of members of Parliament ought to be free;
* the [[freedom of speech]] and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be [[Parliamentary privilege|impeached or questioned]] in any court or place out of Parliament;
* [[excessive bail]] ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s inflicted;
* jurors in trials for high treason ought to be freeholders;
* promises of fines and forfeitures before conviction are illegal and void;
* for redress of all grievances, and for the amending, strengthening and preserving of the laws, Parliaments ought to be held frequently.

The Act declared James' flight from England following the [[Glorious Revolution]] to be an [[abdication]] of the throne. It listed twelve of James's policies by which James designed to "endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=26}} These were:{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=27}}
* by assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws and the execution of laws without consent of Parliament;
* by prosecuting the [[Seven Bishops]]; by establishing of the court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes;
* by levying taxes for the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative as if the same was granted by Parliament;
* by raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace without consent of Parliament;
* by causing Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law;
* by violating the freedom of election of members to serve in Parliament;
* by prosecutions in the Court of King's Bench for matters and causes cognizable only in Parliament, and by divers other arbitrary and illegal courses;
* by employing unqualified persons on juries in trials, and jurors in trials for high treason which were not freeholders;
* by imposing excessive bail on persons committed in criminal cases against the laws made for the liberty of the subjects;
* by imposing excessive fines and illegal and cruel punishments;
* by making several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgment against the persons upon whom the same were to be levied;
* all which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and statutes and freedom of this realm.

In a prelude to the Act of Settlement to come twelve years later, the Bill of Rights barred [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] from the throne of England as "it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince"; thus [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]] were named as the successors of James II and that the throne would pass from them first to Mary's heirs, then to her sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne of Denmark]] and her heirs (and, thereafter, to any heirs of William by a later marriage).

==Date and title==
The Bill of Rights is commonly dated in legal contexts to 1688. This convention arises from the [[legal fiction]] (prior to the passage of the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]]) that an [[Act of Parliament]] came into force on the first day of the session in which it was passed. The Bill was therefore deemed to be effective from 13&amp;nbsp;February 1689 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]), or, under the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style calendar]] in use at the time, 13&amp;nbsp;February 1688. Under the [[Short Titles Act 1896]], the Bill was given the official [[short title]] of "The Bill of Rights", without a calendar year suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2#reference-c2144673 |title=Bill of Rights [1688] |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |at=note X1 |accessdate=14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augmentation and effect==
{{See also|Glorious Revolution#Legacy}}
The Bill of Rights was later supplemented by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] (which was agreed to by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] as part of the [[Treaty of Union]]). The Act of Settlement altered the line of succession to the throne laid out in the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Act of Settlement|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/actofsettlement/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the Bill of Rights and the Claim of Right contributed a great deal to the establishment of the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the curtailment of the powers of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;This vigorous assertion of the rights of the subject meant that the Bill of Rights is often seen as parallel in importance with Magna Carta itself. {{cite web |title=The Bill of Rights |url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-bill-of-rights |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the Bill of Rights attacked the abuse of prerogative power rather than prerogative power itself, it had the virtue of enshrining in statute what many regarded as ancient rights and liberties. However, some historians maintain that a more profound change in the relationship between sovereign and Parliament emerged as a result of the financial settlement that Parliament negotiated with William and Mary. {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm |title=Rise of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects. ... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. {{cite web |title=Constitutionalism: America &amp; Beyond |url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html |department=Bureau of International Information Programs |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html |archive-date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading, ultimately, to the establishment of [[constitutional monarchy]],{{sfn|Walker|2009|p=2: "thereby establishing a constitutional monarchy"}} while also (along with the [[Penal law (Britain)|penal laws]]) settling the political and religious turmoil that had convulsed Scotland, England and Ireland in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.

The Bill of Rights (1689) reinforced the [[Petition of Right]] (1628) and the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] (1679) by codifying certain rights and liberties. Described by [[William Blackstone]] as ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the rights expressed in these Acts became associated with the idea of the [[rights of Englishmen]].{{sfn|Billias|2011|p=54}} The Bill of Rights directly influenced the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights#Drafting and adoption|Virginia Declaration of Rights]],{{refn|Section Seven of the Virginia Declaration of Rights reads,
:That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised.
which strongly echoes the first two "ancient rights and liberties" asserted in the Bill of Rights 1689:
:That the pretended power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal;
:That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late, is illegal;

And the Virginia Declaration's Section Nine, 
:That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
is borrowed word for word from the Bill of Rights 1689.|group="nb"}} which in turn influenced the [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Maier|1997|pp=126–28}}

Although not a comprehensive statement of civil and political liberties, the Bill of Rights stands as one of the landmark documents in the development of [[civil liberties in the United Kingdom]] and a model for later, more general, statements of rights;&lt;ref name=refUKPBoR /&gt; these include the [[United States Bill of Rights]], the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco2011"&gt;All the main principles of the Bill of Rights are still in force today, and the Bill of Rights continues to be cited in legal cases in the UK and in Commonwealth countries. It has a primary place in a wider national historical narrative of documents which established the rights of Parliament and set out universal civil liberties, starting with Magna Carta in 1215. It also has international significance, as it was a model for the US Bill of Rights 1789, and its influence can be seen in other documents which establish rights of human beings, such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. {{cite web |title=2011 UK Memory of the World Register |url=http://www.unesco.org.uk/2011-uk-memory-of-the-world-register |publisher=United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/facts-about-the-bill-of-rights-on-its-220th-anniversary |title=Facts About the Bill of Rights on Its 220th Anniversary |date=15 December 2011 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=29 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215342/http://www.history.com/news/facts-about-the-bill-of-rights-on-its-220th-anniversary |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as with the Bill of Rights 1689, the [[US Constitution#Influences|US Constitution]] prohibits excessive bail and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]". Similarly, "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" is banned under Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article&amp;nbsp;3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Legal status==
The Bill of Rights remains in statute and continues to be cited in legal proceedings in the United Kingdom and other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, particularly Article&amp;nbsp;9 on [[Parliamentary privilege|parliamentary freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Lock|1989|pp=540–561}}&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite web |author=Toporoski, Richard |url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617074036/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archivedate=17 June 1997 |title=''Monarchy Canada'': The Invisible Crown |date=Summer 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement 1701 came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26&amp;nbsp;March 2015 which changed the laws of succession to the British throne.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Quebec the validity of the Canadian parliament's [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013|legislation]] is under [[Judicial review in Canada|judicial review]]. {{cite news |author=Blanchfield, Mike |date=22 July 2013 |title=Quebec government to mount legal challenge to new royal succession law |newspaper=National Post |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/quebec-government-to-mount-legal-challenge-to-new-royal-succession-law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Bill of Rights remains in statute in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

===United Kingdom===
The Bill of Rights applies in [[England and Wales]]; it was enacted in the [[Kingdom of England]] which at the time included Wales. [[Scotland]] has its own legislation, the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], passed before the Act of Union between England and Scotland. There are doubts as to whether, or to what extent, the Bill of Rights applies in [[Northern Ireland]].{{sfn|Lock|1989|pp=540–561}}{{refn|group=nb|The United Kingdom consists of four countries and three distinct legal systems: [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Guide to the UK Legal System |url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/United_Kingdom.html |department=Hauser Global Law School Program |publisher=New York University School of Law |accessdate=16 March 2016 |date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Legal System of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/the_uk_legal_system.aspx |publisher=The Chartered Institute of Legal Executives |accessdate=16 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313232551/http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/the_uk_legal_system.aspx |archivedate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These jurisdictions have particular legal considerations of their own, arising from differences in [[English law]], [[Scots law]] and [[Northern Ireland law]].}}

On 21&amp;nbsp;July 1995 a [[libel]] case brought by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] (then a member of parliament) against ''[[The Guardian]]'' was stopped after Justice May ruled that the Bill of Rights' prohibition on the courts' ability to question parliamentary proceedings would prevent ''The Guardian'' from obtaining a [[fair trial|fair hearing]]. Section 13 of the [[Defamation Act 1996]], was subsequently enacted to permit [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s to waive their [[parliamentary privilege]] and thus cite their own speeches if relevant to litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alexander Horne |author2=Oonagh Gay |title=Ending the Hamilton Affair? |url=http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2014/05/21/alexander-horne-and-oonagh-gay-ending-the-hamilton-affair/ |publisher=UK Constitutional Law Association Blog |accessdate=19 March 2015 |date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] in 2016, the Bill of Rights was quoted in a court ruling on a legal challenge seeking a judicial declaration that [[R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|triggering EU exit must first be authorised by an act of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;This subordination of the Crown (i.e. the executive government) to law is the foundation of the rule of law in the United Kingdom. It has its roots well before the war between the Crown and Parliament in the seventeenth century but was decisively confirmed in the settlement arrived at with the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and has been recognised ever since,&lt;br&gt;Sir Edward Coke reports the considered view of himself and the senior judges of the time in The [[Case of Proclamations]] (1610) 12&amp;nbsp;Co. Rep.&amp;nbsp;74, that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm"
and that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him."
The position was confirmed in the first two parts of Section&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights 1688:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Suspending power – That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regall authority without consent of Parlyament is illegall.
:Late dispensing power – That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regall authoritie as it hath beene assumed and exercised of late is illegall."

===New Zealand===
The Bill of Rights was invoked in New Zealand in the 1976 case of ''[[Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Constitutional Setting |url=http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?docid=4277&amp;pageno=3 |publisher=States Services Commission, New Zealand |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016073216/http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?docid=4277 |archivedate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which centred on the purporting of newly appointed Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] that he would advise the [[Governor-General]] to abolish a [[superannuation]] scheme established by the New Zealand Superannuation Act, 1974, without new legislation. Muldoon felt that the dissolution would be immediate and he would later introduce a bill in parliament to retroactively make the abolition legal. This claim was challenged in court and the [[Chief Justice]] declared that Muldoon's actions were illegal as they had violated Article&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights, which provides "that the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority ... is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The legitimacy of judicial review of executive decision-making|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/publications_and_submissions/lawtalk/2010_issues/lawtalk,_issue_743/the_legitimacy_of_judicial_review_of_executive_decision-making |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204112322/http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/publications_and_submissions/lawtalk/2010_issues/lawtalk,_issue_743/the_legitimacy_of_judicial_review_of_executive_decision-making |archivedate=4 February 2010 |publisher=New Zealand Law Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two special designs of commemorative [[British Two Pound coin|two pound coins]] were issued in the United Kingdom in 1989 to celebrate the [[tercentenary]] of the Glorious Revolution. One referred to the Bill of Rights and the other to the Claim of Right.

In May&amp;nbsp;2011, the Bill of Rights was inscribed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[UK Memory of the World Register]] recognizing that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Life, death and everything in between |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2011/may/unesco-parliamentary-documents/|publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=4 June 2011 |date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charnel ground''' (Devanagari:  श्मशान; Romanized Sanskrit: śmaśān; Tibetan pronunciation: durtrö; {{bo|t=དུར་ཁྲོད|w=dur khrod}}),&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"&gt;Rigpa Shedra (July 2009). 'Charnel ground'. Source: [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Charnel_ground] (accessed: Saturday December 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in concrete terms, is an above-ground site for the putrefaction of bodies, generally human, where formerly living tissue is left to decompose uncovered.  Although it may have demarcated locations within it functionally identified as burial grounds, [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and [[crematorium|crematoria]], it is distinct from these as well as from [[crypt]]s or [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]s.

In a religious sense, it is also a very important location for [[sadhana]] and ritual activity for Indo-Tibetan traditions of [[Dharma]] particularly those traditions iterated by the [[Tantra|Tantric]] view such as [[Kashmiri Shaivism]], [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tradition, [[Esoteric Buddhism]], [[Vajrayana]], [[Mantrayana]], [[Dzogchen]], and the [[sadhana]] of [[Chöd]], [[Phowa]] and [[Zhitro]], etc. The charnel ground is also an archetypal [[liminality]] that figures prominently in the literature and liturgy and as an artistic motif in Dharmic Traditions and cultures iterated by the more [[antinomian]] and esoteric aspects of traditional Indian culture.

==India==
Throughout [[History of India|Ancient India]] and [[Medieval India]], charnel grounds in the form of open air [[crematoria]] were historically often located along rivers and many ancient famous charnel sites are now 'sanitized' pilgrimage sites (Sanskrit: [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]]) and areas of significant domestic income through cultural tourism. However, proper "charnel grounds" can still be found in India, specially near large rivers banks and areas where abandoned people (without family) are cremated or simply left to decompose. These areas are often frequented by [[Aghori]]s, a [[Kapalika]] sect, that follows similar meditation techniques, as those thought by the 84 [[Mahasiddha]]s. A typical Aghori sadhana (at the charnel ground) lasts for 12 years.

==Himalayan 'sky burial'==
In the [[Himalaya]] where tillable topsoil for burial and fuel for cremation is scarce and a valuable commodity, the location of a so-called [[sky burial]] is identified with a charnel ground.&lt;ref name="Gold, Peter 1994 p.141"&gt;Gold, Peter (1994). ''Navajo and Tibetan Sacred Wisdom:  The Circle of the Spirit'' (Paperback). Inner Traditions.  {{ISBN|0-89281-411-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89281-411-4}}, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sutrayana and Early Buddhism==
In the [[Pali Canon]] discourses, the Buddha frequently instructs his disciples to seek out a secluded dwelling (in a forest, under the shade of a tree, mountain, glen, hillside cave, charnel ground, jungle grove, in the open, or on a heap of straw).&lt;ref&gt;In these suttas, the Buddha instructs monks to stay in the forest in order to aid their meditation practice DN 2,DN 11,DN 12,DN 16,  MN 4,MN 10, MN 27,MN 39,MN 60,MN 66,MN 101, MN 105, MN 107, MN 125, AN 4.259, AN 5.75, AN 5.76, AN 5.114, AN 10.60, Sn 1.12, Sn 3.11, SN 11.3, SN 22.80, This list is not exhaustive as there are many more related suttas.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Sutrayana]] tradition of the 'Nine Cemetery Contemplations' (Pali: nava sīvathikā-manasikāra) of the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' demonstrate that charnel ground meditations were part of [[Early Buddhism]].

'Cemetery contemplations', as described in ''[[Mahasatipatthana Sutta]]'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]]: 22)  and the ''[[Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]]'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]]: 10):

{{Quote|...have as their objects a corpse one or two or three days old, swollen up, blue-black in colour, full of corruption; a corpse eaten by crows, etc.; a framework of bones; flesh hanging from it, bespattered with blood, held together by the sinews; without flesh and blood, but still held together by the sinews; bones scattered in all direction; bleached and resembling shells; heaped together after the lapse of years; weathered and crumbled to dust.

At the end of each of these contemplations there follows the conclusion: "This body of mine also has this nature, has this destiny, cannot escape it.

Similar are the 10 objects of loathsomeness (asubha q.v.).|&lt;ref&gt;Nyanatiloka (1980). ''Buddhist Dictionary: Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines.''

==Polysemy and metaphor==
{{cleanup|section|date=March 2012}}
On the face of it or alternatively the cosmetic level, the charnel ground is simply a locality often [[chthonic]] where bodies are disposed of, either by [[cremation]] or [[burial]].&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  Though the charnel ground is to be understood as a polysemy and metaphor it must be emphasized that holy people as part of their sadhana and natural spiritual evolution grappling with death, impermanence and transition did historically in both India, China and Tibet as well as in other localities, frequent charnel grounds, crematoriums and cemeteries and were often feared and despised by people who did not understand their 'proclivities' (Sanskrit: anusaya).

From a deeper structural significance and getting to the substantive bones of the Vajrayana spiritual point of view however, the charnel ground is full of profound [[Transpersonal psychology|transpersonal]] significance. It represents the 'death of [[Ego (religion)|ego]]' (Sanskrit: atmayajna), and the end of: 
*'''attachment''' (Sanskrit: ''[[Upādāna]]''; Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/len_pa len pa]'') to this body and life
*'''craving''' (Sanskrit: ''[[tṛṣṇā|{{IAST|Tṛṣṇā}}]]''; Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sred_pa sred pa]'') for a body and life in the future
*'''fear of death''' (Sanskrit: abhiniveśa)
*'''aversion''' (Sanskrit: dveṣa; Wylie: zhe sdang)  to the decay of 'impermanence' (Sanskrit: [[anitya]]).&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;
It is worth noting that 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above cited in bold font are somewhat standardized and hence less-rich lexical choices for the [[semantic field]] represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesha]]) they denote.

Prior to spiritual realization, charnel grounds are to be understood as terrifying places, full of 'roaming spirits' (Sanskrit: [[gana]]) and '[[hungry ghosts]]' (Sanskrit: [[pretas]]) indeed localities that incite consuming fear. In a charnel ground there are bodies everywhere in different states of decomposition: freshly dead bodies, decaying bodies, skeletons and disembodied bones.&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;

[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;127) conveys how the 'charnel ground' experience may present itself in the modern Western [[mindstream]] situations of emotional intensity, protracted peak performance, marginalization and extreme desperation:

{{quote|In contemporary Western society, the charnel ground might be a prison, a homeless shelter, the welfare roll, or a factory assembly line. The key to its successful support of practice is its desperate, hopeless, or terrifying quality. For that matter, there are environments that appear prosperous and privileged to others but are charnel grounds for their inhabitants--Hollywood, Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Washington, D.C. These are worlds in which extreme competitiveness, speed, and power rule, and the actors in their dramas experience intense emotion, ambition, and fear. The intensity of their dynamics makes all of these situations ripe for the Vajrayana practice of the charnel ground.|&lt;ref name="Simmer-Brown 2001 p.127"&gt;[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown, Judith]] (2001). ''Dakini's warm breath: the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-920-4}} (paperback), p.127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Denizens and pastimes of the charnel ground==
*[[Shiva]] as [[Bhairava]]
*'Outcastes' (Sanskrit: [[Chandala]]) literally cast out from the castes, outside the [[Varnashrama Dharma]] of the ''[[status quo]]''.

===Dancing===
[[File:GanpatiTibetan.jpg|thumb|left|Ganapati, Maha Rakta]]
Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent or richly different depictions of him.&lt;ref name="Nagar, p. 185"&gt;Nagar, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In one Tibetan form he is shown being trodden under foot by [[Mahakala|Mahākala]], a popular Tibetan deity.&lt;ref name="Nagar, p. 185"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getty, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, sometimes dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt; This play of Ganesha as both the "creator and remover of obstacles" as per his [[epithet]] as well in the two Vajrayana iconographic depictions of him as that which consumes (Maha Rakta) and that which is consumed (danced upon by Vignantaka) is key to the reciprocity rites of the charnel ground.

''Ganapati, Maha Rakta'' (Tibetan: tsog gi dag po, mar chen. English: The Great Red Lord of Hosts or [[Gana]]s) is a Tantric Buddhist form of Ganapati ([[Ganesha]]) related to the [[Chakrasamvara]] Cycle of Tantras. The Sanskrit term 'rakta' holds the [[semantic field]] of "blood" and "red''. This form of Ganapati is regarded as an emanation of [[Avalokiteshvara]].

"...beside a lapis lazuli rock mountain is a red lotus with eight petals, in the middle a blue rat expelling various jewels, [mounted on his rat 'steed' (Sanskrit: [[vahana]])] Shri Ganapati with a body red in colour, having an elephant face with sharp white tusks and possessing three eyes, black hair tied in a [[Sikha|topknot]] with a [[cintamani|wishing-gem]] and a red silk ribbon [all] in a bundle on the crown of the head. With twelve hands, the six right hold an axe, [[arrow]], [[ankus|hook]], [[vajra]], sword and spear. The six left [hold] a [[pestle]], bow, [[khatvanga]], [[skullcup]] filled with blood, skullcup filled with human flesh and a shield together with a spear and [[dhvaja|banner]]. The peaceful right and left hands are signified by the vajra and skullcup filled with blood held to the heart. The remaining hands are displayed in a threatening manner. Wearing various silks as a lower garment and adorned with a variety of jewel ornaments, the left foot is extended in a dancing manner, standing in the middle of the bright rays of red flickering light." ([[Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup]], 1497-1557).&lt;ref&gt;A Gift of Dharma to Kublai Khan By Chogyal Phagpa, Seventh Patriarch of Sakya. Ngorchen Konchog Lhundup, Ngor chos 'byung, folia 323?328. Translated by Jared Rhoton, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vignataka.jpg|thumb|right|Vignantaka trampling or dancing upon Vinayaka]]
This form of Ganapati belongs to a set of three powerful deities known as the 'mar chen kor sum' or the Three Great Red Deities included in a larger set called 'The Thirteen Golden Dharmas' of [[Sakya]]. The other two deities are Kurukulle and Takkiraja.

In depictions of the six-armed protector [[Mahakala]] (Skt: Shad-bhuja Mahakala, Wylie: mGon po phyag drug pa), an elephant-headed figure usually addressed as Vinayaka is seen being trampled by the Dharma Protector, but he does not appear distressed. In [[Vajrayana]] and cognate Buddhist art, He is depicted as a subdued god trampled by Buddhist deities like [[Aparajita]], [[Parnasabari]] and [[Vignataka]].

The Tibetan Ganesha appears, besides bronzes, in the resplendent Thangka paintings alongside the Buddha. In "''Ganesh, studies of an Asian God''," edited by Robert L. BROWN, State University of New York Press, 1992, page 241-242, he wrote that in the Tibetan Ka'gyur tradition, it is said that the Buddha had taught the "Ganapati Hridaya Mantra" (or "Aryaganapatimantra") to disciple [[Ananda]]. The sutra in which the Buddha teaches this mantra can be found here [http://ganesha.bravehost.com/index.html].

The [[lila (divine play)|'pastime' and 'play' (Sanskrit: ''lila'')]] of dancing and its representation in charnel ground literature and visual representations is endemic: [[Ganapati]] as son of Shiva, Ganapati as Lord of Gana, the demonic host of Gana, dancing ganesha, dancing gana, the dance of life and death, what is dance but a continuum of forms, dancing is energetic, dancing is symbolic of spiritual energy in iconography, particularly chthonic imagery of Dharmic Traditions. Energy moves (and cycles) between forms as does dance. The 'wheel' (Sanskrit: [[chakra]], [[mandala]]) in all its permutations and efflorescence is a profound Dharmic cultural artifact enshrining the energetic dance of the Universe. This is particularly applicable in the iconography of [[Nataraja]] and the 'wrathful deities' (Sanskrit: [[Heruka]]) of Vajrayana which are depicted with a flaming [[aureole]], a flaming wheel. This resonates with the deep symbolism of the mystery rite and folklore and folk custom and high culture of [[circle dance]]s which approaches a human [[cultural universal]]. [[Namkhai Norbu]], a famed [[Dzogchen]] master in the [[Bonpo]] tradition and the [[Dharmic Tradition]]s of [[esoteric Buddhism]] has revealed a number of [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]] (Tibetan) of circle dances such as the 'Dance of the [[Six Lokas]] of [[Samantabhadra]]'. The dance is a restricted initiatory rite and its process may not be disclosed as so doing would be a contravention of 'commitments ' (Sanskrit: [[samaya]]) but it may be affirmed that the rite is enacted on a colourful mandala of the [[Five Pure Lights]] and the 'central point' (Sanskrit: [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]) of the dance mandala is illuminated with a sacred candle known as the 'garbha' (Sanskrit) within the International Dzogchen Community. This terma dance is all clearly applicable to the charnel ground when taken as the 'wheel of becoming' (Sanskrit: [[bhavachakra]]) which generally is demarcated by six distinct 'places' (Sanskrit: [[loka]]).

===Aghora===
[[Dattatreya]] the [[avadhuta]], to whom has been attributed the esteemed nondual medieval song, the'' [[Avadhuta Gita]]'', was a sometime denizen of the charnel ground and a founding deity of the [[Aghor tradition]] according to Barrett (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;33):

{{Quote|...Lord Dattatreya, an antinomian form of Shiva closely associated with the [[cremation ground]], who appeared to Baba Kina Ram atop Girnar Mountain in Gujarat. Considered to be the ''adi guru'' (ancient spiritual teacher) and founding deity of Aghor, Lord Dattatreya offered his own flesh to the young ascetic as ''prasād'' (a kind of blessing), conferring upon him the power of clairvoyance and establishing a guru-disciple relationship between them.|&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008).

Barrett (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;161) discusses the sadhana of the '[[Aghori|Aghora]]' (Sanskrit; Devanagari: अघोर)&lt;ref&gt;'Aghora' in ''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' [Online]. Source: [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php] (accessed: Tuesday February 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; in both its left and right-handed proclivites and identifies it as principally cutting through attachments and aversion and foregrounding primordiality, a view uncultured, undomesticated:

{{Quote|The gurus and disciples of Aghor believe their state to be primordial and universal. They believe that all human beings are natural-born Aghori. Hari Baba has said on several occasions that human babies of all societies are without discrimination, that they will play as much in their own filth as with the toys around them. Children become progressively discriminating as they grow older and learn the culturally specific attachments and aversions of their parents. Children become increasingly aware of their mortality as they bump their heads and fall to the ground. They come to fear their mortality and then palliate this fear by finding ways to deny it altogether. In this sense, Aghor ''sādhanā'' is a process of unlearning deeply internalized cultural models. When this ''sādhanā'' takes the form of ''shmashān sādhanā'', the Aghori faces death as a very young child, simultaneously meditating on the totality of life at its two extremes. This ideal example serves as a prototype for other Aghor practices, both left and right, in ritual and in daily life.|&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008).

*[[Vetala]] (Sanskrit)
*[[Shaivites]]
*Practitioners of [[Anuyoga]]. The Anuyoga class of tantras of the Nyingmapa is understood as the "Mother Tantras" of the Sarma Schools, this class of literature is also known as "Yogini Tantras" and there is a voluminous Shaivite or Shakta Tantra by the same name, Yoginitantra.
*In the dance of reciprocity that is the beauty and cruelty of the Mystery of living and dying, the rite of [[Ganachakra]] is celebrated, indeed all forms participate in the Ganachakra, there is nothing in the Three Worlds (''[[Trailokya|Triloka]]'') that is not a charnel ground...

Beer (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;102) relates how the symbolism of the [[khatvanga]] that entered [[esoteric Buddhism]] (particularly from [[Padmasambhava]]) was a direct borrowing from the [[Shaivite]] [[Kapalika]]s who frequented places of austerity such as charnel grounds and [[Crossroads (road)|cross roads]] etcetera as a form of 'left-handed path' (Sanskrit: [[vamamarga]]) 'spiritual practice' (Sanskrit: [[sadhana]]):

{{quote|The form of the Buddhist ''khatvanga'' derived from the emblematic staff of the early Indian Shaivite ''yogins'', known as ''kapalikas'' or 'skull-bearers'. The ''kapalikas'' were originally miscreants who had been sentenced to a twelve-year term of penance for the crime of inadvertently killing a Brahmin. The penitent was prescribed to dwell in a forest hut, at a desolate crossroads, in a charnel ground, or under a tree; to live by begging; to practice austerities; and to wear a loin-cloth of hemp, dog, or donkey-skin. They also had to carry the emblems of a human skull as an alms-bowl, and the skull of the Brahmin they had slain mounted upon a wooden staff as a banner.These Hindu ''kapalika'' ascetics soon evolved into an extreme outcaste sect of the 'left-hand' tantric path (Skt. vamamarg) of ''shakti'' or goddess worship. The early Buddhist tantric ''yogins'' and ''yoginis'' adopted the same goddess or ''dakini'' attributes of the ''kapalikas''. These attributes consisted of; bone ornaments, an animal skin loincloth, marks of human ash, a skull-cup, ''damaru'', flaying knife, thighbone trumpet, and the skull-topped tantric staff or ''khatvanga''.|&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2003).

==Sadhana==
Sadhana in the charnel ground within the Dharmic Traditions may be traced to ancient depictions of the chthonic [[Shiva]] and his [[wikt:chimera|chimeric]] son [[Ganapati]] (Ganesha) who was decapitated and returned to life with the head of an elephant. In certain narratives, Shiva made the Ganesha 'lord of the [[gana]]' (Sanskrit: Ganapati). Such depictions of Shiva, Ganesha and the ganas are evident in literature, architectural ornamentation and iconography, etc. In the Indian traditions of Tantra the charnel ground is very important. In must be remembered that the seat of Shiva and his locality of sadhana is the sacred Mount [[Kailasha]] in the Himalaya. In some non-Buddhist traditions of [[Ganachakra]] such as the Kaula the leader of the rite is known as 'ganapati', which is a title of respect. The Eight Great Charnel Grounds are important in the life of [[Padmasambhava]]. This is one definite way the importance of the charnel ground in sadhana entered and became replicated in the Himalayan Dharmic Tradition. The charnel ground is a particular place that holds powerful teachings on impermanence and is important for slaying the ego. In this, the charnel ground shares with the tradition of [[dark retreat]] that was foregrounded in some Himalayan practice lineages.

[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;127) conveys how great [[Mahasiddha]]'s in the [[Nath]] and [[Mantrayana]] [[Buddhadharma]] traditions such as [[Tilopa]] (988–1069) and [[Goraksa|Gorakṣa]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 11th - 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the '[[Ground of Being (Dzogchen)|ground]]' (Sanskrit: āśraya; Wylie: gzhi)&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche and Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje (1991).

{{quote|The charnel ground is not merely the hermitage; it can also be discovered or revealed in completely terrifying mundane environments where practitioners find themselves desperate and depressed, where conventional worldly aspirations have  become devastated by grim reality. This is demonstrated in the sacred biographies of the great siddhas of the Vajrayāna tradition. Tilopa attained realization as a grinder of sesame seeds and a procurer for a prominent prostitute. Sarvabhakṣa was an extremely obese glutton, Gorakṣa was a cowherd in remote climes, Taṅtepa was addicted to gambling, and Kumbharipa was a destitute potter. These circumstances were charnel grounds because they were despised in Indian society and the siddhas were viewed as failures, marginal and defiled.|&lt;ref name="Simmer-Brown 2001 p.127"/&gt;}}

==Poetry, song, and literature==
Dyczkowski (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;26) holds that [[Hāla]]'s [[Prakrit literature]] poem the ''[[Gāthāsaptaśati]]'' (third to fifth century CE) is one of the first extant literary references to a [[Kapalika]] where in the poem the Kapalika, who is a female, anoints and besmears her body with the crematory ash from the funeral pyre of her recently deceased lover.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;Dyczkowski, Mark S. G. (1988). ''The canon of the Śaivāgama and The Kubjikā Tantras of the western Kaula tradition''. SUNY series in Kashmir Śaivism. SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-88706-494-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-494-4}} Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZIJMGo4W0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=V%C4%81m%C4%81c%C4%81ra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MfmKHrqqkl&amp;sig=gJGdk8G_oFGes6-jiv8ijNq1lk0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aDFqS_rHCdGTkAWewry2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] (accessed: Thursday February 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a literary allusion to the anointing of 'sacred ash' (Sanskrit: [[bhasma]]; [[vibhuti]]) especially associated with [[Shiva]] who applies it all over his body.

Dyczkowski (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;26) relates how [[Krishna Mishra|Kṛṣṇa Miśra]] (c 1050-1100) casts the character of a [[Kāpālika]] in his play, the '' [[Prabodhacandrodaya]]'' and then quotes verbatim a source that renders the creed of this character into English:
{{quote|"My charming ornaments are made from garlands of human skulls." says the Kāpālika, "I dwell in the cremation ground and eat my food from a human skull. I view the world alternately as separate from God ([[Ishvara|Īśvara]]) and one with Him, through the eyes that are made clear with the ointment of yoga... We (Kāpālikas) offer oblations of human flesh mixed with brains, entrails and marrow. We break our fast by drinking liquor ([[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|surā]]) from the skull of a Brahmin. At that time the god Mahābhairava should be worshipped with offerings of awe-inspiring human sacrifices from whose severed throats blood flows in currents."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;}}

In Vajrayana poetry, literature and song, particularly that of the '[[songs of realization]]', charnel grounds are often described as containing "rivers of blood", "poisonous waterfalls", and depicted as localities containing dangerous wild beasts. The [[two truths]] doctrine though iterates this view and when perceived differently, charnel grounds are peaceful places of [[beatitude|beatific]] [[solitude]] and this [[chthonic]] symbolism and the [[twilight language]] and iconography accrues a rich [[polysemy]]. When perceived differently, the charnel grounds are places of 'peace' (Sanskrit: ''shanti''), pleasant groves, populated by wildflowers and fruit. [[Songbird]]s, tame lions and tigers, and the vast open vault of the sky, fruit and flowers are often used in Vajrayana iconography and poetry and Beer (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beer|Beer, Robert]] (1999). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'', (Hardcover). Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-416-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57062-416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains their symbolism and how they are understood in the tradition in fine detail. They are all included in depictions of the charnel ground.

==Beyond social convention==
In the charnel grounds of Vajrayana, there are no [[social convention]]s to conform to and no distractions to be seduced by for the [[siddha]].&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  Dakas and [[dakini]]s gather there to celebrate ceremonial tsok 'feasts' (Sanskrit: [[ganachakra]]). The lion's roar of [[Dharma]] discourse resound as do the [[liturgy]] and the specific 'hourglass drums' (Sanskrit: [[damaru]]) of the [[chöd]]pa and the light of the inner 'joy of bliss' (Sanskrit: [[ananda]]) radiates and this dynamic movement is represented iconographically by the 'bliss-whirling' (Sanskrit: [[gankyil|ananda-chakra]]).

In his ''Manual'' on the practice of the ''[[Longchen Nyingtik]]'', [[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]] holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Right now, our minds are very fickle. Sometimes you like a certain place, and it inspires, and yet with that same place, if you stay too long, it bores you. […] As you practice more and more, one day this kind of habit, this fickle mind will just go. Then you will search for the bindu interpretation of the right place, and according to the classic tantric texts, that is usually what they call the “eight great charnel grounds”. So then, you have to go to a cemetery, especially to one of the eight cemeteries. There, under a tree, in the charnel ground, wearing a tiger skin skirt, holding a [[kapāla]] and having this indifference between relatives and enemies, indifference between food and shit, you will practise. Then your [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]] will flow. At that time, you will know how to have intercourse between emptiness and appearance."&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, from ''Longchen Nyingtik Practice Manual'' (page 66).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the life in which a [[pratyekabuddha]] attains the fruit of their 'path' (Wylie: lam), they are naturally drawn to charnel grounds. "When reflecting on the bones found there, the pratyekabuddha inquire "Where do these bones come from?"&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  This [[samyama]] (Sanskrit) on the bones awakens knowledge of their many lifetimes of investigation into the [[Twelve Nidanas|'Twelve Links of Dependent Origination']]. These twelve links then unfold in their [[mindstream]] as a 'blessing' (Sanskrit: [[adhishthana]]), in both forward and reverse sequence and on that foundation they yield 'realisation' (Sanskrit: [[siddhi]]).&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;

==Vajrayana iconography==
The charnel ground, cremation ground and cemetery is evident as a specific region within wrathful Indo-Tibetan [[sand mandala]] iconography. As the anthropologist Gold (1994: p.&amp;nbsp;141) relates in his comparative study drawn from his professional fieldwork into the symbolic universals of the sacred circles and [[sand-painting]]s of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Tibetan people]]s, parses the sacred precinct and motif of the charnel ground as a locality in the symbolic grammar of the Indo-Tibetan 'fierce yidam' or '[[wrathful deities|wrathful deity]]' (Sanskrit: [[heruka]]) sand mandala:

{{Quote|The third concentric ring [from the circumference] is optional, in that it is only used in mandalas representing the reality of deities of fierce power. It represents the charnel grounds wherein bodies are cut up and offered to birds of prey as a "sky burial." This ring signifies the cutting away of the bones and flesh of illusion on the way to the primordial ground at the mandala's center. In some mandalas, it is positioned outside of the Mountain of Fire ring.|&lt;ref name="Gold, Peter 1994 p.141"/&gt;}}

The region of the charnel grounds in many wrathful mandala often hold eight specific charnel grounds where certain key events take place in the life of [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown, Judith]] (2001). ''Dakini's warm breath: the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-920-4}} (paperback), p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vajrayana [[wrathful deities|yidam]] [[Citipati (Buddhism)|Citipati]] is said to be the Lord of Charnel Grounds.&lt;ref name="androgynylist"&gt;http://www.androgynylist.com/categories/Essence%20of%20Indistinction/sub/citipati.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood is thematic in Charnel Ground iconography where it may be understood as [[Blood|lifeblood]], a symbol of viscous 'compassion' (Sanskrit: [[Karuṇā|karuna]]) of 'sacrifice' (Sanskrit:[[yajna]]), and attendant with the symbolism of blood, bones ground our shared humanity and solidarity in the wider [[Mandala]] of life and the ancient lineage of '[[ancestors]]' from which all sentient beings are of lineal descent.

The tradition and custom of the 'sky burial' (Tibetan: ''jhator'') afforded [[Traditional Tibetan medicine]] and ''[[thangka]]'' [[iconography]] such as the '[[Tree of physiology]]' with a particular insight into the interior workings of the human body. Pieces of the [[human skeleton]] were employed in ritual tools such as the [[Kapala|skullcup]], [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]], etc.

The 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: {{IAST|aṣṭhiamudrā}}; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as "[[mudra]]" or 'seals' are also known as 'charnel ground ornaments'. The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the [[Five Wisdoms]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] in his commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' explains this further.&lt;ref name="Kongtrul_2005_493"&gt;{{harvnb|Kongtrul|2005|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The important Varnamala (or 'garland of [[Bīja|bija]] phonemes' in [[twilight language]] is iconographically represented by a 'garland of severed heads or skulls' (Sanskrit: [[Mundamala]]).

==Padmasambhava==
Beer (1999:  pp.&amp;nbsp;277–278) relates how [[Padmasambhava]] received the siddhi of the [[Kīla (Buddhism)|kīla]] [[esoteric transmission|transmission]] from a gigantic [[scorpion]] at the charnel ground of [[Rajgriha]]:

{{quote|The sting of the scorpion's whip-like tail transfixes and poisons its prey, and in this respect it is identified with the wrathful activity of the ritual dagger or kīla. Padmasambhava's biography relates how he received the siddhi of the kīla transmission at the great charnel ground of Rajgriha from a gigantic scorpion with nine heads, eighteen pincers and twenty-seven eyes. This scorpion reveals the kīla texts from a triangular stone box hidden beneath a rock in the cemetery.

[[File:Hans Memling - Allegory with a Virgin - WGA14896.jpg|thumb|right|[[Allegory]] of chastity by [[Hans Memling]]]]

'''Chastity''' is one of the [[seven virtues|seven virtues]] and it is defined as refraining from deviant [[Human sexual activity|sexual conduct]]. Chastity is usually defined within the [[morality|moral]] standards and guidelines of a culture, civilization or [[religion]]. The term is closely associated (and can be used interchangeably) with [[sexual abstinence]], especially in the context of [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chastity |title=Chastity &amp;#124; Define Chastity at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chastity |title=Chastity &amp;#124; Define Chastity at Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The words "chaste" and "chastity" stem from the [[Latin]] adjective ''castus'' ("pure"). The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century. At that time, they meant slightly different things. "Chaste" meant "virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse" (referring to [[extramarital sex]]),&lt;ref name=etymonlineChaste&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaste|title=chaste - Origin and meaning of chaste by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=podDictEtym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podictionary.com/?p=605|title=podictionary - for word lovers - daily stories, trivia &amp; dictionary etymology|author=|date=|website=podictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while "chastity" meant "virginity".&lt;ref name="podDictEtym" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=chastity|title=chastity - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the late 16th century did the two words come to have the same basic meaning as a related adjective and noun.&lt;ref name="etymonlineChaste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="podDictEtym" /&gt;

==In Abrahamic religions ==
For many Muslims and Christians, acts of sexual nature are [[fornication|restricted to marriage]]. For unmarried persons, chastity is identified with [[sexual abstinence]]. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]], and [[prostitution]], are considered [[sin]]ful.

===Christianity===
{{Redirect|Vow of chastity|vows of Catholic Religious|Evangelical counsels|vows of chastity in other Christian Churches|Religious vows}}

In many [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions, chastity is synonymous with sexual purity. Chastity means not having any sexual relations before marriage. It also means fidelity to husband or wife during marriage. In [[Catholicism|Catholic]] morality, chastity is placed opposite the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of [[lust]], and is classified as one of [[seven virtues]]. The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous. Reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[marriage]], the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship that excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. After marriage, a third form of chastity, often called "vidual chastity", is expected of a woman while she is in mourning for her late husband. For example, Anglican Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]] defined 5 rules in ''Holy Living'' (1650), including abstaining from marrying "so long as she is with child by her former husband" and "within the year of mourning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Holy Living |chapter = Chapter II, Section III, Of Chastity | author = [[Jeremy Taylor]] | year = 1650 | url = http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/taylor/holyliving/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular ethical system may not prescribe each of these. For example, Roman Catholics view sex within marriage as chaste, but prohibit the use of artificial contraception as an offense against chastity, seeing contraception as unnatural, contrary to God's will and design of human sexuality. Many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities allow for artificial contraception, seeing the restriction of family size by artificial contraception as possibly not contrary to God's will. A stricter view is held by the [[Shakers]], who prohibit marriage (and [[sexual intercourse]] under any circumstances) as a violation of chastity. The [[Catholic Church]] has set up various rules regarding [[clerical celibacy]], while most Protestant communities allow clergy to marry.

Celibacy is required of [[Christian monasticism|monastic]]s—monks, nuns and friars—even in a rare system of [[double cloister]]s, in which husbands could enter the (men's) monastery while their wives entered a (women's) sister monastery. Required celibacy among the clergy is a relatively recent practice: it became Church policy at the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139. It was not uniformly enforced among the clergy until 200 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'Reformation', Penguin Books, 2003, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Catholic priests are permitted to marry, provided they do so before ordination and outside monastic life.

''Vows of chastity'' can also be taken by laypersons, either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic [[Beguines and Beghards]] in the past) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to [[contemplation]]), or both. Some protestant religious communities, such as the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], take vows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-order/our-vows|title=Our Vows|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of chastity as part of the church membership process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voluntary aspect has led it to being included among the main [[counsels of perfection]].

Chastity is a central and pivotal concept in Roman Catholic [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]. Chastity's importance in traditional Roman Catholic teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=I. "Male and Female He Created Them . . ." |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P84.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2332}} It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Catholic life because it involves an ''apprenticeship in self-mastery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=II. The Vocation to Chastity |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P85.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2339}} By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS, not evangelical church), chastity is very important, quoting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Physical intimacy between husband and wife is a beautiful and sacred part of God's plan for His children. It is an expression of love within marriage and allows husband and wife to participate in the creation of life. God has commanded that this sacred power be expressed only between a man and a woman who are legally married. The law of chastity applies to both men and women. It includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one's spouse after marriage.

"The law of chastity requires that sexual relations be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.

"In addition to reserving sexual intimacy for marriage, we obey the law of chastity by controlling our thoughts, words, and actions. Jesus Christ taught,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:27–28)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/chastity/what-is-the-law-of-chastity?lang=eng|title=What Is the Law of Chastity?|author=|date=|website=lds.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LDS teaching also includes that sexual expression within marriage is an important dimension of spousal bonding apart from, but not necessarily avoiding its procreative result.

=== Islam ===
Chastity is mandatory in Islam. Sex outside legitimacy is prohibited, for both men and women whether married or unmarried.

The most famous personal example of chastity in the Quran is Virgin Mary (Mariam) :

"And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds." (21 :91)

'''"'''And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah ."He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"'''"''' (19:17-20)

Extramarital sex is forbidden and the Quran says:

"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (17:32)

"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." (25:68-70)

The injunctions and forbiddings in Islam apply equally to men and women. The legal punishment for adultery is equal for men and women.  Social hypocrisy in many societies over history had led to a double standard when considering sin committed by men versus sin committed by women. Society tended to be more lenient and permissive towards men forgiving men for sins not forgivable when women do them. At the root of the contemporary wave of free sex for both sexes was apparently to establish equality and remove discrimination between man and woman. Instead of calling for equal cleanliness the call was for equal dirt. Not so in Islam. and in a list of commendable deeds the Quran says:

"Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward." (33:35)

Because the sex desire is usually attained before a man is financially capable of marriage, the love to God and mindfulness of Him should be sufficient motive for chastity:

"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful." (24:33) The prophet's prescription to the youth was:

Those of you who own the means should marry for this should keep their eyes uncraving and their chastity secure. Those who don't, may practise fasting for it curbs desire. " (Ibn Massoud)

Chastity is an attitude and a way of life. In Islam it is both a personal and a social value. A Muslim society should not condone relations entailing or conducive to sexual license. Social patterns and practices bent on flaring up the sexual desire are frowned upon by Islam be the means permissive ideologies, pruritic art or neglect of moral upbringing.  Personal freedoms should never be taught as the freedom to challenge God's injunctions or trespass over the limits He drew.

===Bahá'í Faith===
Chastity is highly prized in the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Similar to other Abrahamic religions, [[Bahá'í teachings]] call for the restriction of sexual activity to that between a wife and husband in [[Bahá'í marriage]], and discourage members from using pornography or engaging in sexually explicit recreational activities. The concept of chastity is extended to include avoidance of alcohol and mind-altering drugs, profanity, and gaudy or immoderate attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compilation of Compilations (Volume 1)|last=Research Department|first=Universal House of Justice|publisher=Baha'i Publications Australia|year=1991|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=|chapter=A Chaste and Holy Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Eastern religions ==

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]]'s view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of [[Ashrama (stage)]] or the stages of life. The first of these stages, known as ''[[Brahmacharya]],'' roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy and chastity are considered the appropriate behavior for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[student]]s during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder ([[Grihastha]]). [[Sanyasa|Sanyasis]] and Hindu monks or [[Sadhu]]s are also celibate as part of their [[asceticism|ascetic]] discipline.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], premarital or extra-marital sex is strictly forbidden. However, it is encouraged to marry and live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation (as opposed to sannyasa or living as a monk, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India). A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.

=== Jainism ===
Celibacy is a must for all [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks and nuns]]. Chastity (Bhramacharya) is one of the five major vows of [[Jainism]]. The general Jain code of [[ethics]] requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity.

===Buddhism===
The teachings of [[Buddhism]] include the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], comprising a division called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|right action]]. Under the [[Five Precepts]] ethical code, [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā]] lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while [[Bhikkhu]] and [[Bhikkhuni]] monastics should practice strict chastity.

=== Daoism ===
The [[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]]  of the [[Daoist]] religion include No Sexual Misconduct, which is interpreted as prohibiting extramarital sex for lay practitioners and marriage or sexual intercourse for monks and nuns.

'''Chinese Whispers''' is a clustering method used in network science named after the famous [[Chinese whispers|whispering game]].&lt;ref name= "Biemann2006"&gt;Chris Biemann,[http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~cbiemann/pub/2006/BiemannTextGraph06.pdf "Chinese Whispers- an Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm and its Applications to Natural Language Processing Problems"], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Clustering methods are basically used to identify communities of nodes or links in a given network. This algorithm was designed by [[Chris Biemann]] and [[Sven Teresniak]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt; The name comes from the fact that the process can be modeled as a separation of communities where the nodes send the same type of information to each other.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

Chinese Whispers is a hard partitioning, randomized, flat clustering (no [[hierarchical clustering|hierarchical relations between clusters]]) method.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt; The random property means that running the process on the same network several times can lead to different results, while because of hard partitioning one node can only belong to one cluster at a given moment.  The original algorithm is applicable to undirected, weighted and unweighted graphs. Chinese Whispers is time linear which means that it is extremely fast even if the number of nodes and links are very high in the network.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

==Algorithm==
[[File:Chinese Whispers example cluster.png|thumb|right|An example of how Chinese Whispers works in action. The different colors represent different classes.]]

The algorithm works in the following way in an undirected unweighted graph:&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;
# All nodes are assigned to a random class. The number of initial classes equals the number of nodes.
# Then all of the network nodes are selected one by one in a random order. Every node moves to the class which the given node connects with the most links. In the case of equality the cluster is randomly chosen from the equally linked classes.
# Step two repeats itself until a predetermined number of iteration or until the process converges. In the end the emerging classes represent the clusters of the network.

The predetermined threshold for the number of the iterations is needed because it is possible that process does not converge. On the other hand in a network with approximately 10000 nodes the clusters does not change significantly after 40-50 iterations even if there is no convergence.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

==Strengths and Weaknesses==

The main strength of Chinese Whispers lies in its time linear property. Because of the processing time increases linearly with the number of nodes, the algorithm is capable of identifying communities in a network very fast. For this reason Chinese Whispers is a good tool to analyze community structures in graph with a very high number of nodes. The effectiveness of the method increases further if the network has the [[Small-world experiment|small world property]].&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

On the other hand because the algorithm is not deterministic in the case of small node number the resulting clusters often significantly differ from each other. The reason for this is that in the case of a small network it matters more from which node the iteration process starts while in large networks the relevance of starting points disappears.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt; For this reason for small graphs other clustering methods are recommended.

==Applications==

Chinese Whispers is used in many subfield of network science. Most frequently it is mentioned in the context of [[Natural Language Processing]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Di Marco - Roberto Navigili,[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00148#.VW4sDc_tmko "Clustering and Diversifying Web Search Results with Graph Based Word Sense Induction"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Korkontzelos - Suresh Manandhar,[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P09-2017 "Detecting Compositionality in Multi-Word Expressions"], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the algorithm is applicable to any kind of community identification problem which is related to a network framework. Chinese Whispers is available for personal use as an extension package for [[Gephi]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/chinese-whispers-clustering/ "Gephi Marketplace" ]&lt;/ref&gt; which is an [[Open-source software|open source]] program designed for network analysis.

G. |last1=Green |citeseerx=10.1.1.32.8003|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.32.8003}}&lt;/ref&gt; are design principles for [[notation]]s, [[user interface]]s and [[programming language]]s, described by researchers [[Thomas R.G. Green]] and [[Marian Petre]].  The dimensions can be used to evaluate the [[usability]] of an existing ''information artifact'', or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one.

Cognitive dimensions are designed to provide a lightweight approach to analyse the quality of a design, rather than an in-depth, detailed description.  They provide a common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation, UI or programming language design.  Also, cognitive dimensions help in exploring the space of possible designs through ''design maneuvers'', changes intended to improve the design along one dimension.

==List of the cognitive dimensions==
Thomas Green originally defined 14 cognitive dimensions:

; Abstraction gradient : What are the minimum and maximum [[Abstraction (computer science)#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] exposed by the notation? Can details be [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulated]]?

; Closeness of mapping : How closely does the notation correspond to the [[Problem domain|problem]] world?

; Consistency : After part of the notation has been [[Learnability|learned]], how much of the rest can be successfully guessed?

; Diffuseness / terseness : How many [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]]s or how much space does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]?

; Error-proneness : To what extent does the notation influence the likelihood of [[user error|the user making a mistake]]?

; Hard mental operations : How much [[mental effort|hard mental processing]] lies at the notational level, rather than at the [[semantic]] level? Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?

; Hidden dependencies : Are [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]] between entities in the notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to unexpected consequences?

; Juxtaposability : Can different parts of the notation be compared side-by-side at the same time?

; Premature commitment : Are there strong constraints on the order in which the user must complete the tasks to use the system?

:Are there decisions that must be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those decisions be reversed or corrected later?

; Progressive evaluation : How easy is it to evaluate and obtain [[feedback]] on an incomplete solution?

; Role-expressiveness : How obvious is the [[Role (computer science)|role]] of each component of the notation in the solution as a whole?

; Secondary notation and escape from formalism : Can the notation carry extra information [[Secondary notation|by means not related to syntax]], such as layout, color, or other cues?

; Viscosity
: Are there in the notation any inherent barriers to change? How much effort is required to make a change to a program expressed in the notation?
: This dimension can be further classified into the following types:&lt;ref&gt;[http://acm.org/sigchi/chi96/proceedings/shortpap/Wilde/wn_txt.html Using Cognitive Dimensions in the Classroom as a Discussion Tool for Visual Language Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 'Knock-on viscosity' : a change in the code violates internal constraints in the program, whose resolution may violate further internal constraints.
:* 'Repetition viscosity' : a single action within the user’s conceptual model requires many, repetitive device actions.
:* 'Scope viscosity' : a change in the size of the input data set requires changes to the program structure itself.

; Visibility : How readily can required parts of the notation be identified, accessed and made visible?

===Other dimensions===
In addition to the above, new dimensions are sometimes proposed in the HCI research field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dealing with New Cognitive Dimensions | citeseerx=10.1.1.18.7947 | first1 = Alan F. | last1 = Blackwell | author-link = Alan F. Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; with different levels of adoption and refinement.

Some of these candidate dimensions include creative ambiguity (does the notation encourage interpreting several meanings of the same element?), indexing (are there elements to guide finding a specific part?), synopsis ("[[Gestalt psychology#Properties|gestalt view]]" of the whole annotated structure) or unevenness (some creation paths are easier than others, which bias the expressed ideas in a developed artifact).

== User activities ==
The authors identify four main user activities with interactive artifacts: ''incrementation'' [creation], ''transcription'', ''modification'' and ''exploratory design''. Each activity is best served by a different trade-off in the usability on each dimension. For example, a high viscosity (resistance to change) is harmful for modification and exploration activities, but less severe for the one-off tasks performed in transcription and incrementation.

== Design maneuvers ==
A '''design maneuver''' is a change made by the designer in the notation design, to alter its position within a particular dimension. Dimensions are created to be pairwise independent, so that the design can be altered in one dimension while keeping a second one constant.

But this usually results in a trade-off between dimensions. A modification increasing the usability of the notation in one dimension (while keeping a second one constant) will typically reduce its usability in a third dimension. This reflects an assumption in the framework that there is no perfect interface and that trade-offs are a fundamental part of usability design.

An example of a design maneuver is reducing the viscosity of a notation by adding abstraction mechanisms. This can be done by incorporating [[Style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]], an abstraction that represent the common styling attributes of items in a document, to a notation where each item in a document has defined its own individual style. After this design maneuver is made, an editor that changes the style sheet will modify all items at once, eliminating the ''repetition viscosity'' present in the need to change the style of each individual item.

'''Dhi''' (Sanskrit: धी), this [[Sanskrit]] word means 'understanding', 'reflection', 'religious thought', 'mind', 'design', 'intelligence', 'opinion', 'meditation', 'imagination', 'notion', 'intellect',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=dhi+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is directly connected with the word, [[Vāc]] (Sanskrit: वाच) meaning Speech, derived from Vac (Sanskrit: वच) meaning, 'to speak'. ''Dhi'' is the voiced ''Vāc'' or '[[Speech]]', it is the thought-mind or intellect. ''Dhi'' also means 'to hold' or 'to place', and indicates the activity of the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Symbolism|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iR1L8V8bxqgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The natural meaning of ''Dhi'' is '[[Thought]]' which corresponds to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Buddhi]]'' which means 'the activity of mind', 'thought', 'understanding' and 'intelligence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hymns to the Mystic Fire|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuOFGN8s4s0C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-V7NUvuqMYmShgeT7YGACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic Sanskrit]] employs two words ''Dhi'' and [[Brahman]] for prayerful or meditative contemplation in which context ''Dhi'' means 'visionary insight', 'intense thought and reflection', and the word Brahman is derived from the root ''brh'', meaning 'to grow', 'to expand'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana|author=Ian Whicher|publisher=SUNY Press|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u1_NUtTwBdKShgfKjYDQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Manu Smriti]] describes ten essential rules for observance of [[Dharma]] (the path of righteousness or the 'Law of Being', which binds the people of this world and the whole creation) – ''Dhriti'' ('patience'), ''[[Kshama]]'' ('forgiveness'), ''Dama'' ('self-control'), ''[[Asteya]]'' ('honesty'), ''Shauch'' ('purity'), ''Indriya-nigrah'' ('control of senses'), ''Dhi'' ('reasoning'), ''Vidya'' ('knowledge and learning'), ''[[Satya]]'' ('truthfulness') and ''[[Akrodha]]'' ('control of anger').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basics of Hinduism|author=Shivendra Kumar Sinha|publisher=Unicorn Books|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSOEETzRVqsC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

'''Dhi''', the prefix of ''Dhimahi'' and ''Dhiyo'' occurring in the [[Gayatri Mantra]] ([[Rig Veda]]III.62.10) refers to 'understanding', and its cognate word ''Buddhi'' means 'reasoning faculty of the mind', which understanding must be transcended to experience the Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction|author=M.Ram Murty|publisher=Broadview Press|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chQjTOdnlLIC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, ''Dhira'', meaning 'calm', denotes the seeker whose intellect is saturated in knowledge which word is the combination of ''Dhi'' meaning 'intellect' and ''ra'' meaning 'fire' or 'wisdom'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jnana Sankalini Tantra|author=Paramhansa Prjnananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq-LDHAYbzAC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Non-Atman i.e. the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]], which is by its nature disagreeable, is the object of the function of ''Dhi'' (=''buddhi'') which reveals the joy (''ananda''), the nature of the individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Yajnavalkya’s – Maitreyi Dialogue|author=Suresvaracharya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvcrBnKaIgEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2DNUt3nGIm7hAep9IDYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Patanjali]] defines [[Yoga]] as neutralization of the alternating waves in consciousness; in the phrase ''citta vritti nirodha'' (Yoga Sutra I.2), ''[[Citta]]'' refers to the 'thinking principle' and includes 'pranic life forces', to ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]'' ('mind' or 'sense consciousness'), ''[[Ahamkara]]'' ('egoity') and ''[[Buddhi]]'' ('intuitive intelligence'), and ''[[Vritti]]'' refers to the waves of thought and emotion that ceaselessly arise and [[Nirodha]] refers to 'neutralization', 'cessation' or 'control'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Sri Paramhansa Yogananda|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsIi4ePN4hYC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2DNUt3nGIm7hAep9IDYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root ''budh'' and its derivatives appear in the [[Vedas]] in the sense of 'kindling' or 'awakening', the word ''buddhi'' appears for the first time in ''Samkhyayana Brahmana Upanishad''. ''Dhi'' is derived from ''dhriti'' and its cognate ''didhiti'', it also refers to flash of intuition which is beyond all purely sensuous perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Spirituality Vedas Through Vedanta|author=Krishna Sivaraman|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=192,210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lktl97WdxWkC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental organs are ''manas'' ('mind') and ''hrd'' ('heart'), and the mental faculties are ''citta'' ('thought'), ''dhi'' ('mental vision') and ''kratu'' ('mental power'). ''Manas'' is said to perform the processes indicated by the verbal roots '''cit-'', ''dhi-'' and ''man-''; ''dhi'' requires ''kratu'' in actualizing visions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Indian Psychology|author=N.Ross Reat|publisher=Jain Publishing Co.|pages=96–135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0nHmSni1NEC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmLNUq71OJGrhAfKuYCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with Vāc==

'''Dhi''' refers to 'vision' or 'inspiration which is the exceptional faculty of acquiring a sudden knowledge of transcendent truth or reality', 'the inner light of visionary insight'. [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] is the Lord of Vision who dispenses inspiration and Speech (Vāc) is inspired thought (''manisa'') or wisdom guarded by the seers on the seat of ''[[Rta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Literature (Samhitas and Brahmanas)|author=Jan Gonda|publisher=Otto Harrasowitz Veriag|pages=66–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ogb24XeQOZ8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rig Veda]] links language not only to thought (''manas'') but also to vision (''dhi''), a word from which comes ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' meaning 'meditation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|author=Frits Staal|publisher=Penguin Books|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Yajurveda]] (29.8), [[Sarasvati]], the Goddess of Speech, is invoked to grant the gift of ''Dhi'', inspired thought, and thought is linked with ''Vāc''; [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] is also known as the river of inspired thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvati, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge|author=Catherine Ludvik|publisher=BRILL|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsYKIXBOK0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmLNUq71OJGrhAfKuYCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedas]] are the sacred texts of the [[Hindus]]. They are the repository of what is the known or required to be known, in other words, the true knowledge or the transcendent eternal wisdom articulated in [[Sound]] ('sabda') or [[Speech]] ('vāc'). The [[Vedic]] [[Rishi|seers]] have associated the power of speech or the spoken word with ultimacy and transcendence – ''ekam sat'' ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.46). They also know [[Vishwakarma]], the creator, as Vācaspati, the Lord of Speech ([[Rig Veda]] X.81.7) (who is also called [[Brihaspati]] and Brahmanaspati), and that Vāc or speech or utterance as [[Brahman]] is the creative principle and the absolute force in the universe; the person who has gained its knowledge is said to have attained the highest knowledge ([[Rig Veda]] X.125.5). As far as Brahman extends so far does ''Vāc'' ([[Rig Veda]] X.114.8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion|author=William A.graham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX0T-ZqTcC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Vāc==

The Inspired thought (''dhi'') that precedes utterance though connected with speech undergoes some modifications while being transformed into speech; the [[Vedic]] [[Rishis]] tell us that the thoughtful one's produce speech with their mind ([[Rig Veda]] X.71.2), the different stages in transformation from ''dhi'' to ''vāc'' are described in the [[Atharvaveda]] (VII.1.1). ''Dhi'' is the voiced speech. Goddess Saraswati presides over speech but ''vāc'' extends far above and beyond Saraswati ([[Rig Veda]] X.125) beyond all known spheres ([[Rig Veda]] X.114.8). Vāc is dependent on breath or air; and the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (IV.42.1) states ''Brahman vai vāk'', Vāc is the mother of the Vedas and the Vedas themselves ([[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (6.5.3.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvati, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge|author=Catherine Ludvik|publisher=BRILL|pages=33, 37, 60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsYKIXBOK0C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Vedas are a form of the ritual and cosmological ''Vāc'' (speech). Vāc is presented as consort of [[Prajapati]] (Kathaka Samhita 12.5.27.1) whom the Brahmanas  express as 'the expressed' (''nirukta'') and as the 'unexpressed' (''anirukta''), the limited and the unlimited. [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] tells us that Vāc is the imperishable one, the (''[[Aksara]]''), the first-born of the cosmic order (''[[Rta]]''), the mother of the Vedas (''vedanam mata''), the navel of immortality (''[[Amrita]]'') and therefore Vedas themselves are infinite (''[[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]''), immortal (''amrta'') and imperishable (''akshita''). The ''Jaiminiya Upanishad'' tells us that [[Om|Aum]] or Om, the essence of all essences, is [[Vāc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Authority, Anxiety, and Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation|author=Barbara A.Holdrege|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=2, 40, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8CGJBo3z4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the human plane the mind precedes speech, and on the cosmic plane Prajapati precedes ''vāc'' as the Lord of Thought and Speech, who brings forth ''vāc'' to unite with ''vāc'' to manifest creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture|author= Barbara A.Holdrege|publisher=SUNY Press|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_H31Q_eq84C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Vāc'' was probably the language commonly spoken by the Vedic people as the language of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Style of the Vedic Rishis|author=Tatayana Elizarenkova|publisher=SUNY Press|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-B0Y-IwTQAC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vāc'' is another name for [[Aditi]] or [[Viraj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indus Script and the Rg-veda|author=Egbert Richter-Ushanas|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DZYbWQbKAsC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of invoking [[Agni]] and other ''[[Devatas (Vedanta)|devatas]]'', the [[mantra]]s of the [[Rig Veda]] have a very essential role to play because the ''Upasaka'' when meditating is required to think of the Rcs as Vāc i.e. speech; it is for this reason that the mantras are chanted and there is a prescribed way to do that chanting. Rishi [[Medhātithi|Medhatithi Kanva]] ([[Rig Veda]] I.12.11) prays:

:स नः सत्वान आ भर गायत्रेन नवीयसा |
:रयिं वीरवतिमिषम् ||

"May Agni accept the words of praise (adoration) set in newer hymns composed in Gayatri metre and devoutly sung (chanted), (May Agni) accept the oblations made in it (in the prescribed manner) of the offerings rightly earned and belonging to the performers of rites." And, Rishi Ayasya (Rig Veda IX.46.2) praying thus-

:परिष्कृतास इन्दवो योषेव पित्र्यावती |
:वायुं सोमा असृक्षत ||

informs us that having acquired the knowledge of the highest the learned people (easily) unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. This means, that each experience of ours is a re-discovery of ourselves, and that in order to really re-discover ourselves so as to understand our true nature we have to firstly awaken our mind, then make the mind speak loudly enough to be heard because [[Prana]], which is the body of the mind, is that very silence waiting to be heard. A sage of the Rig Veda (Rig Veda X.20.9) states that the creator vested ''[[Agni]]'' with three coloured flames and made it brilliant, eminent, swift-acting and hot. The sage of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] tells us that behind all things are these three colours, the rest constituted out of them are a modification and a name. Speech is Rk or ''[[Brhati]]'' identified with ''[[Prana]]'' whose lord is [[Brihaspati]], the same lord is Brahmanaspati when speech is ''[[Yajus]]'' associated with Brahman. Speech is ''Sama''; it cannot reveal itself for it is as formless as the air on which it rides; it rides upon the streams of air constituting the wind, and words once uttered do not return to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=47, 77, 62, 87, 93|url=https://www.amazon.in/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Ravinder%20Kumar%20Soni&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A976389031%2Cp_27%3ARavinder%20Kumar%20Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yajnavalkya]] tells King [[Janaka]] that the light that comes nearest to the supreme light of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is the light of Vāc i.e. speech, since it is the supreme faculty of reason that finally lifts the consciousness towards the pure self-shining awareness of the Atman, and which after serving as a pointer vanishes or goes to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Upanishads Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranad|publisher=-Sarup and Sons|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=vac+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kwXNUraJJZGThQfFwIGABw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic sages have all along advocated 'Truth', 'Penance' and 'Study' as special virtues. Amongst these three special virtues Truth is held out to be the supreme virtue to be practised by all aspirants. All primary virtues are firstly imbibed from the parents; [[Satyakama Jabala]] acquired the spirit of truthfulness from his mother, and [[Sanat Kumara]] taught [[Narada]] that Truth has to be sought for realization – "when one indeed understands Truth in its reality one speaks the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of True Happiness|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=Soni Parivar|page=14|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While describing the rituals associated with the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]], in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] we are told that the neighing of the horse, representing the cosmos, is Vāc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Indian Tradition|author=Stephen N.Hay|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBWzV-TRXzkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=vac+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kwXNUraJJZGThQfFwIGABw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claim for primacy==

A sage of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] after declaring that the syllable ''[[Om|Aum]]'', having the individual and also the cosmic efficacy, not only serves to help the meditation of the individual person but even the Sun travels the universe singing ''Aum'' as does ''Prana'' moving in the body (Ch.Up.I.5.1,3) explains that that ''[[Om|Aum]]'' is the essence of all beings on this earth, the essence of a person is speech and the essence of speech is the [[Rig Veda]] (Ch.Up.I.1.2) but the essence of [[Samaveda]], which is the essence of the Rig Veda, is ''[[Om|Udgitha]]'' which is ''Aum''. He declares that all speech is interwoven on the symbol ''Aum'', in the same manner as the leaves of a tree are woven together on a stalk (Ch.Up.II.23.3). Speech is the fuel of fire which is man (Ch.Up.V.7.1). Mind consists of 'food', the Prana consists of 'water' and speech consists of 'fire' (Ch.Up.VI.6.5). [[Narada]] is told by [[Sanat Kumara]] that all this is but a name by which one knows, even then speech is greater than name because if there is no speech neither righteousness nor unrighteousness would be known, but surely the mind is greater than speech for mind  is the entire world (Ch.Up.VII.2 &amp; 3) establishing the claim of the mind (''dhi'') for primacy over speech (''vāc'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=83, 214, 245|url=https://archive.org/stream/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drake Landing Solar Community''' (DLSC) is a [[planned community]] in [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], equipped with a [[central solar heating]] system and other energy efficient technology. This heating system is the first of its kind in North America, although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe. The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year-round heating by underground [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlsc.ca/ |title=Drake Landing Solar Community |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was designed to model a way of addressing [[global warming]] and the burning of [[fossil fuels]]. The solar energy is captured by 800 [[solar thermal collector]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/c3-views/september-2007/case-study-drake-landing-shines-solar|title=Case Study: Drake Landing|author=Climate Change Central|accessdate=2007-02-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516001141/http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/c3-views/september-2007/case-study-drake-landing-shines-solar|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located on the roofs of all 52 houses' garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media/newsreleases/2007/200784_e.htm |title=Unique Community a Model for a Greener, Healthier Canada |author=Natural Resources Canada |authorlink=Natural Resources Canada |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023111/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media/newsreleases/2007/200784_e.htm |archivedate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okotoks.ca/sustainable/Energy/northamericafirst.asp |title=North America's First Solar Powered Subdivision - Drake Landing |publisher=[[Okotoks|Town of Okotoks]] |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103002142/http://www.okotoks.ca/sustainable/Energy/northamericafirst.asp |archivedate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources.

In 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97%; that is, providing that amount of the community's heating requirements with solar energy over a one-year time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Natural Resources Canada|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media-room/news-release/2012/6586|title=Canadian Solar Community Sets New World Record for Energy Efficiency and Innovation|date= 5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong |first1=B.|last2= Thornton |first2=J. |year=2013|url=http://www.geo-exchange.ca/en/UserAttachments/flex1304_5-%20SAIC-%20Bill%20Wong%202013%20-%20Integrating%20Solar%20and%20Heat%20Pumps.pdf|format=PDF|title=Integrating Solar &amp; Heat Pumps|website= Presentation at Renewable Heat Workshop|accessdate= 31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==

There are 52 homes in this subdivision that contain an array of 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes. During a typical summer day these collectors can generate 1.5 mega-[[watt]]s of [[Solar water heating|thermal power]]. A [[glycol]] solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated piping underground through a trench system to the [[heat exchanger]] within the community’s Energy Centre. This is known as the Solar Collector Loop. The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District Heating Loop begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50&amp;nbsp;°C within the Energy Centre. This lower temperature is more energy efficient, as solar collecting is more compatible with lower temperatures. This increases the total amount of heat available to each home.

In the warmer months the previously heated water is taken from the short-term storage tank to the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES). The Borehole Thermal Energy Storage unit is 144 holes located {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the ground and stretches over an approximate area of {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. The water returns to the short-term storage tanks in the Energy Centre to be heated again in order to complete the circuit. During colder months the water from the BTES passes back to the short-term storage tank and is then directed to each home. Similar to a [[Hot water storage tank|hot water tank]], the heated water goes through a heat exchanger that blows air across the warm fan coil. Heat travels from the water to the air and is directed through the house via ductwork. When the temperature reaches that said on the thermostat, an automatic valve shuts off the heat transfer unit.&lt;ref name="dlsc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlsc.ca/|title=Drake Landing Solar Community|work=dlsc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy centre ==

The Energy Centre building is a 232 square metre (2,500 square feet) building which began operation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/bjul15/DLSC_SHC_2012_final.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to the short-term storage tanks and most mechanical equipment such as pumps, heat exchangers, and controls. The Solar Collector Loop, the District Heating Loop, and the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage Loop pass through the Energy Centre. Two horizontal water tanks occupy the majority of the space within the Energy Centre. These tanks are {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length. The remaining space within the Energy Centre houses pumps, valves, heat exchangers and other necessary equipment to operate and control the energy system. These tanks are known as [[Energy storage#Short-term thermal storage.2C as heat or cold|Short-Term Thermal Storage]] (STTS).&lt;ref name="dlsc" /&gt;

== Borehole thermal energy system ==

The Borehole Thermal Energy System is located underground to store large quantities of heat collected in the summer to be used in the winter. It consists of 144 [[boreholes]], which stretch to a depth of {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At the surface the pipes are joined together in groups of six to connect to the Energy Centre. The entire BTES is covered by a layer of insulation, on top of which a park is built. When the heated water is to be stored, it is pumped through the pipe series. The heat is then transferred to the surrounding soil as the water cools and returns to the Energy Centre. When the homes need heat, water flows to the centre of the BTES field and picks up the heat from the surrounding soil. The heated water then goes to the short-term energy tank in the Energy Centre and is pumped through the District Heating Loop to the homes.&lt;ref name="dlsc" /&gt;

== Sponsors and partners ==

This project was conceived by [[Natural Resources Canada]]’s CanmetENERGY in partnership with governmental organizations and Canadian industries. Of the $7 million needed for this project this was the breakdown of funds: 
*$2 million from federal government agencies.
*$2.9 million from the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] and Green Municipal Investment Fund. 
*$625,000 from the Alberta Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pubs/DrakesLanding(ENG).pdf|title=CanmetENERGY|work=nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community members ==

Homeowners were willing to pay for these energy efficient homes because it ensured high quality construction. Until the solar heating system began working, [[ATCO]] Gas (an Alberta-based natural gas distribution company) fixed heating costs at $60 per month for the homeowners at the Drake Landing Solar Community.  With rising fuel costs, this was a powerful incentive for homeowners to support the DLSC project. Even if the project had failed, ATCO Gas would have replaced the special hot-water furnaces with traditional natural gas ones. There was limited risk to the homeowners and this encouraged them to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/1696/1/Wamboldt_Jason_M_200901_Master.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local sustainability ==

The 52 homes in Drake Landing Solar Community are certified to Natural Resource Canada’s [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] Standard as well as the Built Green™ Alberta Gold Standard.

== Costs and financing ==

*Each house sold for an average of $380,000.
*Homeowners are receiving an average of $60 per month solar utility bill for heating.
*$7 million for the initial start up of the Drake Landing Solar Community project.
*If this project were repeated it would cost $4 million, as approximately $3 million was for one-time research and development.
*Optimal community size would be 200-300 homes to realize the economies of scale. The number of systems would remain the same; only the number of boreholes would need to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pubs/DrakesLanding(ENG).pdf.|title=CanmetENERGY|work=nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International effects ==

A group of researchers from South Korea visited Drake Landing Solar Community in April 2012 to study the geothermal heating technology and how it can be applied to communities in South Korea, particularly ahead of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]]. The main focus of this research trip was to learn about the economics and reliability of the technology.&lt;ref name="westernwheel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernwheel.com/article/20120425/WHE0801/304259996/-1/whe/korean-researchers-learn-from-drake-landing|title=Korean researchers learn from Drake Landing|work=Okotoks Western Wheel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==

On October 5, 2012 the DLSC set a new world record by covering 97% of space heating needs with solar thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2012/2012/kw41/canadian-drake-landing-community-sets-world-record-for-solar-heating.html|title=Canadian Drake Landing community sets world record for solar heating|work=solarserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015-2016 heating season, 100% of space heating needs were met with solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlsc.ca/ Accessed on June 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6187">'''Dualism in Indian philosophy''' refers to the belief held by certain schools of [[Indian philosophy]] that reality is fundamentally composed of two parts. This mainly takes the form of either mind-matter dualism in [[Buddhist philosophy]] or consciousness-matter dualism in the [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. These can be contrasted with [[mind-body dualism]] in Western [[philosophy of mind]], but also have similarities with it.

Another form of dualism in Hindu philosophy is found in the [[Dvaita]] ("dualism") [[Vedanta]] school, which regards God and the world as two realities with distinct essences; this is a form of [[theistic dualism]]. By contrast, schools such as [[Advaita]] ("nondualism") Vedanta embrace absolute [[monism]] and regard dualism as an illusion (''[[Maya (religion)|maya]]'').

==Buddhist philosophy==
[[File:Dharmakirti.gif|thumb|150 px|right|Dharmakīrti, a key theorist of [[Buddhist atomism]].]]
During the classical era of [[Buddhist philosophy]] in India, philosophers such as [[Dharmakirti]] argued for a dualism between states of consciousness and [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atoms]] (the basic building blocks that make up reality), according to the "standard interpretation" of Dharmakirti's Buddhist [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges B.J. Dreyfus, ''Recognizing Reality'', SUNY Press 1996 ({{ISBN|978-0791430989}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samkhya and Yogic philosophy==
While [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical traditions]], as exemplified by Descartes, equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism; some [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophies]] provide an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to [[substance dualism]], by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter — where matter includes both body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], two of the six orthodox ([[āstika]]) schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], "there are two irreducible, innate and independent realities: 1) [[consciousness]] itself ([[Purusha]]), and 2) primordial materiality ([[Prakriti]])".{{cn|date=December 2017}} The unconscious primordial materiality, Prakriti, contains 23 components including intellect ([[buddhi]], mahat), ego ([[ahamkara]]) and mind ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]). Therefore, the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. Consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness creates thought structures that appear to be conscious.&lt;ref name="page342"&gt;Isaac, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.&lt;ref name="page342"/&gt;

By including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya-Yoga avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws.{{according to|date=December 2017}} Because mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dvaita philosophy==
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D.

'''Dunja Mijatović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Дуња Мијатовић}}; born 8 September 1964 Bosnia and Herzegovina) is the current Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. She was elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 24 January 2018 and took up her function on 1 April 2018.

She is an expert on [[media law]] and [[media regulation]], who from 2010 to 2016 served as the [[OSCE]] [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media|Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFoM)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6941&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=8|title=Dunja Mijatović elected Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.assembly.coe.int|archive-url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6941&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=8|archive-date=2018-01-25|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Dunja Mijatović is the daughter of [[Tatjana Ljujić-Mijatović]], former [[Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serb member]] of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Having studied in a variety of countries, Mijatović earned her B.Sc. at the [[University of Sarajevo]] in 1987, after which point she pursued a joint M.A. in [[European studies]] at the [[University of Sarajevo]], [[University of Sussex]], [[University of Bologna]] and [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.osce.org/fom/158981?download=true CV], OSCE RFoM&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her studies in 2002 with a Master’s thesis on ''The Internet and Freedom of Expression''.

Mijatović is a native speaker of [[Serbo-Croatian]], fluent in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] and has working knowledge in [[French language|French]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

==Career==
Throughout her career, Mijatović has been engaged in media issues across a multitude of disciplines, with substantial experience in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as well as [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] settings. As early as 1998, as one of the founders of the BiH Communications Regulatory Agency, she helped create a legal, regulatory and policy framework for the media in a complex post-war society.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; She was also involved in setting up a self-regulatory press council and the first free media helpline in Southeast Europe.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/speak_up/conference_speakers.pdf Short Bio], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Mijatović was elected Chair of the [[European Platform of Regulatory Agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epra.org  EPRA]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first non-EU Member State representative and the first woman to hold this post. Previously, she chaired the [[Council of Europe]]'s Group of Specialists on Freedom of Expression and Information in Times of Crisis. During her chairmanship, the CoE Committee of Ministers adopted the Declaration by the Committee of Ministers on the “Protection and promotion of investigative journalism” and “Guidelines on protecting freedom of expression and information in times of crisis.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscebih.org/documents/osce_bih_doc_2011021323525122eng.pdf CV], OSCE BiH&lt;/ref&gt;
As an expert on media and [[communications law|communications legislation]], she has worked in a number of countries.

In addition, the Representative has served as a [[lecturer]] both in her home country and abroad. Among other teaching positions, since 2000 she has lectured on media regulation at the Universities of Sarajevo and Banja Luka, the Academy for Political Excellence (2007-2009) and since 2008 has been a permanent lecturer on Media, Security and Hate Crime, a joint OSCE and Ministry of Security project.

In 2010 Mijatović succeeded [[Miklós Haraszti]] as the OSCE [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media|Representative on Freedom of the Media (RfoM)]]. She has aimed to fulfill her mandate as [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osce.org/pc/40131 Decision No. 193 of the Permanent Council of the OSCE, “Establishment of the Office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media, Mandate of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media] on November 5th, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pursuant to this decision, Mijatović holds the role of observing relevant media developments in OSCE participating States and, advocating and promoting full compliance with OSCE principles and commitments with respect to freedom of expression and free media and providing early warnings and rapid responses for resolution in cases of non-compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osce.org/fom/43207 OSCE RFoM]&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2013 she was reappointed for a second three-year term as OSCE RFoM Representative.

'''Dysteleology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that [[existence]] has no ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' - no [[Four causes|final cause]] from purposeful [[design]]. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) invented and popularized the word "dysteleology"&lt;ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Federal Trade Commission v. Dean Foods Company}}
'''''FTC v. Dean Foods Co.''''', 384 U.S. 597 (1966), is a 1966 decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] holding that the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) may sue in federal court to obtain a [[preliminary injunction]] to maintain the status quo against the consummation of a merger that the agency persuasively contends violates the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=FTC v. Dean Foods Co.|384|597|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the ''Dean Foods'' case stands for the proposition that a federal agency may, by invoking the "[[All Writs Act]]," seek equitable relief in federal court against a person's threatened action that will substantially interfere with the agency's performance of its statutory duty and thus adversely affect the relevant court's ability to review the agency's ultimate order with respect to the threatened action.

==Facts==
[[Dean Foods]] and Bowman Dairy, two substantial competitors in the sale of milk in the Chicago area, agreed to a merger. Dean was the second largest firm and Bowman the third or fourth, and together they accounted for 23% of milk sales in the area.&lt;ref&gt;See 384 U.S. at 602 ("[A]t the time of the merger, Dean was the third or fourth largest distributor of packaged milk in the Chicago area; Bowman was at least the second largest in that market, and together they enjoyed approximately 23% of the sales of packaged milk in the same area, while the four largest dairy companies had a 43% share thereof.").&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC filed an administrative complaint to prevent the merger and sought to maintain the status quo pending completion of administrative hearings by filing a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction under the [[All Writs Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|28|1651|a}}. The All Writs Act, part of the first Judiciary Act of 1789 and essentially unchanged since then, empowers the federal courts to "issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." &lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Seventh Circuit==

The FTC argued that preliminary injunctive relief was needed pending completion of the administrative process in the FTC. According to the agency, otherwise, Dean would eliminate Bowman as a competitive entity by selling off its milk routes, its plants, and its equipment. This would prevent restoration of Dean as an effective competitor if the agency later found the merger unlawful. The FTC maintained that such preemptive action by Dean would effectively deprive the court of appeals of its appellate jurisdiction to review the FTC’s final order, because any order would be meaningless as a practical matter. On that basis, the FTC maintained, the All Writs Act supplied the court of appeals for the area in which the companies operated with jurisdiction to issue preliminary injunctive relief so that a meaningful appeal could later occur.&lt;ref&gt;See 384 U.S. at 600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit dismissed the petition on the ground that the FTC lacked authority to seek such relief (that is, it had no standing to sue), since Congress had not passed any statute giving the FTC specific authority to seek a preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=FTC v. Dean Foods Co. |vol=356 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=481 |pinpoint= |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=1966 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/356/481/303544/ |accessdate=2018-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point Dean immediately began closing Bowman down and eliminating it as a business.&lt;ref&gt;See 384 U.S. at 599 n.1 ("Since consummation of the merger, all assets of Bowman, with the exception of cash and marketable securities which were exempted from the purchase agreement, have been transferred to Dean. Bowman has ceased dairy operations, and now acts as an investment fund, having received and invested the proceeds of the sale.").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

[[File:Tom C. Clark.gif|thumb|150px|right|Justice Clark]]

The Supreme Court (5-4), in an opinion by Justice [[Tom C. Clark]]. recognized that the FTC had several times, without success, asked Congress to pass a law authorizing it to obtain preliminary injunctions in merger cases. The Court said that this did not matter: "Congress neither enacted nor rejected these proposals; it simply did not act on them." In any case, the Court added, nothing has limited the courts' historic powers under the All Writs Act. "We thus hold that the Commission has standing to seek preliminary relief from the Court of Appeals under the circumstances alleged."

[[File:SCOTUS Justice Abe Fortas.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Justice Fortas]]

Justice [[Abe Fortas]] wrote a strong dissent, saying that such awesome power to interfere with mergers should not be entrusted to the FTC without a specific authorization from Congress. Fortas had been legal advisor to Federated Department Stores, Inc, at the time of its four-month fight with the chairman and co-founder of Bullock's, Inc., which had involved an intra-family proxy fight in which such an injunction had been threatened. Federated eventually acquired Bullock's, but it was forced to compromise with the FTC in a consent decree in which Federated agreed to make no more acquisitions until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Kalman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x-Fbl_xE1E0C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=federated+stores+fortas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIokZkdtOt&amp;sig=uWZQPKpiD8PKbz2HcygjA3o_CDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirr6afo9LLAhWHGh4KHSwSAoMQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=federated%20stores%20fortas&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Abe Fortas: a Biography}}] 157-58, 163-64 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/21/bullocks-merger-into-federated-is-taking-shape.html?_r=0 ''Bullock's Merger Into Federated Is Taking Shape''], N.Y. {{smallcaps|Times}} (Aug. 21, 1964); {{smallcaps|Devin T.

==Significance and aftermath==

The reasoning of the Court is not limited to the FTC and by its terms would apply with equal force to any other federal agency in similar circumstances. 

However, the principle may be limited to situations of great urgency. In ''FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc. |vol=477 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=24 |pinpoint= |court=[[2d Cir.]] |date=1973 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/477/24/1533/ |accessdate=2018-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FTC sought a preliminary injunction against a merger and the Second Circuit denied it. The court said that, under ''Dean Foods'', an injunction can issue only if the Commission can show that "an effective remedial order, once the merger was implemented, would otherwise be virtually impossible, thus rendering the enforcement of any final decree of divestiture futile." The Second Circuit thought that the merger probably violated the antitrust laws but did not believe that effective relief would be “virtually impossible.”

In ''Sampson v. Murray'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Sampson v. Murray|volume=415|page=61|pin=77-78|year=1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held ''Dean Foods'' inapplicable to a stay of a GSA dismissal, stating: "In direct contrast to the claim of the FTC in ''Dean Foods'' that its jurisdiction would be effectively defeated by denial of relief, the Commission here has argued that judicial action interferes with the normal agency processes. And we see nothing in the record to suggest that any judicial review available under the doctrine of ''Service v. Dulles'' would be defeated in the same manner as review in ''Dean Foods''."

In the wake of similar decisions, in 1973 Congress passed specific legislation granting the FTC authority to bring suits in district courts to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent consummation of mergers pending action before the FTC, under a legal standard requiring likelihoods of success on the merits rather than a defeat of the agency proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|15|53|b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Congress passed the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Act]], which also created administrative clearance procedures having the effect of delaying consummation of mergers while agency evaluation of the competitive impact took place.

In 1984, the D.C. Circuit relied on ''Dean Foods'' as authority for issuance of an order to compel the FCC to act on a petition that it had allegedly delayed unreasonably in acting upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. FCC |vol=750 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=70 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.C. Cir.]] |date=1984 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/750/70/389443/ |accessdate=2018-09-01 |quote=}} The delay was almost 5 years. ''Id''. at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar|concepts}}

[[Feminism]] is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism Merriam-Webster dictionary], as accessed April 1, 2018, entry ''feminism'', sense 1.&lt;/ref&gt; even though many [[feminist movements and ideologies]] differ on exactly which claims and strategies are vital and justifiable to achieve equality.

However, equality, while supported by most feminists, is not universally seen as the required result of the feminist movement, even by feminists. Some consider it feminist to increase the rights of women from an origin that is less than man's without obtaining full equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|pp=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echols_Snitow_11_12"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|pp=289}}, citing Snitow, Ann, ''Retrenchment vs. Transformation: The Politics of the Anti-Pornography Movement'', in ''Caught Looking: Feminism, Pornography and Censorship'' (N.Y.: Caught Looking, 1986), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Their premise is that some gain of power is better than nothing. At the other end of the continuum, a minority of feminists have argued that women should set up at least one women-led society and some institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Dworkin]]: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/13/politics1 "Take No Prisoners", in ''The Guardian'', May 13, 2000], as accessed September 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spender_151_214"&gt;[[Dale Spender|Spender, Dale]], ''For the Record: The Making and Meaning of Feminist Knowledge'' (London: The Women's Press, 1985 ({{ISBN|0-7043-2862-3}})), p.&amp;nbsp;151 (on institutions) but see p.&amp;nbsp;214 (antibureaucratic).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesler_298_299"&gt;Chesler, Phyllis, ''Women and Madness'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1972 ({{ISBN|0-385-02671-4}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;298-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom is sought by those among feminists who believe that equality is undesirable or irrelevant, although some equate gaining an amount of freedom equal to that of men to the pursuit of equality, thus joining those who claim equality as central to feminism.&lt;ref name="FeminismAbyssFree-passim-espp96-nn11-15"&gt;{{harvp|Zerilli|2005|loc=''passim'', esp. p. 96 &amp; nn. 11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism"&gt;Gilman, Charlotte Perkins, ''What is "Feminism"?'', in ''The Sunday Herald'', Sep. 3, 1916, [§] ''Magazine'', p. [7] [of §], of ''The Boston Herald'' (Boston, Mass.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreement on definition==
According to Tilburg University women's studies chair Tineke M. Willemsen, "[i]t is hardly even possible to give a definition of feminism that every feminist will agree with".&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen, Tineke M., ''Feminism and Utopias: An Introduction'', in Lenning, Alkeline van, Marrie Bekker, &amp; Ine Vanwesenbeeck, eds., ''Feminist Utopias: In a Postmodern Era'' (Tilburg Univ. Press, 1997 ({{ISBN|90-361-9747-3}})), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Bronwyn Winter has criticized resistance to defining ''feminism'' for specialists and nonspecialists, a resistance "so widespread as to appear to be the dominant feminist theoretical position: a sort of 'non-position'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fty.sagepub.com/content/1/1/105 Winter, Bronwyn, ''Who Counts (or Doesn't Count) What as Feminist Theory?: An Exercise in Dictionary Use'', in ''Feminist Theory'', vol. 1, no. 1 (April, 2000)], as accessed Apr. 5, 2012 (possibly via different URL), p. 106 (internal single quotation marks so in original) (DOI 10.1177/14647000022229092).&lt;/ref&gt; However, definitions have been offered in feminist literature and practice.{{Citation needed|reason=References to some relatively widely accepted definitions would be useful here.|date=September 2018}}

==Equality==
Much of the literature defines ''feminism'' as being about equal rights for women or equality between the sexes. Not only did feminism influence equality among genders, but also in race. The Chicana Feminism Movement became politically active in the search for female and lesbian equality within American society. It challenged the roles of gender stereotypes.

Using different language, Riane Eisler, "re-examining human society from a gender-holistic perspective", "propose[d] ... two basic models of society", "[t]he first ... [being] the ''dominator'' model, ... what is popularly termed either patriarchy or matriarchy—the ''ranking'' of one half of humanity over the other" and "[t]he second, in which social relations are primarily based on the principle of ''linking'' rather than ranking, may best be described as the ''partnership'' model. In this model—beginning with the most fundamental difference in our species, between male and female—diversity is not equated with either inferiority or superiority."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eisler|1987|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he problem is not men as a sex, but men and women as they must be socialized in a dominator system."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eisler|1987|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated for a gylany, a partnership linking the two genders, in lieu of the present and historical androcracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eisler|1987|pp=185–203, 205–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of historical interest, [[Plato]], according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, around 394 &lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;, while believing that men ultimately would excel, argued that women should be equal with men politically, socially, sexually, educationally, and in military combat and should be able to enter the highest class of society, that most gender differences could not be explained by biology (Plato being one of the earliest published thinkers to say so), and that a system of [[child care]] would free women to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|pp=159–160}}, citing Rohrlich, R. &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, ''Women in Search of Utopia: Mavericks and Mythmakers'' (N.Y.: Schocken Books, 1984), and Plato, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (''ca.'' 394 B.C.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[radical feminism|radical feminist]]s critiqued equality, denying that "equality in an unjust society was worth fighting for".&lt;ref name="DaringBad-p139"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambiguous on equality==
{{see| Egalitarianism}}
"Feminism makes claims for a rebalancing between women and men of the social, economic, and political power within a given society, on behalf of both sexes in the name of their common humanity, but with respect for their differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Offen|1988|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''feminism'' and related words began being widely used in the 1890s in Europe and the Western Hemisphere and continuing into modern times, the terms' relationship to equality was often unclear. "Then, as now, many parties used the terms polemically, as epithets, rather than analytically; then, as now, the words were not used by everyone to mean the same thing. And, as the study of their history reveals, they referred far more often to the 'rights of women' than to 'rights equal to those of men.' This is a subtle but profound distinction. Even then the vocabulary of feminism connoted a far broader sociopolitical critique, a critique that was woman-centered and woman-celebratory in its onslaught on male privilege."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Offen|1988|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist author bell hooks&lt;!-- bell hooks is an author who spells her name entirely in lower case. --&gt; wrote, "Masses of people think that feminism is always and only about women seeking to be equal to men.... The feminism they hear about the most is portrayed by women who are primarily committed to gender equality — equal pay for equal work, and sometimes women and men sharing household chores and parenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|hooks|2000|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]eminism is a movement to end sexist oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|hooks|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Siegel "use[s] the term ["feminism"] in a general sense to refer to the philosophy powering a movement to eradicate sexism and better women's lives."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Deborah, ''Sisterhood, Interrupted: From Radical Women to Grrls Gone Wild'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007 ({{ISBN|978-1-4039-8204-9}})), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex and gender distinction|Genders (usually distinguished from sexes)]] are counted as other than two in some feminist utopian literature, according to Karin Schönpflug, analyzing works by [[Gabriel de Foigny]] (1676), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (1969), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (1976), [[Donna Haraway]] (1980), and Alkeline van Lenning (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascending toward equality==
Feminism in practice can be exhausting and expensive and other needs may compete for personal and organizational resources. Pragmatism may encourage seeking lesser goals, such as having more power than without feminism while not trying to seek full equality.

According to [[Alice Echols]], "Carol Hanisch ... argued that looking pretty and acting dumb were survival strategies which women should continue to use until such time as the 'power of unity' could replace them."&lt;ref name="DaringBad-p144"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feminist leader, Ann Snitow, speculated that [[difference feminism]] became preferred over [[gender equality]] so that "men might be more responsive".&lt;ref name="Echols_Snitow_11_12"/&gt;

In the late 18th century in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' of "[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I ... would fain convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks, and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.—I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a ''help meet'' for them! [¶] Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers—in a word, better citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=158}} (italicization so in original)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superiority==
According to [[Diane Davis]], radical feminisms "tend to be interested in female privilege rather than equality."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|2000|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist theology|Spiritual feminism]] and [[ecofeminism]], according to Prof. Davis, are interested less in equity than in finding ways to flip the ["masculine/feminine"] binary privilege"&lt;ref name="BreakingUpAtTotality-p145"&gt;{{harvp|Davis|2000|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; to place "the 'feminine' ... on top (so to speak)."&lt;ref name="BreakingUpAtTotality-p145" /&gt; Some authors of utopian fiction wrote about "ideal worlds in which women's positions are better than men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of feminists have called for the existence of one or possibly more [[Matriarchy#In feminist thought|societies in which women would govern women and men]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

==Freedom, apart from equality==
[[Difference feminism]] is based on the assumption that women and men are different, that for women to be equal to men means to be like men, which is not desirable.&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; Instead of equality, difference feminism is based on women having freedom.&lt;ref name="FeminismAbyssFree-passim-espp96-nn11-15" /&gt;

In 1916, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] argued for feminism without calling for "equality". Favoring women's "freedom"&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; and "full[ness]",&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; she wrote, "[f]eminism ... is the social awakening of the women of all the world. It is that great movement ... which is changing the centre of gravity in human life..... It is the movement for ... [among other goals] [women's] full economic independence..... [A]nti-feminists [speak] ... in their frantic fear of freedom for women."&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; She wrote of essential differences between women and men, including in motherhood and fatherhood,&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; and that "[f]eminists are women, plus: plus full human endowment and activity."&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt;

== Politics ==

=== Organisations ===
Examples of organizations in the [[United States|U.S.]] seeking equality are the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] ([[National Women's Political Caucus|NWPC]]) and the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) and, historically, the [[National Woman's Party]] ([[National Woman's Party|NWP]]). NOW, at its first national conference, in 1967, called for equality, e.g., "Equal Rights Constitutional Amendment", "Equal and Unsegregated Education", "Equal Job Training Opportunities", "equal employment opportunity [to] be guaranteed to all women, as well as men", "the right of women to be educated to their full potential equally with men ... eliminating all discrimination and segregation by sex", and "the right of women in poverty to secure job training, housing, and family allowances on equal terms with men".&lt;ref&gt;''NOW (National Organization for Women) Bill of Rights'', in [[Robin Morgan|Morgan, Robin]], ed., ''[[Sisterhood Is Powerful|Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From the Women's Liberation Movement]]'' (N.Y.: Random House, 1st ed. 1970), pp. 512–513 (§ ''Historical Documents'') ("[a]dopted at NOW's first national conference, Washington, D.C., 1967", per ''id.'', p. 512).&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Notable Politicians ===
[[Victoria Woodhull]] ran in the 1872 election to be [[President of the United States|President of the U.S.]], asserting a right to equality.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Mary, ''Notorious Victoria: The Life of Victoria Woodhull, Uncensored'' (Chapel Hill, N.Car.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1st ed. 1998 ({{ISBN|1-56512-132-5}})), ''passim'', esp. pp. 54–57 &amp; nn..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 ({{ISBN|1-882593-10-3}})), ''passim'', esp. ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Nesta Helen Webster]], a political conservative in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] early in the 20th century, implied the genders might be equal&lt;ref name="VoiceConspiracy"&gt;Lee, Martha F., ''Nesta Webster: The Voice of Conspiracy'', in ''Journal of Women's History'', vol. 17, no. 3 (Fall, 2005), p. 81 ''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that there had been "women's supremacy ... [in] pre-revolutionary France, when powerful women never attempted to compete directly with men, but instead drew strength from other areas where they excelled, in particular, 'the power of organisation and the power of inspiration.'"&lt;ref name="VoiceConspiracy" /&gt;

In economics, the '''free-rider problem''' occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods, or services do not pay for them, which results in an underprovision of those goods or services.&lt;ref name=Baumol&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumol |first=William |title=Welfare Economics and the Theory of the State |year=1952 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a free-rider may frequently ask for available parking lots ([[public goods]]) from those who have already paid for them, in order to benefit from free parking. That is, the free-rider may use the parking even more than the others without paying a penny. The free-rider problem is the question of how to limit free riding and its negative effects in these situations. The free-rider problem may occur when property rights are not clearly defined and imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pasour, Jr. |first1=E. C. |title=The Free Rider as a Basis for Government Intervention |url=https://direct.mises.org/journals/jls/5_4/5_4_6.pdf |publisher=Libertarian Studies |accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free-rider problem is common with goods which are [[non-excludability|non-excludable]], including [[public good]]s and situations of the [[Tragedy of the Commons]].

Although the term "free rider" was first used in economic theory of public goods, similar concepts have been applied to other contexts, including [[collective bargaining]], antitrust law, psychology and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hendriks |first=Carolyn M. |date=December 2006 |title=When the Forum Meets Interest Politics: Strategic Uses of Public Deliberation |journal=Politics &amp; Society (Vol. 34-4) |doi=10.1177/0032329206293641}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some individuals in a team or community may reduce their contributions or performance if they believe that one or more other members of the group may free ride.&lt;ref&gt;Ruël, Gwenny Ch.; Bastiaans, Nienke and Nauta, Aukje. [http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeA/2003/03A42/03a42.pdf "Free-riding and team performance in project education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The economic problem with free riding==
Free riding is a problem of [[Pareto efficiency|economic inefficiency]] when it leads to the under-production or over-consumption of a good. For example, when people are asked how much they value a particular public good, with that value measured in terms of how much money they would be willing to pay, their tendency is to under report their valuations.&lt;ref name="Economics and the Environment"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodstein |first1=Eban |title=Economics and the Environment |date=2014 |publisher=Library of Congress |location=University of Minnesota |isbn=978-1-118-53972-9 |edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goods which are subject to free riding are usually characterized by the inability to exclude non-payers. This problem is sometimes compounded by the fact that common-property goods are characterized by rival consumption. Not only can consumers of common-property goods benefit without payment, but consumption by one imposes an opportunity cost on others. This will lead to overconsumption and even possibly exhaustion or destruction of the common-property good. If too many people start to free ride, a system or service will eventually not have enough resources to operate.

The other problem of free-riding is experienced when the production of goods does not consider the [[Externality|external costs]], particularly the use of [[ecosystem services]].

=== Assurance contracts ===
{{Main|Assurance contract}}

An [[assurance contract]] is a contract in which participants make a binding pledge to contribute to building a public good, contingent on a quorum of a predetermined size being reached.  Otherwise the good is not provided and any monetary contributions are refunded.

A [[assurance contract#Variants|dominant assurance contract]] is a variation in which an entrepreneur creates the contract and refunds the initial pledge plus an additional sum of money if the quorum is not reached.  (The entrepreneur profits by collecting a fee if the quorum is reached and the good is provided.) In [[game theory|game-theoretic]] terms this makes pledging to build the public good a dominant strategy: the best move is to pledge to the contract regardless of the actions of others.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf |title={title} |access-date=16 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112223855/http://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf |archive-date=12 January 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coasian solution ===
A ''Coasian solution'', named for the economist [[Ronald Coase]], proposes that potential beneficiaries of a public good can negotiate to pool their resources and create it, based on each party's self-interested willingness to pay.  His treatise, "The Problem of Social Cost" (1960), argued that if the [[transaction cost]]s between potential beneficiaries of a public good are low—that it is easy for potential beneficiaries to find each other and organize a pooling their resources based upon the good's value to each of them—that public goods could be produced without government action.&lt;ref name=Coase1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |date=October 1960 |volume=3 |pages=1–44 |doi=10.1086/466560 |title=The Problem of Social Cost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, Coase himself wrote that while what had become known as the Coase Theorem had explored the implications of zero transaction costs, he had actually intended to use this construct as a stepping-stone to understand the real world of positive transaction costs, corporations, legal systems and government actions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fox |first=Glenn |title=The Real Coase Theorems |url=http://www.canadianjusticereviewboard.ca/archive-Dr._Glenn_Fox_on_The_Real_Coase_Theorems.pdf |website=Cato Journal 27, Fall 2007 |publisher=Cato Institute, Washington, D.C. |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723053515/http://www.canadianjusticereviewboard.ca/archive-Dr._Glenn_Fox_on_The_Real_Coase_Theorems.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coase1988_1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coase |first=Ronald |title=The Firm, the Market and the Law |year=1988 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I examined what would happen in a world in which transaction costs were assumed to be zero. My aim in doing so was not to describe what life would be like in such a world but to provide a simple setting in which to develop the analysis and, what was even more important, to make clear the fundamental role which transaction costs do, and should, play in the fashioning of the institutions which make up the economic system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Coase also wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The world of zero transaction costs has often been described as a Coasian world. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the world of modern economic theory, one which I was hoping to persuade economists to leave.  What I did in "The Problem of Social Cost" was simply to shed light on some of its properties. I argued in such a world the allocation of resources would be independent of the legal position, a result which Stigler dubbed the "Coase theorem".&lt;ref name="Coase1988_2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Firm, the Market and the Law |last=Coase |first=Ronald |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1988 |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, while Coase himself appears to have considered the "Coase theorem" and Coasian solutions as simplified constructs to ultimately consider the real 20th-century world of governments and laws and corporations, these concepts have become attached to a world where transaction costs were much lower, and government intervention would unquestionably be less necessary.

A minor alternative, especially for information goods, is for the producer to refuse to release a good to the public until payment to cover costs is met. Author [[Stephen King]], for instance, authored chapters of a new novel downloadable for free on his website while stating that he would not release subsequent chapters unless a certain amount of money was raised. Sometimes dubbed ''holding for ransom'', this method of public goods production is a modern application of the [[street performer protocol]] for public goods production. Unlike assurance contracts, its success relies largely on social norms to ensure (to some extent) that the threshold is reached and partial contributions are not wasted.

One of the purest Coasian solutions today is the new phenomenon of Internet [[crowdfunding]]. Here rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts as well as social pressure.  For example, on the [[Kickstarter]] site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met.&lt;ref name=kick&gt;{{cite web |title=Kickstarter FAQ |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics?ref=faq_nav#Kick |accessdate=17 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226050118/https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics?ref=faq_nav#Kick |archive-date=26 February 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because automation and the Internet so reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, project goals of only a few hundred dollars are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors.

=== Government provision ===
If voluntary provision of public goods will not work, then the solution is making their provision involuntary. This saves each of us from our own tendency to be a free rider, while also assuring us that no one else will be allowed to free ride.  One frequently proposed solution to the problem is for governments or [[State (polity)|states]] to impose [[taxation]] to fund the production of public goods. This does not actually solve the theoretical problem because ''good government'' is itself a public good.  Thus it is difficult to ensure the government has an incentive to provide the optimum amount even if it were possible for the government to determine precisely what amount would be optimum.  These issues are studied by [[public choice]] theory and [[public finance]].

Sometimes the government provides public goods using "unfunded mandates". An example is the requirement that every car be fit with a [[catalytic converter]]. This may be executed in the [[private sector]], but the end result is predetermined by the state: the individually involuntary provision of the public good [[air pollution|clean air]]. Unfunded mandates have also been imposed by the U.S. federal government on the state and local governments, as with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], for example.

Regardless the role of the government is provide vital goods to all individuals, some of which they cannot obtain on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Donald. "The Proper Role of Government: Considering Public Goods and Private Goods". The Pennsylvania State University, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure that government services are properly funded taxes and other government controlled entities are enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Jakacky, Gary. "The Role of Government in Providing". Newsmax Finance, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although enforced taxes deter the free-rider problem many contend that some goods should be excluded and made into private goods. However, this not possible with all goods such as pure public goods that are inseparable and inclusive, thus require "provision by public means".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Bill. "Public Goods and Services". The Social Studies Help Center, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the government has a responsibility to ensure that the social welfare of individuals is met as opposed to privatized goods.&lt;ref&gt;Holtz, Brian. "The Proper Role of Government". Holtz for Congress, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidies and joint products ===
A government may [[subsidy|subsidize]] production of a public good in the private sector. Unlike government provision, subsidies may result in some form of a [[competition|competitive]] market. The potential for [[crony capitalism|cronyism]] (for example, an alliance between political insiders and the businesses receiving subsidies) can be limited with secret bidding for the subsidies or application of the subsidies following clear general principles. Depending on the nature of a public good and a related subsidy, [[principal–agent problem]]s can arise between the citizens and the government or between the government and the subsidized producers; this effect and counter-measures taken to address it can diminish the benefits of the subsidy.

Subsidies can also be used in areas with a potential for [[Public good#Non-individualism|non-individualism]]: For instance, a state may subsidize devices to reduce [[air pollution]] and appeal to citizens to cover the remaining costs.

Similarly, a joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good. For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be ''tied'' to a donation to a charity (public good).  It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).

=== Privileged group ===
The study of [[collective action]] shows that public goods are still produced when one individual benefits more from the public good than it costs him to produce it; examples include benefits from individual use, [[intrinsic motivation]] to produce, and [[business model]]s based on selling [[complement good]]s. A group that contains such individuals is called a [[privileged group]]. A historical example could be a downtown entrepreneur who erects a street light in front of his shop to attract customers; even though there are positive external benefits to neighboring nonpaying businesses, the added customers to the paying shop provide enough revenue to cover the costs of the street light.

The existence of privileged groups may not be a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as [[underproduction]] of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.

An example of the privileged group solution could be the [[Linux]] community, assuming that users derive more benefit from contributing than it costs them to do it. For more discussion on this topic see also [[Coase's Penguin]].

Another example is those musicians and writers who create music and writings for their own personal enjoyment, and publish because they enjoy having an audience.  Financial incentives are not necessary to ensure the creation of these public goods.  Whether this creates the correct production level of writings and music is an open question.

=== Merging free riders ===
Another method of overcoming the free rider problem is to simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not need to worry about free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.

While the purchase of all potential free riders may solve the problem of underproduction due to free riders in smaller markets, it may simultaneously introduce the problem of underproduction due to [[monopoly]]. Additionally, some markets are simply too large to make a buyout of all beneficiaries feasible—this is particularly visible with public goods that affect everyone in a country.

=== Introducing an exclusion mechanism (club goods) ===
Another solution, which has evolved for information goods, is to introduce exclusion mechanisms which turn public goods into [[club good]]s.  One well-known example is [[copyright]] and [[patent]] laws.  These laws, which in the 20th century came to be called [[intellectual property]] laws, attempt to remove the natural non-excludability by prohibiting reproduction of the good.  Although they can address the free rider problem, the downside of these laws is that they imply private monopoly power and thus are not [[Pareto-optimal]].

For example, in the United States, the patent rights given to pharmaceutical companies encourage them to charge high prices (above [[marginal cost]])&lt;!--I'm hiding this, not removing it, just in case.{{Dubious|date=August 2011| reason=Patents encourage pharmaceutical research (which is absurdly expensive) by allowing companies to have some time to recuperate their losses via market monopoly.  If a company had to share the market immediately, they would be unlikely to recover the amount lost during research.  See "generic competition paradox", which shows that it is actually the loss of the patent that causes prices to skyrocket.}}--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/Do-patents-increase-the-price-of-drugs&lt;/ref&gt; and to advertise to convince patients to persuade their doctors to prescribe the drugs.{{Dubious|date=August 2011| reason= Advertising is done by companies that don't have patents, too.  The choice to advertise is completely unrelated to patents}}  Likewise, copyright provides an incentive for a publisher to act like [[The Dog in the Manger]], taking older works [[out of print]] so as not to cannibalize revenue from the publisher's own new works.&lt;ref&gt;Examples from the entertainment industry include [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]'s "[[Disney Vault|vault]]" sales practice and its outright refusal to issue ''[[Song of the South]]'' on home video in most markets. Examples from the computer software industry include [[Microsoft]]'s decision to pull [[Windows XP]] from the market in mid-2008 to drive revenue from the widely criticized [[Windows Vista]] operating system.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed|date=August 2011}}

The laws also end up encouraging patent and copyright owners to sue even mild imitators in court and to lobby for the extension of the term of the exclusive rights in a form of [[rent seeking]].

These problems with the club-good mechanism arise because the underlying [[marginal cost]] of giving the good to more people is low or zero, but, because of the limits of [[price discrimination]] those who are unwilling or unable to pay a profit-maximizing price do not gain access to the good.

If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the collaboration, club goods can emerge naturally. [[James M. Buchanan]] showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Buchanan (February 1965). "An Economic Theory of Clubs". Economica. 32 (125): 1–14. doi:10.2307/2552442. JSTOR 2552442.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the inefficiencies and inequities of club goods exclusions sometimes cause potentially excludable club goods to be treated as public goods, and their production financed by some other mechanism.  Examples of such "natural" club goods include [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] with very high fixed costs, private golf courses, cinemas, cable television and social clubs.  This explains why many such goods are often provided or subsidized by governments, co-operatives or volunteer associations, rather than being left to be supplied by profit-minded entrepreneurs.  These goods are often known as ''social goods''.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] claimed that the "excess profits", or profits over normal profit, generated by the copyright or patent monopoly will attract competitors that will make technological innovations and thereby end the monopoly. This is a continual process referred to as "Schumpeterian [[creative destruction]]", and its applicability to different types of public goods is a source of some controversy. The supporters of the theory point to the case of Microsoft, for example, which has been increasing its prices (or lowering its products' quality), predicting that these practices will make increased market shares for Linux and Apple largely inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A nation can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club. This is further studied in the Theory of the State.

== Altruistic solutions ==

=== Social norms ===
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2017}}When enough people do not think like free-riders, the private and voluntary provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. Other public-spirited individuals don't do this and might even pick up existing litter. Reasons for the act could be that the person derives pleasure from helping their community, feels ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them, or could be emotionally attached to the public good. People unconsciously adapt their behavior to that of their peers; this is [[conformity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Even people who engaged in free-riding by littering elsewhere are less likely to if they see others hold on to their trash.

Social norms can be observed wherever people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, can also be applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.

=== Social sanctions (punishment) ===
Experimental literature suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do not contribute to the public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elinor Ostrom |author2=James Walker |author3=Roy Gardner |authorlink1=Elinor Ostrom |title=Covenants With and without a Sword: Self-Governance Is Possible |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |date=June 1992 |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=404–17 |doi=10.2307/1964229|jstor=1964229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., &amp; S. Gächter (2000) "Cooperation and Punishment in Public Goods Experiments"'', 90 American Economic Review'' 980.&lt;/ref&gt; Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fehr |first1=Ernst |last2=Gächter |first2=Simon |year=2002 |title=Altruistic punishment in humans |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6868 |pages=137–40 |doi=10.1038/415137a|pmid=11805825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dreber |first1=Anna |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Winners don't punish |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=452 |issue=7185 |pages=348–51 |doi=10.1038/nature06723 |pmid=18354481 |pmc=2292414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of others perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kristoffel Grechenig |first1=Nicklisch |last2=Thöni |first2=C. |year=2010 |title=Punishment despite reasonable doubt – a public goods experiment with sanctions under uncertainty |ssrn=1586775 |journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=847–67 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary organizations ===
Organizations such as the [[Red Cross]], [[public radio]] and [[public broadcasting|television]] or a [[volunteer fire department]] provide public goods to the majority at the expense of a minority who voluntarily participate or contribute funds. Contributions to online collaborative media like [[Wikipedia]] and other [[wiki]] projects, and [[free software]] projects such as [[Linux]] are another example of relatively few contributors providing a public good (information) freely to all readers or software users.

Proposed explanations for [[altruism|altruistic]] behavior include [[Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|biological altruism]] and [[reciprocal altruism]].  For example, voluntary groups such as labor unions and charities often have a federated structure, probably in part because voluntary collaboration emerges more readily in smaller social groups than in large ones (e.g., see [[Dunbar's number]]).

While both biological and reciprocal altruism are observed in other animals, our species' complex social behaviors take these raw materials much farther. [[Philanthropy]] by wealthy individuals—some, such as [[Andrew Carnegie]] giving away their entire vast fortunes—have historically provided a multitude of public goods for others.  One major impact was the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s development of the "[[Green Revolution]]" hybrid grains that probably saved many millions of people from starvation in the 1970s. [[Christian missionaries]], who typically spend large parts of their lives in remote, often dangerous places, have had disproportionate impact compared with their numbers worldwide for centuries. [[Communist]] revolutionaries in the 20th century had similar dedication and outsized impacts.  International relief organizations such as [[Doctors Without Borders]], [[Save the Children]] and [[Amnesty International]] have benefited millions, while also occasionally costing workers their lives.  For better and for worse, humans can conceive of, and sacrifice for, an almost infinite variety of causes in addition to their biological kin.

=== Religions and ideologies ===
[[File:The noblest motive is the public good - Jefferson Building - Library of Congress.jpg|thumb|"The noblest motive is the public good." [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], [[Library of Congress]].]]

Voluntary altruistic organizations often motivate their members by encouraging deep-seated personal beliefs, whether religious or other (such as social justice or environmentalism) that are taken "on faith" more than proved by rational argument.  When individuals resist temptations to free riding (e.g., stealing) because they hold these beliefs (or because they fear the disapproval of others who do), they provide others with public goods that might be difficult or impossible to "produce" by administrative coercion alone.

One proposed explanation for the ubiquity of religious belief in human societies is [[Group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multi-level selection]]: altruists often lose out within groups, but groups with more altruists win.  A group whose members believe a "practical reality" that motivates altruistic behavior may out-compete other groups whose members' perception of "factual reality" causes them to behave selfishly. A classic example is a soldier's willingness to fight for his tribe or country. Another example given in evolutionary biologist [[David Sloan Wilson]]'s ''[[Darwin's Cathedral]]'' is the [[early Christian church]] under the late [[Roman Empire]]; because Roman society was highly individualistic, during frequent epidemics many of the sick died not of the diseases ''per se'' but for lack of basic nursing. Christians, who believed in an afterlife, were willing to nurse the sick despite the risks. Although the death rate among the nurses was high, the average Christian had a ''much better chance'' of surviving an epidemic than other Romans did, and the community prospered.

Religious and non-religious traditions and ideologies (such as [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]]) are in full view when a society is in crisis and public goods such as defense are most needed. Wartime leaders invoke their God's protection and claim that their society's most hallowed traditions are at stake. For example, according to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] during the [[American Civil War]], the Union was fighting so "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".  Such voluntary, if exaggerated, exhortations complement forcible measures—taxation and conscription—to motivate people to make sacrifices for their cause.

[[File:Freedom of Thought Ben Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|"Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom &amp; no such thing as publick liberty without freedom of speech", [[Benjamin Franklin]], 1722.]]

'''Freedom of thought''' (also called  '''freedom of conscience''' or '''ideas''') is the [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] of an individual to hold or consider a fact, viewpoint, or [[thought]], independent of others' viewpoints. 

== Overview ==
&lt;!-- Note: perhaps something could be mentioned here about the Four Freedoms proposed by Franklin Roosevelt, which also includes freedom from fear and freedom from want --&gt;

Freedom of thought is the precursor and progenitor of—and thus is closely linked to—other liberties, including [[freedom of religion]], freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Though freedom of thought is axiomatic for many other freedoms they are in no way required for it to operate and exist. The conception of a freedom or a right does not guarantee its inclusion, legality, or protection via a philosophical caveat. It is a very important concept in the Western world and nearly all{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} democratic constitutions protect these freedoms. For instance, the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] contains the famous guarantee in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] that laws may not be made that interfere with religion "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". U.S. [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Benjamin Cardozo]] reasoned in ''[[Palko v. Connecticut]]'' (1937):

{{quote|Freedom of thought... is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of this truth can be traced in our history, political and legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
 |litigants=Palko v. State of Connecticut

 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=302&amp;invol=319
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such ideas are also a vital part of [[international human rights law]]. In the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), "freedom of thought" is listed under Article 18:

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

The [[United Nations]]' [[Human Rights Committee]] states that this, "distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one's choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=General Comment No. 22: The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Art. 18) : . 30/07/93. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, General Comment No. 22. (General Comments)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Article 19 of the UDHR guarantees that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference".

==History of development and suppression==
{{wikinews|Interview with dismissed Ocean Drive columnist Trisha Posner}}

It is impossible to know with certainty what another person is thinking, making suppression difficult. The concept is developed throughout the Bible, most fully in the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus]] (e.g., "For why should my freedom [''eleutheria''] be judged by another's conscience [''suneideseos'']?" [[1 Corinthians]] 10:29).&lt;ref&gt;Eugene J. Cooper, "Man's Basic Freedom and Freedom of Conscience in the Bible : Reflections on 1 Corinthians 8–10", ''Irish Theological Quarterly'' Dec 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GiordanoBrunoCampodeiFiori cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bronze statue of [[Giordano Bruno]], Campo de' Fiori, Rome]]
Although Greek philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] had discussed Freedom of Thought minimally, the edicts of King [[Ashoka]] (3rd century BC) have been called the first decree respecting Freedom of Conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6cL9Jng5okC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22freedom+of+conscience%22+ashoka&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22freedom%20of%20conscience%22%20ashoka&amp;f=true|title=Luigi Luzzatti, "The First Decree on Freedom of Conscience" p. 47 in ''God in Freedom''|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European tradition, aside from the decree of religious toleration by [[Constantine I]] at Milan in 313, the philosophers [[Themistius]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Voltaire]], [[Alexandre Vinet]], and [[John Stuart Mill]] have been considered major proponents of the idea of Freedom of Conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Luzzatti, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth I]] revoked a thought censorship law in the late sixteenth century, because, according to Sir [[Francis Bacon]], she did "not [like] to make windows into men's souls and secret thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brimacombe |first=Peter |title=All the Queen's Men: The World of Elizabeth I |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2000 |pages=125 |isbn=0-312-23251-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her reign, philosopher, mathematician, [[astrologer]], and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] took refuge in England from the [[Italian Inquisition]], where he published a number of his books regarding an infinite universe and topics banned by the Catholic Church. After leaving the safety of England, Bruno was eventually [[Execution by burning|burned]] as a [[Christian heresy|heretic]] in Rome for refusing to recant his ideas. For this reason, he is considered by some to be a martyr for free thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Giordano Bruno: Martyrs of free thought no. 1|author=Arturo Labriola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[freedom of expression]] can be limited through [[censorship]], arrests, [[book burning]], or [[propaganda]], and this tends to discourage freedom of thought. Examples of effective campaigns against freedom of expression are the Soviet suppression of genetics research in favor of a theory known as [[Lysenkoism]], the book-burning campaigns of [[Nazi Germany]], the radical [[anti-intellectualism]] enforced in [[Cambodia]] under [[Pol Pot]], the strict limits on freedom of expression imposed by the [[communist state|Communist]] governments of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and Cuba or by [[right-wing authoritarian]] dictatorships such as those of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]] and [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]].

The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], which states that [[thought]] is inherently embedded in [[language]], would support the claim that an effort to limit the use of words of language is actually a form of restricting freedom of thought.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This was explored in [[George Orwell]]'s novel'' [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', with the idea of [[Newspeak]], a stripped-down form of the [[English language]] lacking the capacity for metaphor and limiting expression of original ideas.

{{News release|date=May 2012}}
'''Greenhouse debt''' is the measure to which an individual person, incorporated association, business enterprise, government instrumentality or / [and] (per Neb., USA) geographic community exceeds its permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]] and contributes [[greenhouse gas]]es that contribute to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The concept makes no sense without a clear numerical value for the permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]]. It is not clear what this value is.

[[Friends of the Earth]] and similar organisations put forward the concept to define specifically the environmental harm caused by developed countries' past and present policies.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth International. 2000. "Greenhouse debt".  ''Link'' (20):  http://www.foei.org/en/publications/link/92/e92greenhouse_debt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments, at least the Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] leadership, have a tendency to accept such a line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Hamilton, "We will all pay for Howard's hidden greenhouse debt", Crikey, Friday, 14 December 2007: http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20071214-Howards-Hidden-Greenhouse-Debt-.html?CurrentDate=14+%2F+01+%2F+2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greenhouse debt assessment thus forms an [[ecological footprint]] analysis but can be used separately. Taken conjointly with a 'water debt' [[needs assessment|analysis]] and an [[environmental impact assessment|ecological impact assessment]], greenhouse debt analysis is basic to giving individuals, organisations, governments and communities an understanding of the effects they are having on [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], [[life]], and [[global warming]].  

Ensuring that the greenhouse debt is zero is essential towards achieving [[ecologically sustainable development]] or a [[sustainable retreat]]. Any greenhouse debt incurred will contribute to making life harder for future generations of humans and [[non-human]] lifeforms.

There are three possible consequences that occur as a result of a greenhouse debt.

#''[[Mitigation of global warming|Mitigation]]:'' finding compensatory ways of reducing the greenhouse debt so its effects are neutralised
#''[[Adaptation]]:'' finding ways of adjusting to the resulting global warming or climate change
#''[[Suffering]]:'' having one's quality of life reduced as a result of the consequences

[[File:Fra Carnevale - The Ideal City - Walters 37677.jpg|thumb|500px|''The Ideal City'' by [[Fra Carnevale]], c. between 1480-1484.]]
An '''ideal city''' is the concept of a [[City planning|plan]] for a [[city]] that has been conceived in accordance with a particular rational or moral objective.

==Concept==
The "ideal" nature of such a city may encompass the [[moral]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[juridical]] qualities of [[citizenship]] as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc.  The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town planning) or other geometrical patterns.  The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy [[Utopian]] ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as [[St Thomas More]]'s [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]].

==History==
[[File:Formerly_Piero_della_Francesca_-_Ideal_City_-_Galleria_Nazionale_delle_Marche_Urbino_2.jpg|thumb|350px|The ideal city attributed to [[Luciano Laurana]] or [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Several attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the [[Renaissance]], and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of [[Plato]], whose ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'.   The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilisation]], sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture.

==Examples==
[[File:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan of [[Sforzinda]], Filarete, c. 1465]]
[[Image:Palmanova1600.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Palmanova]] in 1593. The town is encircled by massive [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Venetian Defensive Systems]] that are a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/331/|title=The city of Bergamo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Examples of the ideal cities include [[Filarete]]'s "[[Sforzinda]]", a description of which was included in his ''Trattato di Architettura'' (c. 1465).  The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular [[moat]].  Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called "Urbino" and "Baltimore" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show [[Classical architecture|Classically]] influenced architecture disposed in logically planned [[piazza]]s. The cities of [[Palmanova]] and [[Nicosia]], whose [[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Ventian Fortess]] were built in the 1590s by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosmescu|first1=Dragos|title=Nicosia|url=http://fortified-places.com/nicosia/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable example of the concept is [[Zamość]] in eastern [[Poland]] founded in the late 16th century, modelled by the Italian architect [[Bernardo Morando]].

[[James Oglethorpe]] synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the [[Province of Carolina]]. The physical design component of the famous [[Oglethorpe Plan]] remains preserved in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the [[Garden city movement]] of Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]], realised at [[Letchworth Garden City]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in England.  [[Poundbury]], [[Prince Charles]]' architectural vision established in [[Dorset]], is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning.

In [[economics]], an '''input–output model''' is a quantitative economic technique that represents the interdependencies between different branches of a national economy or different regional economies.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;Thijs Ten Raa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nu0FAvNiFhYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Input–output economics: theory and applications: featuring Asian economies]'', World Scientific, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Leontief]] (1906–1999) is credited with developing this type of analysis and earned the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his development of this model.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[Francois Quesnay]] had developed a cruder version of this technique called [[Tableau économique]], and [[Léon Walras]]'s work ''Elements of Pure Economics'' on [[general equilibrium theory]] also was a forerunner and made a generalization of Leontief's seminal concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Éléments d'économie politique pure, ou théorie de la richesse sociale |trans-title=Elements of Pure Economics, or The Theory of Social Wealth |first=L. |last=Walras |location= |publisher= |year=1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] has been credited with originating the concept in a report delivered to the [[First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour|All Russia Conference on the Scientific Organisation of Labour and Production Processes]], in January 1921.&lt;ref name=Belykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belykh|first=A. A.|title=A Note on the Origins of Input-Output Analysis and the Contribution of the Early Soviet Economists: Chayanov, Bogdanov and Kritsman|journal=Soviet Studies|date=July 1989|volume=41|issue=3|pages=426–429|doi=10.1080/09668138908411823}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was also developed by L. N. Kritsman and T. F. Remington, who has argued that their work provided a link between Quesnay's tableau économique and the subsequent contributions by [[Vladimir Groman]] and [[Vladimir Bazarov]] to [[Gosplan]]'s method of [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref name=Belykh /&gt;

Wassily Leontief's work in the input-output model was influenced by the works of the classical economists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]. Karl Marx's economics provided an early outline involving a set of tables where the economy consisted of two interlinked departments.&lt;ref name="Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis, 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis |first=D. L. |last=Clark |year=1984 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=408–429 |doi=10.1080/00472338485390301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leontief was the first to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation of a national (or regional) economy.

== Basic derivation ==
The model depicts inter-industry relationships within an economy, showing how output from one industrial sector may become an input to another industrial sector. In the inter-industry matrix, column entries typically represent inputs to an industrial sector, while row entries represent outputs from a given sector. This format therefore shows how dependent each sector is on every other sector, both as a customer of outputs from other sectors and as a supplier of inputs. Each column of the input–output [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] shows the monetary value of inputs to each sector and each row represents the value of each sector's outputs.

Say that we have an economy with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; sectors. Each sector produces &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; units of a single homogeneous good. Assume that the &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;th sector, in order to produce 1 unit, must use &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; units from sector &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, assume that each sector sells some of its output to other sectors (intermediate output) and some of its output to consumers (final output, or final demand). Call final demand in the &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;th sector &lt;math&gt; d_i &lt;/math&gt;. Then we might write

:&lt;math&gt;

x_i = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \ldots + a_{in}x_n + d_i,

&lt;/math&gt;

or total output equals intermediate output plus final output. If we let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be the matrix of coefficients &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of total output, and &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of final demand, then our expression for the economy becomes

:&lt;math&gt;

x = Ax + d

&lt;/math&gt;

which after re-writing becomes &lt;math&gt; (I - A)x = d &lt;/math&gt;. If the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; is invertible then this is a linear system of equations with a unique solution, and so given some final demand vector the required output can be found. Furthermore, if the principal [[Minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; are all positive (known as the [[Hawkins–Simon condition]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nikaido |first=H. |title=Introduction to Sets and Mappings in Modern Economics |location=New York |publisher=Elsevier |year=1970 |isbn=0-444-10038-5 |pages=13–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the required output vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative.

=== Example ===

Consider an economy with two goods, A and B. The matrix of coefficients and the final demand is given by

:&lt;math&gt;

A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0.5 &amp; 0.2 \\ 0.4 &amp; 0.1 \end{array}\right) \text{ and } d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 7 \\ 4 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this corresponds to finding the amount of output each sector should produce given that we want 7 units of good A and 4 units of good B. Then solving the system of linear equations derived above gives us

:&lt;math&gt;

x = (I - A)^{-1} d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 19.19 \\ 12.97 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Further research ===

There is an extensive literature on these models. There is the Hawkins–Simon condition on producibility. There has been research on disaggregation to clustered inter-industry flows, and on the study of constellations of industries. A great deal of empirical work has been done to identify coefficients, and data has been published for the national economy as well as for regions. The Leontief system can be extended to a model of general equilibrium; it offers a method of decomposing work done at a macro level.

=== Introducing transportation ===

Transportation is implicit in the notion of inter-industry flows. It is explicitly recognized when transportation is identified as an industry – how much is purchased from transportation in order to produce. But this is not very satisfactory because transportation requirements differ, depending on industry locations and capacity constraints on regional production. Also, the receiver of goods generally pays freight cost, and often transportation data are lost because transportation costs are treated as part of the cost of the goods.

[[Walter Isard]] and his student, [[Leon Moses]], were quick to see the spatial economy and transportation implications of input–output, and began work in this area in the 1950s developing a concept of interregional input–output. Take a one region versus the world case. We wish to know something about interregional commodity flows, so introduce a column into the table headed "exports" and we introduce an "import" row.

A more satisfactory way to proceed would be to tie regions together at the industry level. That is, we could identify both intra-region inter-industry transactions and inter-region inter-industry transactions. The problem here is that the table grows quickly.

Input–output is conceptually simple. Its extension to a model of equilibrium in the national economy has been done successfully using high-quality data. One who wishes to do work with input–output systems must deal skillfully with industry classification, data estimation, and inverting very large, ill-conditioned matrices. Moreover, changes in relative prices are not readily handled by this modeling approach alone. Of course, input–output accounts are part and parcel to a more flexible form of modeling, [[Computable general equilibrium]] models.

Two additional difficulties are of interest in transportation work. There is the question of substituting one input for another, and there is the question about the stability of coefficients as production increases or decreases. These are intertwined questions. They have to do with the nature of regional production functions.

==Usefulness==

Because the input–output model is fundamentally linear in nature, it lends itself to rapid computation as well as flexibility in computing the effects of changes in demand. Input–output models for different regions can also be linked together to investigate the effects of inter-regional trade, and additional columns can be added to the table to perform [[environmentally extended input-output analysis]] (EEIOA). For example, information on fossil fuel inputs to each sector can be used to investigate flows of embodied carbon within and between different economies.

The structure of the input–output model has been incorporated into national accounting in many developed countries, and as such can be used to calculate important measures such as national GDP. Input–output economics has been used to study regional economies within a nation, and as a tool for national and regional economic planning. A main use of input–output analysis is to measure the economic impacts of events as well as public investments or programs as shown by [[IMPLAN]] and [[Regional Input-Output Modeling System]]. It is also used to identify economically related industry clusters and also so-called "key" or "target" industries (industries that are most likely to enhance the internal coherence of a specified economy). By linking industrial output to satellite accounts articulating energy use, effluent production, space needs, and so on, input–output analysts&lt;!-- Who? --&gt; have extended&lt;!-- Font? --&gt; the approaches application to a wide variety of uses.

===Input-output and socialist planning===
The input-output model is one of the major conceptual models for a [[socialist]] [[planned economy]]. This model involves the direct determination of physical quantities to be produced in each industry, which is used to formulate a consistent economic plan of resource allocation. This method of planning is contrasted with price-directed [[Lange model|Lange-model socialism]] and Soviet-style [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loucks|first1=William Negele|last2=Whitney|first2=William G.|title=Comparative Economic Systems|date=1973|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=9780060440459|pages=178–179|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economy of the [[Soviet Union]], planning was conducted using the method of material balances up until the country's dissolution. The method of material balances was first developed in the 1930s during the Soviet Union's rapid industrialization drive. Input-output planning was never adopted because the material balance system had become entrenched in the Soviet economy, and input-output planning was shunned for ideological reasons. As a result, the benefits of consistent and detailed planning through input-output analysis was never realized in the [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]].&lt;ref&gt;''Towards A New Socialism'', 1993, by Paul cockshott and Allin Cottrell. Coronet Books Inc. 978-0851245454. "Planning in the USSR", (P.79)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring input–output tables ==

The mathematics of input–output economics is straightforward, but the data requirements are enormous because the expenditures and revenues of each branch of economic activity have to be represented. As a result, not all countries collect the required data and data quality varies, even though a set of standards for the data's collection has been set out by the United Nations through its System of National Accounts (SNA):&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp About SNA], UN&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent standard is the 2008 SNA. Because the data collection and preparation process for the input–output accounts is necessarily labor and computer intensive, input–output tables are often published long after the year in which the data were collected—typically as much as 5–7 years after. Moreover, the economic "snapshot" that the benchmark version of the tables provides of the economy's cross-section is typically taken only once every few years, at best.

However, many developed countries estimate input–output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input–output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis from the perspective of most national statistical agencies is the [[benchmarking]] of [[gross domestic product]]. Input–output tables therefore are an instrumental part of [[national accounts]]. As suggested above, the core input–output table reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; indirect business taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called "gross product originating" or "gross domestic product by industry." Another array of column vectors is called "final demand" or "gross product consumed." This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input–output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.

==Input–output analysis versus consistency analysis==
Despite the clear ability of the input-output model to depict and analyze the dependence of one industry or sector on another, Leontief and others never managed to introduce the full spectrum of dependency relations in a market economy. In 2003, Mohammad Gani [https://web.archive.org/web/20070826172321/http://sb.iub.edu.bd/Dr_Mohammad_Osman_Gani.html], a pupil of Leontief, introduced [[consistency analysis]] in his book 'Foundations of Economic Science' ({{ISBN|984320655X}}), which formally looks exactly like the input–output table but explores the dependency relations in terms of payments and intermediation relations. Consistency analysis explores the consistency of plans of buyers and sellers by decomposing the input–output table into four matrices, each for a different kind of means of payment. It integrates micro and macroeconomics into one model and deals with money in a value-free manner. It deals with the flow of funds via the movement of goods.

In 2016, ''Mail Online'' was forced to pay £150,000 to a Muslim family whom Hopkins had falsely accused of [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] links. In a 2017 [[Defamation#England and Wales|libel]] case, Hopkins was required to pay £24,000 in [[damages]] and £107,000 in [[Costs in English law|legal costs]] to the left-wing writer [[Jack Monroe]] after making defamatory remarks on Twitter. Later in 2017, ''Mail Online'' was forced to pay substantial damages and legal costs to a teacher about whom Hopkins had made false claims.

==Early life and education==
Katie Hopkins was born on 13 February 1975,&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;''Index of Births, Marriages and Deaths in England and Wales, 1837–1983.''&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Barnstaple]], Devon.&lt;ref name=grigg/&gt; Her father was an [[electrical engineer]] for the local Electricity Board and her mother was a bank teller. She has an older sister. She was raised in [[Bideford]],&lt;ref name="Thring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bideford girl Katie Hopkins stars in Big Brother|url=http://www.northdevonjournal.co.uk/Bideford-girl-Katie-Hopkins-stars-Big-Brother/story-25853814-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=North Devon Journal|date=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504125014/http://www.northdevonjournal.co.uk/Bideford-girl-Katie-Hopkins-stars-Big-Brother/story-25853814-detail/story.html|archivedate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended a private [[convent school]] from age 3 to 16, played sports and learned to play the piano and violin. As a child she believed she was "going to be the colonel of the forces. I loved the military. I loved the discipline, the rigour, the big shouty men."&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/14/katie-hopkins-interview|title=Katie Hopkins interview: 'Can you imagine the pent-up rage?'|work=The Guardian|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins told [[Sathnam Sanghera]] of ''[[The Times]]'' in June 2015 that she applied to study [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. She passed the [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] entrance exam, but was rejected at the interview stage.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; Disappointed, and putting the failure down to an absence of "a bit of coaching", she instead studied economics at the [[University of Exeter]]. She felt that her time at university was "redeemed" by her sponsorship from the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]], and spent her weekends with the [[Officers' Training Corps]].&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; This she found "really fun, lying around in forests with guns having a brilliant time".&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

She completed her military training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], but suffered an [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]] during the final [[Passing out (military)|passing-out]] ceremony, and as a result was unable to take up her commission.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; Hopkins said she kept her epilepsy secret whilst attending Sandhurst as this would have prevented her from being commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katie Hopkins talking about her epilepsy|url=https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/news/katie-hopkins-talking-about-her-epilepsy|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=Epilepsy Today|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she joined a business consultancy and moved to [[Manhattan]], New York City, before returning to the UK in 2005.&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt; She joined the [[Met Office]] as a global brand consultant in September 2006.&lt;ref name=bbcmet/&gt;

==Television and radio==

===''The Apprentice''===
{{main article|The Apprentice (UK TV series)|l1=The Apprentice}}
Hopkins was allowed to take unpaid leave from her job from the Met Office as part of her probationary period of employment to take part in [[The Apprentice (UK series three)|series three]] of the reality TV show ''The Apprentice'' in 2006.&lt;ref name=bbcmet&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6743877.stm|title=Apprentice contender Katie fired|date=12 June 2007|accessdate=16 January 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the format used at that time, contestants in ''The Apprentice'' competed for a £100,000-a-year job working for the businessman [[Alan Sugar]].&lt;ref name=bbcmet/&gt; Hopkins rejected Sugar's offer of a place in the final episode of the programme, citing problems regarding childcare provision for her daughters, and withdrew from the competition at the end of the penultimate task.&lt;ref name=bbcmet/&gt;&lt;ref name=cochrane&gt;{{cite book|title=Women of the Revolution: Forty Years of Feminism|first=Kira|last=Cochrane|publisher=Guardian Books|year=2012|p=222|isbn=978-0-852-65262-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode gained 6.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers, while the following ''[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!|You're Fired]]!'' episode, in which Hopkins was interviewed, was watched by 3.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,2097470,00.html|title=The Apprentice beats Diana show|accessdate=15 June 2007|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her tenure on ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins made several critical comments on camera.

====Aftermath====
In June 2007, Hopkins lost her job at the Met Office, which said that she did not meet the required standards to complete her probationary period, and confirmed that her performance on ''The Apprentice'' and confessions about her private life were a factor in her dismissal.&lt;ref name="bbcmet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |title=Katie Hopkins fired from real job |accessdate=15 June 2007 |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155515/http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |archivedate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins later stated that the media were informed of her dismissal an hour after she was fired.&lt;ref name='GMTV'/&gt; After her appearance on ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins signed two deals to sell her story, one with the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper and the other with [[EMAP]], the company behind ''[[heat (magazine)|Heat]]'' and ''[[Grazia]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2097757,00.html|title=Apprentice star signs News of the World deal|accessdate=15 June 2007|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins said in an interview with [[BBC Radio Kent]] that she had great respect for Sugar, and that she believed she would have won the programme had she been in the final episode. She also said that the media's attitudes towards her did not affect her but did affect her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/realmedia/audio/kents_best/thursday.ram|title=Katie Hopkins BBC Radio Kent Interview |accessdate=15 June 2007|publisher=BBC Radio Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made a similar claim of hypothetical victory in an interview with Fiona Phillips on the morning of the final ''Apprentice'' episode, although Sugar had said that if she wanted to press on he would fire her, whoever she was competing with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Katie Hopkins Interview|series=[[GMTV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=13 June 2007|season=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins told [[BBC Radio 1]] that she had not yet ruled out a media career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6740000/newsid_6746800?redirect=6746827.stm&amp;news=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;prefs=1 |title=Radio 1 Newsbeat – Katie Hopkins Interview |accessdate=15 June 2007 |publisher=BBC Radio 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but expressed interest in starting a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2007/06/13/katie_hopkins_apprentice_feature.shtml |title=What Katie did next... |accessdate=14 June 2007|publisher=BBC Berkshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasting work===
After ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins appeared in an episode of ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', and was a guest star on ''[[Loose Women]]'' and ''[[The Friday Night Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/F/fnp/episodes/s5_ep4.html|title=Show Four: Melanie C |accessdate=7 August 2007|publisher=Channel 4}}{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she presented a ''Five Live Report'' on family life and working mothers for [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and contributed an article on the same subject to [[BBC Online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Hopkins |title=Gateway to the world feels just like a parish hall |url=http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=136993&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=244961&amp;contentPK=17892541&amp;folderPk=113914&amp;pNodeId=244962 |publisher=Express and Echo |page=1 |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2007 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins has appeared twice on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in the editions of 10 June 2010 and 27 January 2011.

In 2015, she deliberately gained and lost weight over the course of several months, in an attempt to show that obese people can diet successfully. Her progress was carefully documented by a camera crew and then played on a programme called ''My Fat Story'' for [[TLC (UK and Ireland)|TLC]].&lt;ref name=grigg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11317274/Katie-Hopkins-what-fat-people-need-is-a-kick-up-the-a-.html|title=Hopkins: what fat people need is a kick up the a--|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 January 2015|first=Casilda|last=Grigg|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins gained and lost {{convert|3|st|lb kg}} over the course of the programme.&lt;ref name=Lockhart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11316692/Katie-Hopkins-Im-still-the-biggest-bitch-in-Britain.html|title=Katie Hopkins: 'I'm still the biggest bitch in Britain'|first=Keely|last=Lockhart|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TLC claimed an audience figure of 10 million in the UK and US for the programme.&lt;ref name="Sweney181215"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/18/katie-hopkins-tv-chat-show-axed|title=Katie Hopkins' TV chatshow axed|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, she began her own chat show, ''[[If Katie Hopkins Ruled the World]]'' on the digital channel [[TLC (UK and Ireland)|TLC]]. She said she wanted to bring a new variation to chat and panel shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/06/if-katie-hopkins-ruled-the-world-tv-show-daily-mail-liz-jones|title=Katie Hopkins' TV show: 'I’m not playing the part of a pantomime villain’|first=Tara|last=Conlan|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was dropped in December, after the first series, owing to low audience ratings.&lt;ref name="Sweney181215"/&gt;

Hopkins said she is "pushing back the walls closing in on freedom of speech" at a Church and Media conference in October 2015. Claiming to be "the new Jesus" during her speech, she said: "I have never apologised for anything I’ve said. I find it very disappointing when people apologise.

===Print and websites===
Early in her public career, Hopkins wrote a column for Exeter's ''[[Express &amp; Echo]]'' newspaper, but her articles ceased after an online poll in October 2007 found 84% of readers wanted the feature to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7037846.stm|title=Apprentice Katie is 'fired' again|publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2007|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 2013, it emerged that Hopkins had joined ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' as a weekly columnist.&lt;ref name="Guardian311013"/&gt; with the newspaper promoting her as "Britain's most controversial columnist".&lt;ref name="Dearden010815"/&gt; Hopkins in February 2015 defended her remarks and those of her critics, commenting: "I welcome it because I've had my opinion and it's only right that people have theirs.

Since ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins has frequently featured in the media for making controversial remarks, being described in several media outlets as a "professional [[internet troll|troll]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/19/friday-2-januarys-best-tv|title=Friday 2nd January's Best TV|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/02/katie-hopkins-gets-slayed-twitter-x-factor-stereo-kicks-singer-tom-mann_n_6253542.html|title=Katie Hopkins Gets Slayed on Twitter By X Factor Stereo Kicks Singer Tom Mann|work=HuffPost|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/stereo-kicks/news/stereo-kicks-burn-katie-hopkins-on-twitter|title=Stereo Kicks Burn Katie Hopkins on Twitter|publisher=MTV|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described herself as a "conduit for truth", declaring what other people think but are too scared to say.&lt;ref name="Usborne2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Usborne|first=Simon|title=A day with Katie Hopkins: Separating the Apprentice 'superbitch' from her soundbites|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/a-day-with-katie-hopkins-separating-the-apprentice-superbitch-from-her-soundbites-8706555.html|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Independent|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class===
During an appearance on [[ITV Network|ITV's]] ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' in July 2013, Hopkins revealed she would stop her children playing with their classmates based on their [[given name]]s. She revealed a particular dislike for "lower class" names like Charmaine, Chantelle, and [[Chardonnay (name)|Chardonnay]], which met with disapproval from co-host [[Holly Willoughby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallwork|first=Ellen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/30/holly-willoughby-baby-name-katie-hopkins-teases-they-clearly-had-sex-in-chester_n_7321976.html|title=Holly Willoughby Baby Name: Katie Hopkins Teases 'They Clearly Had Sex In Chester'|work=HuffPost|date=30 September 2014|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins said that she did not like "geographical location names" either.

Appearing as a panellist on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[The Big Benefits Row: Live]]'' in February 2014, she was accused by [[Terry Christian]] amongst others of only expressing her controversial opinions to make money from media appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/04/katie-hopkins-annabel-giles-the-big-benefits-row-channel-5_n_4721468.html|title=Katie Hopkins Comes To Blows With Annabel Giles On 'The Big Benefits Row'|work=Huffington Post|date=4 February 2014|first=Ashley|last=Percival|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins has said that financial motives are not the reason she speaks out, and received a "relatively modest" fee of £300 when she was on ''This Morning'' speaking about children's names.&lt;ref name="Usborne2014"/&gt;

In a February 2014 interview with [[Decca Aitkenhead]] for ''The Guardian'', Hopkins was asked if she is a snob: "Oh, definitely yeah, 100%. I think it's really important to be snobby".&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

===Illness and fatalities in the UK===
Hopkins posted a tweet referring to Scottish [[life expectancy]] predictions based upon a 2011 [[NHS Scotland]] report, "Healthy Life Expectancy in Scotland: Update of trends to 2010". This tweet was posted following a heated debate on Scottish Independence during an edition of  ''[[The Wright Stuff]]'' on which Hopkins was a panellist. In the wake of the [[2013 Glasgow helicopter crash]], the tweet raised widespread condemnation among Twitter users. Hopkins retorted "Following Independence I will only be the Biggest Bitch in England", and described people's reactions as "[[political correctness|PC]] tastic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/02/katie-hopkins-twitter-glasgow-helicopter-crash-apprentice|title=Katie Hopkins apologises for timing of tweet about Scottish life expectancy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition to ban Hopkins from shows such as ITV's ''This Morning'' and ''The Wright Stuff'' on Channel 5 gained over 75,000 signatures.

On 31 December 2014, police announced they were investigating complaints they had received concerning Hopkins' tweets about [[Ebola virus disease in the United Kingdom#2014 returning aid worker|Pauline Cafferkey]], a Scottish aid worker who was diagnosed with [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] after returning to the UK from [[Sierra Leone]].

===Pakistani men and Rochdale===
Hopkins objected to Rochdale commemorating National Pakistan Day on 23 March 2015 and claimed to base her objection on a [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang|Rochdale sex trafficking case]] involving nine predominantly Pakistani men and forty-seven white victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/29/katie-hopkins-reported-police-race-hate-rochdale-pakistani-sex-abuse|title=Katie Hopkins accused of race hate by linking Pakistani men with sex abuse|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of tweets, she posted images of the felons with the caption "are these your friends too?"

===Migrants===
On 17 April 2015, Hopkins wrote a column in ''The Sun'' in  comparing migrants to "cockroaches" and "feral humans" and said they were "spreading like the norovirus". She wrote that gunships should be used to stop migrants from crossing the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/20/katie-hopkins-sun-migrants-article-petition-nears-180000-mark|title=Katie Hopkins compares migrants to 'cockroaches' and suggests using gunships to stop them crossing the Mediterranean|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV180415"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-18/katie-hopkins-compares-migrants-to-cockroaches-and-suggests-using-gunships-to-stop-them-crossing-the-mediterranean/|title=Katie Hopkins compares migrants to 'cockroaches' and suggests using gunships to stop them crossing the Mediterranean|publisher=[[ITV News]]|date=18 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gander"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gander|first=Kashmira|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hateful-katie-hopkins-column-on-migrants-causes-twitter-backlash-as-russell-brand-wades-into-debate-10186342.html|title='Hateful' Katie Hopkins column on migrants causes Twitter backlash, as Russell Brand wades into debate|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remarks were condemned by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commission for Human Rights]], [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]].&lt;ref name="Stone240415"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Jon|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/katie-hopkins-migrant-cockroaches-column-resembles-progenocide-propaganda-says-the-un-10201959.html|title=Katie Hopkins' migrant 'cockroaches' column resembles pro-genocide propaganda, says the UN|work=The Independent|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released on 24 April 2015, he urged the UK to "curb incitement to hatred" by its "tabloid newspapers" and stated that Hopkins used "language very similar to that employed by Rwanda's ''[[Kangura]]'' newspaper and [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|Radio Mille Collines]] during the run up to the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide]]", and noted that both media organisations were subsequently convicted by an international tribunal of public incitement to commit [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="Stone240415"/&gt;

Hopkins' column also drew criticism on Twitter, including from [[Russell Brand]], to whom Hopkins responded by accusing Brand's "[[champagne socialist]] humanity" of neglecting taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Gander"/&gt; Simon Usborne, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', compared her use of the word "cockroach" to previous uses by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and just before the [[Rwandan Genocide]] by its perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Usborne2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/katie-hopkins-when-is-enough-enough-10186490.html|title=Katie Hopkins has just written a piece so hateful that it might give Hitler pause – why was it published?|work=The Independent|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece it would not have been published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Usborne2015"/&gt; [[Zoe Williams]] commented in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "It is no joke when people start talking like this.

A [[Change.org]] petition was initiated with the aim of getting ''The Sun'' to sack Hopkins.

The tweet was pulled after the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] publicly announced Britain would do more to help those seeking asylum in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/sep/03/why-did-sun-delete-katie-hopkins-gunships-to-stop-migrants-tweet|title=Why did Sun delete Katie Hopkins 'Gunships to stop migrants' tweet?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 September 2015|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further Change.org petition for Hopkins to be replaced with 50,000 Syrian refugees gained more than 20,000 signatures in less than 48 hours in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ben Fletcher|title=Swap Katie Hopkins for 50,000 Refugees|publisher=[[change.org]]|accessdate=6 September 2015|location=Tickhill, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/someone-set-up-a-petition-to-swap-katie-hopkins-with-50000-syrian-refugees--Z1qRC1eirl|title=Someone set up a petition to swap Katie Hopkins with 50,000 Syrian refugees|work=i100|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/05/swap-katie-hopkins-for-50000-refugees-petition_n_8093854.html?1441479098&amp;ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067|title=Swap Katie Hopkins For 50,000 Refugees Petition Sees 20,000 Signatures in Just Over A Day|work=The Huffington Post UK|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/petition-launched-to-swap-katie-hopkins-for-50000-syrian-refugees-a2927656.html|title=Petition launched to swap Katie Hopkins for 50,000 Syrian refugees|author=Tom Marshall|date=5 September 2015|work=London Evening Standard|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Herbert, chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, reported Hopkins and ''The Sun'' to Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] Commissioner. Hopkins was questioned and not charged, and subsequently criticised the police for purportedly criminalising opinion, and stated that she would set up a Society of White Lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Katie Hopkins tweets about 'setting up society for white lawyers' after Met Police decide against charging her over allegations of inciting racial hatred|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-tweets-about-setting-up-society-for-white-lawyers-after-met-police-decide-against-a6720436.html|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2016, the original article had been removed from ''The Sun''{{'}}s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://politicalscrapbook.net/2016/12/the-sun-deletes-katie-hopkins-article-calling-refugees-cockroaches-after-stop-funding-hate-campaign/|title=''The Sun'' Deletes Katie Hopkins' Article Calling Refugees 'Cockroaches' After Stop Funding Hate Campaign|work=Political Scrapbook|date=14 December 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Hopkins supported [[Donald Trump]]'s Republican presidential nomination in the ''Daily Mail'' during December: "I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, {{sic|imaging}} the two of us shouting naked at the rain. It's because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2015/12/world-ends-donald-trump-discovers-respected-columnist-katie-hopkins-supports|title=World ends as Donald Trump discovers 'respected columnist' Katie Hopkins supports him|work=New Statesman|date=10 December 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins defended Trump's [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump#Proposed Muslim immigration ban|remarks that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States]].

When Neil pointed out there could be no legal problems with identifying an area she continued to refuse, saying only “I know those places exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodfellow|first=Mollie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-no-go-areas-non-muslims-in-andrew-neil-bbc-daily-politics-interview-legally-accurate-a6769516.html|title=Katie Hopkins admits she cannot name 'no-go' areas for non-Muslims in Andrew Neil BBC Daily Politics interview|work=The Independent|date=11 December 2015|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism, racial profiling, and Black Lives Matter===
In January 2017, a caller to her LBC programme named Joseph said she came over as racist, following which she said: "I genuinely believe 'racist' as a word has been used so much. I am sorry for the word racist in a way. I love language so much&amp;nbsp;... it's like a regular word now, it's lost all meaning to me". When tweeting the clip she added, "Call me racist. I don't care. I will stand up for white women being raped because you're scared to offend Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Mark|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/outrage-as-katie-hopkins-shares-neonazi-praise-after-racism-debate-a3430926.html|title=Outrage as Katie Hopkins shares neo-Nazi praise after 'racism' debate|work=London Evening Standard|date=2 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins tweeted shortly afterwards: "Racial profiling is a good thing, call me racist. I don't care...it has lost all meaning". She later briefly retweeted a favourable response from an account named Anti Juden SS, whose avatar featured the [[Nazi swastika|Swastika]] (and the United States flag), later explaining that she had not looked at the handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Demianyk|first=Graeme|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/katie-hopkins-tweet-racist-neo-nazi_uk_586a91a3e4b0f24da6e93af7|title=Katie Hopkins Shares 'Neo-Nazi' Praise After Claiming 'Racism Has Lost All Meaning'|work=HuffPost|date=3 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}} The ellipsis is in Hopkins' original tweet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Tanya|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/press-regulation-will-be-a-boon-to-anti-journalists-like-katie-hopkins/#|title=Press regulation will be a boon to anti-journalists like Katie Hopkins|work=The Spectator|date=7 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing a poster on Twitter for the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'' at the beginning of May 2017, Hopkins added: "Dear black people. If your lives matter why do you stab and shoot each other so much". Although, the tweet was deleted, users of the social media site circulated screenshots of what appeared to be a reference to the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolworthy|first=Jacob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/katie-hopkins-dear-white-people-netflix-series-black-lives-matter-racist-tweet-a7713646.html|title=Katie Hopkins accused of racism after Dear White People tweet|work=The Independent|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, she urged the London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] to use [[Water cannon#United Kingdom|water cannon]] against Black Lives Matter protesters at [[Heathrow Airport]], who had chained themselves to the tarmac of an approach road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Mark|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/black-lives-matter-katie-hopkins-causes-outrage-after-calling-for-water-cannon-to-be-used-against-a3313331.html|title=Black Lives Matter: Katie Hopkins causes outrage after calling for water cannon to be used against Heathrow protesters|work=London Evening Standard|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018 Hopkins was detained and had her passport briefly confiscated in South Africa for allegedly spreading racial hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/24/katie-hopkins-wins-complaint-against-mirror-for-ketamine-headline|title=Katie Hopkins wins complaint against Mirror for ketamine headline|first=Jim|last=Waterson Media|date=24 May 2018|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor}}Manchester Arena bombing===
Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins wrote that "Britain is faced with some hard questions the people charged with protecting us are going to have to answer sooner or later". Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya.  "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," wrote Hopkins, "and then expect us to swallow their lies that we will not give in to terror?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hopkins | first = Katie | date = 24 May 2017 | title = The Politicians Now Have Hundreds of Troops Protecting Them While Telling The Rest of Us To Keep Calm, Stay 'United' And Carry On.

The journalist [[Nick Cohen]] was among those who responded on Twitter: "Even if Hopkins knows nothing of Nazism – which I doubt – her "final solution" can only mean [[ethnic cleansing]]". Others, such as [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]], called for a boycott of the LBC radio station while they employ her.&lt;ref name="Nelson230517"/&gt; Interviewed later on Fox News by [[Tucker Carlson]], she called for people to insist on deportations among other responses to terrorist acts. She said: "I used the word 'final solution' in a tweet, and I would not in any way want to use that term and the inference other people lay on that. What I meant was, we need a lasting solution, a resolution to this".&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;&lt;!-- Main passage on her LBC sacking is in 'Subsequent broadcasting work'.

Following the [[2017 London Bridge attack|June 2017 London Bridge attack]] almost a fortnight later, Hopkins called for [[internment|internment camps]] to be used for those suspected of being Muslim extremists on Fox News' ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]''. The host [[Clayton Morris]] said, on behalf of the network staff, that everyone considered the "idea reprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Karl|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/fox-news-distances-itself-from-farage-and-hopkins-internment-demands-1-4466308?fff|title=Fox News distances itself from Farage and Hopkins internment demands|work=The Scotsman|agency=Inews|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fang|first=Marina|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-london-attack_us_59343347e4b075bff0f475f8|title=Fox News Host Disavows Internment Camps, After Panelists Suggest Rounding Up Muslims|work=HuffPost|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fox-news-katie-hopkins-internment-camp-london-attack-terror-stabbing-muslims-islam-a7775026.html|title=Fox News calls Katie Hopkins' internment camp remarks 'reprehensible'|work=The Independent|date=6 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins' comments have been linked in the media with [[hate crimes]] against Muslims. A Muslim man in [[Heckmondwike]] stated that he was attacked by assailants who graffitied his house with Hopkins' tweet, including her misspelling "#Machester".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finnegan|first1=Stephanie|title=Muslim man attacked by thugs who then vandalised his home quoting a racist Katie Hopkins tweet|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/muslim-man-attacked-thugs-who-13237258|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean===
In July 2017, Hopkins flew to [[Catania]] in Sicily to visit a ship known as the C-Star hired by the [[Identitarian movement#In Europe|Defend Europe]] movement, which has the intention of hindering the work of "search and rescue" vessels in the Mediterranean used by charities such as [[Save the Children]] to save trafficked migrants and refugees.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheimn|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-defend-europe-meeting-far-right-activists-c-star-ship-anti-immigrant-mediterranean-a7857911.html|title=Katie Hopkins branded 'PR machine for extremists' after meeting group aiming to hamper refugee rescues in Med|work=The Independent|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defend Europe is supported by the American white-nationalist [[David Duke]] and the neo-Nazi ''[[The Daily Stormer|Daily Stormer]]'' website.&lt;ref name="Mulhall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulhall|first=Joe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/21/katie-hopkins-boat-far-right-activists-sicily-migrants|title=Why has Katie Hopkins set sail with a bunch of far-right activists?|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins tweets suggested she was actively supporting Defend Europe, rather than covering the subject for her employer: "Looking forward to meeting the crew of the C-Star in Catania tomorrow.

An article headlined "Katie Hopkins on NGOs colluding with traffickers in Sicily" was briefly published on the ''Mailonline'' website in mid-July 2017.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"/&gt; According to a report on the ''[[HuffPo]]'' website, the article offered no evidence to match the title. Shortly after her article was deleted, Save the Children rejected Hopkins' claim that she had "spent time" with the crew of one of their ships. "Nor will she set sail with us on any of our rescue missions", they stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=York|first=Chris|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/katie-hopkins_uk_596f4a08e4b00db3d0f46e11|title=Katie Hopkins in Row With Save The Children As MailOnline Article Mysteriously Disappears|work=HuffPo|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deleted ''Mailonline'' article was her only contribution to the planned series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anglesey|first=Steve|url=http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/brexfactor-katie-hopkins-words-of-hate-are-lost-at-sea-1-5125518|title=Brexfactor: Katie Hopkins’ words of hate are lost at sea|work=The New European|date=28 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cooking|Cookery]] writer and anti-poverty campaigner, [[Jack Monroe]] threatened a [[English defamation law|libel action]] against Katie Hopkins after Hopkins accused Monroe of [[vandalism]] to a [[war memorial]], having confused Monroe with journalist [[Laurie Penny]], who had written in support of that vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Sara C.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/02/jack-monroes-lawyer-says-katie-hopkins-friday-apologise_n_7492886.html|title=Jack Monroe's Lawyer Says Katie Hopkins Has Until Friday To Apologise|work=HuffPost|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe called for an apology and a £5,000 donation to a migrants rescue charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-and-jack-monroe-embroiled-in-twitter-row-as-the-cook-threatens-to-sue-the-columnist-10260002.html|title=Katie Hopkins and Jack Monroe embroiled in Twitter row as the cook threatens to sue the columnist|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closeronline.co.uk/2015/06/public-apology-and-5k-to-migrant-rescue-or-else-jack-monroe-to-take-katie-hopkins-down|title="Public apology and £5K to migrant rescue – or else!": Jack Monroe to take Katie Hopkins down?|author=Kayleigh Dray|work=Closer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins later admitted that she was mistaken about the identity but did not apologise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/ashley-davies-sorry-seems-to-be-the-hardest-word-1-3791980|title=Sorry seems to be the hardest word|first=Ashley|last=Davies|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe began legal action in January 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinson|first=Jane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/18/katie-hopkins-jack-monroe-mail-online|title=Katie Hopkins sued by Jack Monroe over vandalism accusation|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 January 2016|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Huffington Post]]'' 19 January 2016 [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/18/katie-hopkins-sued-by-jack-monroe_n_9008620.html Jack Monroe Sues Katie Hopkins Over War Memorial Vandalism Twitter Mixup]&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded £24,000 in damages and £107,000 in legal costs in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39234079|title=Jack Monroe wins Katie Hopkins libel tweet case|publisher=BBC News|date=10 March 2017|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/10/jack-monroe-wins-twitter-libel-case-against-katie-hopkins|title=Jack Monroe wins Twitter libel case against Katie Hopkins|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|date=10 March 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the decision became known, Hopkins tweeted an image of herself as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] and commented that she saw herself as "the Jesus of the outspoken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Sara C.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jack-monroe-feels-nothing-but-compassion-and-sympathy-for-katie-hopkins-after-court-victory_uk_58c7ccf4e4b081a56def3678|title=Jack Monroe Feels Nothing But 'Compassion And Sympathy' For Katie Hopkins After Court Victory|work=HuffPost|date=14 March 2017|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal application was refused in January 2018 as it was considered unlikely to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-libel-case-appeal-lose-jack-monroe-food-blogger-daily-mail-sun-a8155661.html|title=Katie Hopkins appeal refused after losing libel case to food writer Jack Monroe|work=The Independent|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahmood family===
Mohammad Tariq Mahmood, his brother and their children were stopped from boarding a [[Norwegian Air Shuttle|Norwegian Air]] flight from [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] to Los Angeles on 15 December 2015. At the airport, the family from Walthamstow found their entry visas to the United States had been cancelled.&lt;ref name="Dearden241215"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dearden|first=Lizzie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-congratulates-homeland-security-staff-who-stopped-british-muslim-familys-holiday-to-a6785076.html|title=Katie Hopkins congratulates Homeland Security staff who stopped British Muslim family's Disneyland holiday|work=The Independent|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] settled a libel case brought by the Mahmood family with £150,000 damages, plus legal costs, over two articles by Hopkins posted on the Mailonline website which claimed members of the Muslim family were extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38367563|title=Katie Hopkins apologises to family over al-Qaeda claims|publisher=BBC News|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV191216"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-12-19/mailonline-forced-to-pay-out-150k-over-libellous-katie-hopkins-column/|title=MailOnline forced to pay out £150k over libellous Katie Hopkins column|publisher=ITV News|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columns published at the time of the incident falsely claimed that officials were right to stop the family flying to Los Angeles to visit [[Disneyland]] because the two men were connected to [[Al-Qaeda|al-Qaida]], and that their stated plans were a "lie".&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/19/mail-pays-out-150k-to-muslim-family-over-katie-hopkins-column|title=Mail pays out £150k to Muslim family over Katie Hopkins column|work=The Guardian|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the settlement, the assertions from the Mahmood family were accepted as true by the ''Mail'' and Hopkins; the family had arranged to stay with another brother living in California,&lt;ref name="ITV191216"/&gt; The family's MP, [[Stella Creasy]], complained to the prime minister [[David Cameron]] at the time about the family's treatment, but Hopkins said Creasy was  a "whinging…blond-bobbed maniac".&lt;ref name="Dearden241215"/&gt;

In a statement from the family's solicitors, [[Carter-Ruck]], they said: "matters are not helped when sensationalist and, frankly, Islamophobic articles such as this are published, and which caused us all a great deal of distress and anxiety. We are very pleased that the record has been set straight".&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Olivia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-twitter-apology-muslim-family-extremism-links-mail-online-column-a7484436.html|title=Katie Hopkins tweets apology to Muslim family she linked to extremists – at 2&amp;nbsp;am|work=The Independent|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two articles by Hopkins about the Mahmood family have been removed from the Mailonline website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowden|first=George|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/katie-hopkins-apologises_uk_5857b020e4b0e9baa877e873|title=Katie Hopkins Issues Extraordinary Apology To Muslim Family After Mail Online Columns|work=HuffPost|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/19/mail-pays-out-150k-to-muslim-family-over-katie-hopkins-column|title=Mail pays out £150,000 to Muslim family over Katie Hopkins column|first=Jasper|last=Jackson|date=19 December 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackie Teale===

In November 2017, Hopkins' former employers [[Mail Online]] apologised and paid "substantial damages" to teacher Jackie Teale, after Hopkins had made false accusations of taking her class to a [[Donald Trump]] protest in Westminster.&lt;ref name="Ruddick281117"/&gt;

===Daily Mirror===

In May 2018, Hopkins won an [[Independent Press Standards Organisation|IPSO]] case against the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for claiming that she had been detained in South Africa in February 2018 for taking [[ketamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|last=Embury-Dennis|first=Tom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-daily-mirror-south-africa-headline-drug-racism-ipso-complaint-a8367581.html|title=Katie Hopkins wins IPSO case against Daily Mirror for claiming she was detained for drugs rather than 'spreading racial hatred'|work=The Independent|date=25 May 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mirror'' updated the headline to say that she had been detained for spreading racial hatred, and included a correction in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Emmeline|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-detained-south-africa-11977548|title=Katie Hopkins DETAINED in South Africa for 'spreading racial hatred' after taking ketamine while collapsed in the street|work=The Mirror|date=6 February 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament Election]], Hopkins stood as a candidate for the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England Constituency]] as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate. She polled 8,971 votes or 0.6% of the total votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_36.stm |title=European Election 2009 &amp;#124; South West |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apprentice villain Katie Hopkins standing for Euro election|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Apprentice-villain-Katie-Hopkins-standing-Euro-election/story-12300046-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=Western Daily Press|date=11 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111180920/http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Apprentice-villain-Katie-Hopkins-standing-Euro-election/story-12300046-detail/story.html|archivedate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2015, Hopkins spoke at a fringe event organised by the [[Electoral Reform Society]] at the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP)'s annual conference. After derogatory comments about the appointment of [[Michelle Mone]] to the [[House of Lords]], she said: "Frankly, I don't really mind if we seal up the room and gas the lot of them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/25/katie-hopkins-wouldnt-mind-if-house-of-lords-was-sealed-up-and-gassed|title=Katie Hopkins 'wouldn't mind' if House of Lords was sealed up and gassed|work=The Guardian|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UKIP said Hopkins was not a party member and, although she has reportedly applied to join on several occasions, her applications have always been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payne|first=Sebastian|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/09/watch-ukip-supporter-katie-hopkins-advocates-gassing-the-house-of-lords/|title=Watch: Ukip supporter Katie Hopkins advocates gassing the House of Lords|work=The Spectator (Coffee House blog)|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, students at [[Brunel University]] turned their backs on her, then walked out in protest at her presence in a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/nov/26/katie-hopkins-brunel-university-students-turn-backs-video|title=The moment students turned their backs on Katie Hopkins' hate speech|date=26 November 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hopkins' first husband was Damian McKinney, a former [[Royal Marine]] and founder and Chief Executive of the company McKinney Rogers; they married in September 2004 in Exeter.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt; He was married to another woman when they first met; she has admitted to having [[adultery|"stolen" him]].&lt;ref name="Thring"/&gt; McKinney left Hopkins for another woman soon after the birth of the couple's second daughter.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanghera|first=Sathnam|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/magazine/article4471465.ece|title=Katie Hopkins – bigmouth strikes again|work=The Times magazine|date=20 June 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at the Met Office, she met Mark Cross, a married design manager.

Hopkins formerly suffered from [[epilepsy]]; she was being hospitalised around once every 10 days in early 2014, she told Decca Aitkenhead: "When I have a fit at night, my arms come out.

The '''Kerr–Newman metric''' is a solution of the [[Einstein's field equation#Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell equations]] in [[general relativity]] that describes the spacetime geometry in the region surrounding a charged, rotating mass. This solution has not been especially useful for describing astrophysical phenomena, because observed astronomical objects do not possess an appreciable net [[electric charge]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The solution has instead been of primarily theoretical and mathematical interest. (It is assumed that the [[cosmological constant]] equals zero.)

==History==
In 1965, [[Ezra T. Newman|Ezra "Ted" Newman]] found the axisymmetric solution of Einstein's field equation for a black hole which is both rotating and electrically charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Ezra |last2=Janis |first2=Allen |title=Note on the Kerr Spinning-Particle Metric |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Physics]] |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=915–917 |date=1965 |doi=10.1063/1.1704350 |bibcode = 1965JMP.....6..915N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Ezra |last2=Couch |first2=E. |last3=Chinnapared |first3=K. |last4=Exton |first4=A. |last5=Prakash |first5=A. |last6=Torrence |first6=R. |title=Metric of a Rotating, Charged Mass |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=918–919 |date=1965 |doi=10.1063/1.1704351 |bibcode = 1965JMP.....6..918N }}&lt;/ref&gt; This formula for the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} \!&lt;/math&gt; is called the Kerr–Newman metric. It is a generalisation of the [[Kerr metric]] for an uncharged spinning point-mass, which had been discovered by [[Roy Kerr]] two years earlier.&lt;ref name="kerr_1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kerr | first = RP | authorlink = Roy Kerr | date = 1963 | title = Gravitational field of a spinning mass as an example of algebraically special metrics | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 11 | pages = 237–238 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.237 | bibcode=1963PhRvL..11..237K | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v11/i5/p237_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto"
| 
| Non-rotating (''J'' = 0)
| Rotating (''J'' ≠ 0)
|- 
| Uncharged (''Q'' = 0)
| [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]
| [[Kerr metric|Kerr]]
|-
| Charged (''Q'' ≠ 0)
| [[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner–Nordström]]
| Kerr–Newman 
|}

where ''Q'' represents the body's [[electric charge]] and ''J'' represents its spin [[angular momentum]].

==Mathematical form==
The Kerr–Newman metric describes the geometry of [[spacetime]] for a rotating charged black hole with mass ''M'', charge ''Q'' and angular momentum ''J''. The formula for this metric depends upon what coordinates or [[coordinate conditions]] are selected.  One way to express this metric is by writing down its [[line element]] in a particular set of [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]],&lt;ref&gt;Hajicek, Petr et al.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=1vEe-8ktTJsC&amp;pg=PA243 An Introduction to the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation], page 243 (Springer 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Boyer–Lindquist coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;c^{2} d\tau^{2} = 
-\left(\frac{dr^2}{\Delta} + d\theta^2 \right) \rho^2 + \left(c \, dt - a \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi \right)^2 \frac{\Delta}{\rho^2} - \left(\left(r^2 + a^2 \right) d\phi - a c\, dt \right)^2 \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\rho^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where the coordinates (''r'', ''θ'', ''ϕ'') are standard [[oblate spheroidal coordinate system]], and the length-scales:

:&lt;math&gt;
a = \frac{J}{Mc}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ \rho^{2}=r^2+a^2\cos^2\theta\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ \Delta=r^2-r_sr+a^2+r_Q^2\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

have been introduced for brevity. Here ''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the massive body, which is related to its total mass-equivalent ''M'' by

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{s} = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt; is a length-scale corresponding to the [[electric charge]] ''Q'' of the mass

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{Q}^{2} = \frac{Q^{2}G}{4\pi\epsilon_{0} c^{4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 1/(4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's force constant]].

The total mass-equivalent ''M'', which also contains the [[Electric potential energy|electric field-energy]] and the [[rotational energy]], and the irreducible mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt; are related by&lt;ref&gt;[[Thibault Damour]]: [http://lapth.cnrs.fr/pg-nomin/chardon/IRAP_PhD/BlackHolesNice2012.pdf#page=11 Black Holes: Energetics and Thermodynamics], page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parthapratim Pradhan: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7126.pdf#page=9 Black Hole Interior Mass Formula], page 9, Eq. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm irr} = \frac{\sqrt{2 M^2-r^2_Q c^4/G^2+2 M \sqrt{M^2-(r^2_Q +a^2) c^4/G^2}}}{2} \ \to \ M=\sqrt{\frac{16 M_{\rm irr}^4+8 M_{\rm irr}^2 \ r^2_Q c^4/G^2+r^4_Q c^8/G^4}{16 M_{\rm irr}^2-4a^2 c^4/G^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to electrically charge and/or spin a neutral and static body, energy has to be applied to the system. Due to the [[mass–energy equivalence]], this energy also has a mass-equivalent; therefore ''M'' is always higher than ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;. If for example the rotational energy of a black hole is extracted via the [[Penrose process]]es&lt;ref name="mtw"&gt;[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne|Kip S. Thorne]], [[John Archibald Wheeler|John. A. Wheeler]]: ''[https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/03/21/gravitation-misner-thorne-wheeler/ Gravitation]'', pages 877 &amp; 908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;Bhat, Dhurandhar &amp; Dadhich: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02715080 Energetics of the Kerr–Newman Black Hole by the Penrose Process], page 94 ([http://1oJcZf PDF]: page 11)&lt;/ref&gt;, the remaining mass-energy will always stay greater than or equal to ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Component form===
The components of the Kerr–Newman metric can be read off after a simple algebraic re-arrangement:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c^{2} d\tau^{2} &amp; = \frac{(\Delta - a^2 \sin^2 \theta)}{\rho^2} \; c^2 \; dt^2 - \left(\frac{\rho^2}{\Delta} \right) dr^2  \\

&amp; - \rho^2 d\theta^2 + (a^2 \Delta \sin^2 \theta - r^4 - 2 r^2 a^2 - a^4) \frac{\sin^2 \theta \; d\phi^2}{\rho^2} \\
&amp; - (\Delta - r^2 - a^2) \frac{2 a \sin^2 \theta \; c \; dt \; d\phi}{\rho^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic field tensor===
The electromagnetic potential in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates is&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Carter: ''[https://luth.obspm.fr/~luthier/carter/trav/Carter68.pdf#page=3 Global structure of the Kerr family of gravitational fields]'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luongo"&gt;Orlando Luongo, Hernando Quevedo: ''[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1530.pdf#page=2 Characterizing repulsive gravity with curvature eigenvalues]''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu}=\left( \frac{r \ r_Q }{\rho^2},0,0,-\frac{c^2 \ a \ r \ r_Q  \sin ^2 \theta }{\rho^2 \ G \ M} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

while the Maxwell-tensor is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\partial A_\nu}{\partial x^{\mu}} - \frac{\partial A_\mu}{\partial x^{\nu}} \ \to \ F^{\mu\nu}=g^{\mu\sigma} \ g^{\nu\kappa} \ F_{\sigma \kappa}&lt;/math&gt;

In combination with the [[Christoffel symbols]] the second order [[Kerr–Newman_metric#Equations_of_motion|equations of motion]] can be derived with

:&lt;math&gt;{{\ddot x^i = - \Gamma^i_{j k} \ {\dot x^j} \ {\dot x^k} + q \ {F^{i k}} \ {\dot x^j}} \ {g_{j k}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge per mass of the testparticle.

===Alternative (Kerr–Schild) formulation===
The Kerr–Newman metric can be expressed in "Kerr–Schild" form, using a particular set of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as follows.&lt;ref name="Debney"&gt;Debney, G. et al.  [http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 "Solutions of the Einstein and Einstein–Maxwell Equations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223203626/http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 |date=2013-02-23 }} ''Journal of Mathematical Physics'', Volume 10, page 1842 (1969).  Especially see equations (7.10), (7.11) and (7.14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balasin, Herbert and Nachbagauer, Herbert.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9312028v1 “Distributional Energy-Momentum Tensor of the Kerr–Newman Space-Time Family.”]  (Arxiv.org 1993), subsequently published in ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'', volume 11, pages 1453–1461, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=4105419 abstract] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marcelo.  “Energy of Black Holes and Hawking’s Universe” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DGwYf8cOCq4C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22Kerr-Newman%22+and+cartesian&amp;ei=zR5cSY6EC4KEzgTUwZCQDg#PPA149,M1 Trends in Black Hole Research]'', page 148 (Kreitler ed., Nova Publishers 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; These solutions were proposed by [[Roy Patrick Kerr|Kerr]] and [[Alfred Schild|Schild]] in 1965.

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + fk_{\mu}k_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{Gr^2}{r^4 + a^2z^2}\left[2Mr - Q^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = ( k_{x} ,k_{y} ,k_{z} ) = \left( \frac{rx+ay}{r^2 + a^2} , \frac{ry-ax}{r^2 + a^2}, \frac{z}{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{0} = 1. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that '''k''' is a [[unit vector]].  Here ''M'' is the constant mass of the spinning object, ''Q'' is the constant charge of the spinning object, ''η'' is the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski tensor]], and ''a'' is a constant rotational parameter of the spinning object.  It is understood that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is directed along the positive z-axis.  The quantity ''r'' is not the radius, but rather is implicitly defined like this:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{x^2+y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the quantity ''r'' becomes the usual radius ''R''

:&lt;math&gt;r \to R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

when the rotational parameter ''a'' approaches zero.  In this form of solution, units are selected so that the speed of light is unity (''c'' = 1).  In order to provide a complete solution of the [[Einstein's field equation#Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell Equations]], the Kerr–Newman solution not only includes a formula for the metric tensor, but also a formula for the electromagnetic potential:&lt;ref name="Debney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burinskii, A.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCrtjHPcY3gC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=%22kerr-newman%22+and+%22potential%22+and+electromagnetic&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=27ReSdjSAqSsyASVxIz6Bg#PPA321,M1 “Kerr Geometry Beyond the Quantum Theory”] in ''Beyond the Quantum'', page 321 (Theo Nieuwenhuizen ed., World Scientific 2007). The formula for the vector potential of Burinskii differs from that of Debney et al. merely by a gradient which does not affect the fields.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} = \frac{Qr^3}{r^4 + a^2z^2}k_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

At large distances from the source (R &gt;&gt; a), these equations reduce to the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]] with:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} = \frac{Q}{R}k_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

In the Kerr–Schild form of the Kerr–Newman metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is everywhere equal to negative one, even near the source.&lt;ref name="Exact"&gt;Stephani, Hans et al.  ''Exact Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations'' (Cambridge University Press 2003). See [https://books.google.com/books?id=SiWXP8FjTFEC&amp;pg=PA485&amp;dq=%22Kerr-Schild%22+and+%22determinant+of+the+metric%22&amp;num=100 page 485] regarding determinant of metric tensor.

Setting &lt;math&gt;g_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; to 0 and solving for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; gives the inner and outer [[event horizon]], which is located at the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate

:&lt;math&gt;\dot r = \pm \frac{\sqrt{((r^2+a^2) \ E - a \ L_z \ q \ Q \ r)^2-\Delta \ (C+r^2)}}{\rho^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot \phi = \frac{E \ (a \ \sin^2 \theta \ (r^2+a^2)-a \ \sin^2 \theta \ \Delta)+L_z \ (\Delta-a^2 \ \sin^2 \theta)-q \ Q \ r \ a \ \sin^2 \theta}{\rho^2 \ \Delta \ \sin^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; for the total energy and &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt; for the axial angular momentum. &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Carter constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;C = p_{\theta}^{2} + \cos^{2}\theta \left( a^{2}(1 - E^{2}) + \frac{L_z^2}{ \sin^2\theta}\right) = a^2 \ (1-E^2) \ \sin^2 \delta + L_z^2 \ \tan^2 \delta = {\rm const.}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_{\theta} = \dot \theta \ \rho^2&lt;/math&gt; is the poloidial component of the testparticle's angular momentum, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; the orbital inclination angle.

:&lt;math&gt;L_z = \frac{v^{\phi} \ \bar R}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} = {\rm const.}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta \ \rho^2}{(1-v^2) \ \chi}} + \Omega \ L_z = {\rm const.}&lt;/math&gt;

are also conserved quantities. 

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{a \left(2 r-Q^2\right)}{\chi }&lt;/math&gt;

is the frame dragging induced angular velocity. The shorthand term &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \left(a ^2+r^2\right)^2-a ^2 \ \sin ^2 \theta  \ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;

The relation between the coordinate derivatives &lt;math&gt;\dot r, \ \dot \theta, \ \dot \phi&lt;/math&gt; and the local 3-velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;v^{r} = \dot r \ \sqrt{\frac{\rho^2 \ (1-v^2)}{\Delta}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the radial,

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\theta} = \dot \theta \ \sqrt{\rho^2 \ (1-v^2) }&lt;/math&gt;

for the poloidial, 

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\phi} = \frac{L_z \sqrt{1-v^2}}{\bar R}&lt;/math&gt;

for the axial and

:&lt;math&gt;v =  \frac{\sqrt{\dot t^2-\varsigma^2}}{\dot t} = \sqrt{\frac{\chi \ (E-L_z \ \Omega )^2 -\Delta \ \rho^2}{\chi \ (E-L_z \ \Omega )^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the total local velocity, where

:&lt;math&gt;\bar R = \sqrt{-g_{\phi \phi}} = \sqrt{\frac{\chi}{\rho^2}} \ \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

is the axial radius of gyration (local circumference divided by 2π), and

:&lt;math&gt;\varsigma = \sqrt{g^{t t}}  = \frac{\chi }{\Delta \ \rho^2}&lt;/math&gt;

the gravitational time dilation component. The local radial escape velocity for a neutral particle is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm esc}=\frac{\sqrt{\varsigma^2-1}}{\varsigma} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Special cases and generalizations ==
The Kerr–Newman metric is a generalization of other [[exact solutions in general relativity]]:

* [[Kerr metric]] if the charge ''Q'' is zero.
* [[Reissner–Nordström metric]] if the angular momentum ''J'' (or ''a'') is zero.
* [[Schwarzschild metric]] if the charge ''Q'' and the angular momentum ''J'' (or ''a'') are zero.
* [[Minkowski space]] if the mass ''M'', the charge ''Q'', and the rotation parameter ''a'' are all zero. Also, if gravity is intended to be removed, Minkowski space arises if the gravitational constant G is zero (with electric and magnetic fields more complicated than simply the [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic field produced by a magnetic moment|fields of a charged magnetic dipole]]).
The Kerr–Newman solution (with cosmological constant equal to zero) is also a special case of more general exact solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell Equations.&lt;ref name="Exact" /&gt;

==Some aspects of the solution==
Newman's result represents the simplest [[stationary spacetime|stationary]], [[axial symmetry|axisymmetric]], asymptotically flat solution of [[Einstein's equations]] in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]] in four dimensions. It is sometimes referred to as an "electrovacuum" solution of Einstein's equations.

Any Kerr–Newman source has its rotation axis aligned with its magnetic axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Punsly|first=Brian|title=High‐Energy Gamma‐Ray Emission from Galactic Kerr–Newman Black Holes. I. The Central Engine|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 May 1998|volume=498|issue=2|doi=10.1086/305561|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/498/2/640/|accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=646 |quote=All Kerr–Newman black holes have their rotation axis and magnetic axis aligned; they cannot pulse.|bibcode = 1998ApJ...498..640P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a Kerr–Newman source is different from commonly observed astronomical bodies, for which there is a substantial angle between the rotation axis and the [[magnetic moment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Kenneth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RdCUsMy3l7EC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22magnetic+dipole+moment%22+and+%22axis%22+and+%22the+sun%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=4DFdScHGIo6syATH6NmRAQ The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System]'', page 96 (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Kerr–Newman potential is considered as a model for a classical electron, it predicts an electron having not just a magnetic dipole moment, but also other multipole moments, such as an electric quadrupole moment.&lt;ref name="Kjell"&gt;Rosquist, Kjell. [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0412064v3 "Gravitationally Induced Electromagnetism at the Compton Scale,"] Arxiv.org (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  An electron quadrupole moment has not been detected empirically yet.&lt;ref name="Kjell" /&gt;

In the G=0 limit, the electromagnetic fields are those of a charged rotating disk inside a ring where the fields are infinite.  The total field energy for this disk is infinite, and so this G=0 limit does not solve the problem of infinite [[self-energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynden-Bell, D.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0410109v1 "Electromagnetic Magic: The Relativistically Rotating Disk,"] ''Physical Review D'', Volume 70, 105017 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Kerr metric]] for an uncharged rotating mass, the Kerr–Newman interior solution exists mathematically but is probably not representative of the actual metric of a physically realistic [[rotating black hole]] due to stability issues.  Although it represents a generalization of the Kerr metric, it is not considered as very important for astrophysical purposes since one does not expect that realistic [[black hole]]s have an important [[electric charge]].

The Kerr–Newman metric defines a black hole with an event horizon only when the following relation is satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;[[Reinhard Meinel]]. [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-20046-0_6  "A Physical Derivation of the Kerr–Newman Black Hole Solution"].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + Q^2 \leq M^2.&lt;/math&gt;

An electron's ''a'' and ''Q'' (suitably specified in [[geometrized units]]) both exceed its mass ''M'', in which case the metric has no event horizon and thus there can be no such thing as a [[black hole electron]] — only a [[naked singularity|naked]] spinning ring singularity.&lt;ref&gt;Burinskii, Alexander.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507109 "The Dirac-Kerr electron,"] Arxiv.org (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a metric has several seemingly unphysical properties, such as the ring's violation of the [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]], and also appearance of causality-violating [[closed timelike curve]]s in the immediate vicinity of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brandon Carter|Carter, Brandon]].  [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v174/i5/p1559_1 Global Structure of the Kerr Family of Gravitational Fields,] ''Physical Review'' 174, page 1559 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian theorist Alexander Burinskii wrote in 2007: "In this work we obtain an exact correspondence between the wave function of the Dirac equation and the spinor (twistorial) structure of the Kerr geometry. It allows us to assume that the Kerr–Newman geometry reflects the specific space-time structure of electron, and electron contains really the Kerr–Newman circular string of Compton size". The Burinskii paper describes an electron as a gravitationally confined ring singularity without an event horizon. It has some, but not all of the predicted properties of a black hole.&lt;ref&gt;Burinskii, Alexander. [https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0577 "Kerr Geometry as Space-Time Structure of the Dirac Electron,"] Arxiv.org (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The electromagnetic fields==
The electric and magnetic fields can be obtained in the usual way by differentiating the four-potential to obtain the [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field strength tensor]].  It will be convenient to switch over to three-dimensional vector notation.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} = \left(-\phi, A_x, A_y, A_z \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The static electric and magnetic fields are derived from the vector potential and the scalar potential like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = - \vec{\nabla} \phi \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A} \,&lt;/math&gt;
Using the Kerr–Newman formula for the four-potential in the Kerr–Schild form yields the following concise complex formula for the fields:&lt;ref&gt;Gair, Jonathan. [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jgair/research/kerrnewman.html "Boundstates in a Massless Kerr–Newman Potential"].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} + i\vec{B} = -\vec{\nabla}\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{(\vec{R}-i\vec{a})^2}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity omega (&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) in this last equation is similar to the [[Electric potential#Electric potential due to a point charge|Coulomb potential]], except that the radius vector is shifted by an imaginary amount.  This complex potential was discussed as early as the nineteenth century, by the French mathematician [[Paul Émile Appell]].&lt;ref&gt;Appell, Math. Ann. xxx (1887) pp. 155–156.  Discussed by Whittaker, Edmund and Watson, George.

'''Lea Lublin''' (born 1929, [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], Poland, died in 1999, [[Paris]], France&lt;ref name="Centre Pompidou"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personne: Lea Lublin|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAnXgG5/rGbggEp|website=Centre Pompidou|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Argentine-French performance artist. Her involvement with [[feminist movement]]s and themes included the [[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 2007.

==Early life ==
Lea Lublin [[History of the Jews in Argentina|emigrated]] with her family to Argentina in 1931 and grew up in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;Lea Lublin: Retrospective 2015, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; There she attended classes at the [[:es:Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón|Prilidiano Pueyrredón National School of Fine Arts]] from age 12 on and graduated in 1949.&lt;ref name="re-act feminism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-act feminism: Léa Lublin - Mon fils|url=http://www.reactfeminism.org/entry.php?l=lb&amp;id=219&amp;e=t|website=Re-act feminism|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lublin began her artist life as painter, but in mid-1960 after her move to Paris, she began her interest in exploration of new media and materials. This interest lead her to cooperation with [[Centro de Artes Visuales of the Institute Torquato di Tella]], an Argentinean center for experimental and avant-garde art.

== Career ==
Lublin's work investigates imagery, often searching for what may not have yet been seen within imagery that is otherwise familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/contemporary-women-artists/oclc/40869639&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Contemporary women artists|last=Hillstrom|first=Laurie Collier|last2=Hillstrom|first2=Kevin|date=1999-01-01|publisher=St. James Press|isbn=1558623728|location=Detroit|page=407-409|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been influenced by psychoanalysis and feminist thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"LUBLIN, Lea." ''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''. ''Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lublin activated her works, often encouraging the viewer to interact with the work. For example, she mounted glass over painted reproductions of famous, iconographic paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and installed windshield wipers onto the glass. The audience was invited to squirt water on the painting, which would be cleared again by the wipers.&lt;ref&gt;Lea Lublin: Retrospective 2015, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Large-scale [[Installation art]] works followed. Lublin immersed viewers into the work, using made-to-specs inflatable tubes and objects, as well as black light and dark rooms or heaps of tiny plastic balls in which audience members could sit and cover themselves.

Lublin also created [[performance art]] sometimes called "exhibition-performances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In "Mon fils" (1968), she participated in the respectable May Exhibition in Paris by taking her baby son to the museums during the regular exhibition hours and exhibiting him and herself by doing the normal care of changing diapers, breast feeding and putting her son to sleep in his bed that she had brought with them.&lt;ref name="Lenbachhaus" /&gt; This brought public attention to social and gender roles in her work. She continued performances of this kind in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] until the end of the 1960s. Her next work the "Terranauts" (1969) was deeply influenced by French feminism. Lublin eventually moved permanently to Paris, where she worked and lived until her death in 1999.

In her work, Lublin left behind the flat canvas that she had used as painter and became part of the movement of the 1960s that used art as a means for involved active social dialogue. Lublin supported the division on art and the life, building on [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]]' belief that art is a form of breathing. And her stand in it was feminist, involving the audience, critical but open for different receiver's groups.

Starting in the 1970s, Lublin tended to present her work in public rather than inside museums. She asked questions to passers by originally regarding art and later about the role of the women. Lublin also put provocative questions on large cloths, hoisted like flags to attract attention. By setting up closed circuit TV cameras nearby, she gave contributors the air of speaking as pundits on TV, breaking with role expectations and their own personal experience.

Beginning in the 1980s and until her last works in the mid 1990s, Lublin returned to interacting with iconographic works, particularly [[Renaissance]] paintings. She deconstructed the imagery of these paintings by, for example, removing the child from different paintings of Madonna with the child. This work explored the role of the baby and his mother in paintings created by male painters. Following [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] patterns, she identified the painter with the child looking for an eroticized image of the mother in the works or otherwise revealing sexual undertones in Christian imagery.&lt;ref name="Lenbachhaus" /&gt;

When Lublin briefly returned to her former home [[Buenos Aires]] in 1989, she investigated [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] stay in the city from 1918 to 1919. Lublin got access to Duchamp's former apartment and noticed that both the old windows and the still mostly original colors of some walls matched those of Duchamp's iconic 1920 work ''Fresh Widow'' which he made after returning to Paris. Lublin also discovered that the female alter ego Duchamp used after 1920, Rose Sélavy, matched advertising in a Buenos Aires newspaper that he was known to have read. When she left, she stole the dilapidated letter box from Duchamp's former apartment and exhibited it later, recalling his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymade]] works.&lt;ref name="Lenbachhaus" /&gt; Lublin's interactions with Duchamp continued when she deconstructed the Rose advertising as well as his famous pissoirs in several of her own works, shifting them into a dispute with feminist statements. One of these was titled ''Le corps amer (à mère), l'objet perdu de M.D.'', shown at ''Femininmasculin'' at [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Beauborg]] in Paris. This piece consisted of a large, transparent skirt, stomach, and breasts with a urinal inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/re-enchantment/oclc/212627287&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Re-enchantment|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415960519|editor-last=Elkins|editor-first=James|location=New York|language=English|editor-last2=Morgan|editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lublin is considered to be part of the same generation as artists [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Allan Kaprow]].

==Works in collections==
Her works are in the collections of [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Centre national des arts plastiques]], the [[Fonds régional d’art contemporain Alsace]], and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref name=Lenbachhaus&gt;{{cite web|title=Lea Lublin - Retrospective|url=http://www.lenbachhaus.de/exhibitions/lea-lublin/?L=1|website=Lenbachhaus - Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau München|publisher=Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau München|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the existing works are in her estate, administrated by Nicolas Lublin in Paris. In 2015 the [[Lenbachhaus]], in [[Munich]], Germany hosts the first ever retrospective, drawing heavily on the estate and works from several museum collections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5606">{{short description|Legal status wherein an individual or entity can not be held liable for a violation of the law}}
'''Legal immunity''', or '''immunity from prosecution''', is a [[legal status]] wherein an individual or entity cannot be held liable for a violation of the law, in order to facilitate societal aims that outweigh the value of imposing liability in such cases. Such legal immunity may be from [[criminal prosecution]], or from [[civil liability]] (being subject of [[lawsuit]]), or both. The most notable forms of legal immunity are [[diplomatic immunity]], [[judicial immunity]], and [[witness immunity]]. One author has described legal immunity as "the obverse of a legal power:"&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;Dudley Knowles, ''Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction'' (2009), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A party has an immunity with respect to some action, object or status, if some other relevant party – in this context, another state or international agency, or citizen or group of citizens – has no (power) right to alter the party's legal standing in point of rights or duties in the specified respect. There is a wide range of legal immunities that may be invoked in the name of the right to rule. In international law, immunities may be created when states assert powers of derogation, as is permitted, for example, from the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] 'in times of war or other public emergency'. Equally familiar examples include the immunities against prosecution granted to representatives (MPs or councillors) and government officials in pursuit of their duties. Such legal immunities may be suspect as potential violations of the rule of law, or regarded as quite proper, as necessary protections for the officers of the state in the rightful pursuit of their duties.}}

==Criticism==
Legal immunities may be subject to criticism because they institute a separate standard of conduct for those who receive them. For example, as one author notes:

{{quote|In the United Kingdom, some exercises of the royal prerogative, which seems to give the government of the day opportunities for massive and unaccountable discretion, rightly come under suspicion, whereas the immunity from libel proceedings of Members of Parliament speaking in the House, or of persons giving evidence in a court of law, is generally regarded as an acceptable protection against powerful (and wealthy) interests who would otherwise constrain public debate or the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt;}}

==Types==
===Immunity of government officials===
Many forms of immunity are granted to government officials to enable them to carry out their functions without fear of being sued or charged with a crime for so doing: 
*[[Absolute immunity]], a type of immunity for government officials that confers total immunity when acting in the course of their duties
*[[Qualified immunity]], in the United States, immunity of individuals performing tasks as part of the government's actions
*[[Judicial immunity]], immunity of a judge or magistrate in the course of their official duties
*[[Parliamentary immunity]], immunity granted to elected officials during their tenure and in the course of their duties
*[[Speech and Debate Clause]], a provision in the [[United States Constitution]] that provides immunity to members of Congress for statements made in either house
*[[Sovereign immunity]], the prevention of lawsuits or prosecution against rulers or governments without their given consent
**[[Sovereign immunity in the United States]] bars suit against federal, state, and tribal governments, which cannot be sued without their consent.  Governmental consent to be sued is expressed through legislation as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity  

Grants of immunity are particularly important in intergovernmental relations, where traditions have arisen to prevent the diplomatic representatives of a country from being harassed by their host countries.
*[[Diplomatic immunity]], agreement between sovereign governments to exclude diplomats from local laws
*[[Immunity from prosecution (international law)]], exclusion of governments or their officials from prosecution under international law
*[[State immunity]], principle of international law that the government of a state is not amenable before the courts of another state

Such immunities may be granted by law (statutory or constitutional) or by [[treaty]].

===Immunity of citizens participating in the legal process===
*[[Amnesty law]], a law that provides immunity for past crimes
*[[Spousal privilege]], also called spousal immunity, protects a spouse from testifying against the defendant
*[[Witness immunity]], immunity granted to a [[witness]] in exchange for [[testimony]]
*[[Reporter's privilege]], a limited [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right many jurisdictions by statutory law or judicial decision have by which journalists may not be prosecuted for protecting their confidential sources from [[discovery (law)|discovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexmedia.com.au/2010/10/journalist-shield-laws.html|title=LexMedia|work=lexmedia.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Charitable immunity]], immunity from liability granted to charities in many countries from the 19th century to the mid-20th century

Such immunities may be granted by law or, for witness immunity, by [[prosecutor]]s or other authorities on a case by case basis, commonly as an agreement with the witnesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6700">'''Levinthal's paradox''' is a [[thought experiment]], also constituting a [[self-reference]] in the theory of [[protein folding]]. In 1969, [[Cyrus Levinthal]] noted that, because of the very large number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in an unfolded [[Peptide|polypeptide chain]], the molecule has an astronomical number of possible conformations. An estimate of 3&lt;sup&gt;300&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt; was made in one of his papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Levinthal|first=Cyrus|year=1969|title=How to Fold Graciously|

|last=Levinthal|first=Cyrus|year=1968|title=Are there pathways for protein folding?|journal=Journal de Chimie Physique et de Physico-Chimie Biologique|volume=65|pages=44–45|url=http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/courses/biochem704/Reading/Levinthal1968.pdf|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090902211239/http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/courses/biochem704/Reading/Levinthal1968.pdf|archivedate = 2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, a polypeptide of 100 [[Amino acid|residues]] will have 99 [[peptide bond]]s, and therefore 198 different [[Dihedral angle#Dihedral angles of biological molecules|phi and psi]] bond angles. If each of these bond angles can be in one of three stable conformations, the protein may misfold into a maximum of 3&lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt; different conformations (including any possible folding redundancy). Therefore, if a protein were to attain its correctly folded configuration by sequentially sampling all the possible conformations, it would require a time longer than the age of the universe to arrive at its correct native conformation. This is true even if conformations are sampled at rapid ([[nanosecond]] or [[picosecond]]) rates. The "paradox" is that most small proteins fold spontaneously on a millisecond or even microsecond time scale. The solution to this paradox has been established by computational approaches to [[protein structure prediction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zwanzig R, Szabo A, Bagchi B |title=Levinthal's paradox |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |date=1992-01-01 |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=20–22 |pmc=48166 |pmid=1729690 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinthal himself was aware that [[Anfinsen's dogma|proteins fold spontaneously]] and on short timescales. He suggested that the paradox can be resolved if "protein folding is sped up and guided by the rapid formation of local interactions which then determine the further folding of the peptide; this suggests local amino acid sequences which form stable interactions and serve as [[nucleation]] points in the folding process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rooman, Marianne Rooman |author2=Yves Dehouck |author3=Jean Marc Kwasigroch |author4=Christophe Biot |author5=Dimitri Gilis |year=2002 |title=What is paradoxical about Levinthal Paradox? |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=327–329 |url=http://www.jbsdonline.com/full_text_PDFs/Sdc6igJmaYp-~Warqqdd82uzSIT.pdf |pmid=12437370 |doi=10.1080/07391102.2002.10506850 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the protein folding [[Reaction intermediate|intermediates]] and the partially folded [[transition state]]s were experimentally detected, which explains the fast [[protein folding]]. This is also described as protein folding directed within [[Folding funnel|funnel-like energy landscapes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dill K |author2=H.S. Chan |year=1997| title= From Levinthal to pathways to funnels|journal=Nat. Struct.

Levinthal also suggested that the native structure might have a higher energy, if the lowest energy was not kinetically accessible. An analogy is a rock tumbling down a hillside that lodges in a gully rather than reaching the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Hunter, Philip |year=2006| title= Into the fold| journal= EMBO Rep. |volume=7|issue=3| pages=249–252 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400655 | pmid=16607393| pmc= 1456894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suggested explanations==
* According to [[Edward Trifonov]] and Igor Berezovsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Berezovsky|first1 = Igor N.|last2 = Trifonov|first2 = Edward N.|title = Loop fold structure of proteins: Resolution of Levinthal's paradox|journal = Journal of Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics|year = 2002|volume = 20|pages = 5–6|issn = 0739-1102|url = http://paradox.harvard.edu/~igor/PUBL_BER/PUB22.pdf|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/07391102.2002.10506817|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050212130449/http://paradox.harvard.edu/~igor/PUBL_BER/PUB22.pdf|archivedate = 2005-02-12|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the proteins fold by subunits (modules) of the size of 25-30 amino acids.

'''Marta Minujín''' (born 1943) is an Argentine [[conceptual art|conceptual]] and [[performance art]]ist.

==Life and work==
[[File:Marta Minujín signature.png|thumb|right|200px|Signature.]]

Marta Minujín was born in the [[San Telmo]] neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]]. She met a young economist, Juan Carlos Gómez Sabaini, and married him in secret in 1959; the couple had two children. As a student in the [[National University Art Institute]], she first exhibited her work in a 1959 show at the Teatro Agón. A scholarship from the [[w:es:Fondo nacional de las Artes|National Arts Foundation]] allowed her to travel to [[Paris]] as one of the young Argentine artists featured in ''[[Pablo Curatella Manes]] and Thirty Argentines of the New Generation'', a 1960 exhibit organized by the prominent sculptor and [[Paris Biennale]] judge.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/06/conexiones/t-1008529.htm ''Clarín'': 'Superé todos mis problemas, como Maradona' (7/6/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her time in Paris inspired her to create "livable sculptures," notably ''La Destrucción'', in which she assembled mattresses along the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|Impasse Roussin]], only to invite other avant-garde artists in her entourage, including [[Christo]] and Paul-Armand Gette, to destroy the display. This 1963 creation would be the first of her "[[Happening]]s"{{spaced ndash}}events as works of arts in themselves; among her hosts during her stay was Finance Minister [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (later President of [[France]]).&lt;ref name=pagina12&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-639-2003-05-25.html ''Página/12'': Pop-ular (5/25/2003) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned a National Award in 1964 at Buenos Aires' [[Torcuato di Tella Institute]], where she prepared two happenings: ''Eróticos en technicolor'' and the interactive ''Revuélquese y viva'' (''Roll Around in Bed and Live''). Her ''Cabalgata'' (''Cavalcade'') aired on [[Canal 7 Argentina|Public Television]] that year, and involved horses with paint buckets tied to their tails. These displays took her to nearby [[Montevideo]], where she organized ''Sucesos'' (''Events'') at the [[Uruguay]]an capital's [[Estadio Luis Tróccoli|Tróccoli Stadium]] with 500 chickens, artists of contrasting physical shape, motorcycles, and other elements.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

She joined Rubén Santantonín at the di Tella Institute in 1965 to create ''La Menesunda'' (''Mayhem''), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by [[neon]] lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with [[black light]]ing, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of [[pop art]] in Minujín's "mayhem."&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

These works earned her a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1966, by which she relocated to [[New York City]]. The ''[[coup d'état]]'' by General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] in June of that year made her fellowship all the more fortuitous, as the new regime would frequently censor and ban irreverent displays such as hers. Minujín delved into [[psychedelic art]] in New York, of which among her best-known creations was that of the "Minuphone," where patrons could enter a telephone booth, dial a number, and be surprised by colors projecting from the glass panels, sounds, and seeing themselves on a television screen in the floor.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899583,00.html ''Time'' (July 7, 1967). Sculpture: The Number is 581-4570, but Don't Call It]&lt;/ref&gt; The Minuphone was designed and constructed, in collaboration with her, by engineer Per Biorn, who was employed at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and the work was shown at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York City.&lt;ref&gt; Biorn Biography [http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=581]&lt;/ref&gt; She was on hand in 1971 for the Buenos Aires premiere of ''Operación Perfume'', and in New York, befriended fellow conceptual artist [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

She returned to Argentina in 1976, and afterwards created a series of reproductions of [[classical Greek sculpture]]s in [[plaster of paris]], as well as miniatures of the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires Obelisk]] carved out of [[panettone]], of the [[Venus de Milo]] carved from cheese, and of [[Tango (music)|Tango]] vocalist [[Carlos Gardel]] for a 1981 display in [[Medellín]]. The latter, a [[sheet metal]] creation, was stuffed with cotton and lit, creating a metaphor for the legendary crooner's untimely 1935 death in a Medellín plane crash.&lt;ref name=pagina12/&gt; She was awarded the first of a series of [[Konex Award]]s, the highest in the Argentine cultural realm, in 1982.&lt;ref name=konex&gt;[http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/premios/curriculum.asp?id=741 Fundación Konex: Marta Minujín {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Argentine general election, 1983|return of democracy in 1983]], following seven years of a generally failed dictatorship, prompted Minujín to create a monument to a glaring, inanimate victim of the regime: [[freedom of expression]]. Assembling 30,000 [[censorship|banned books]] (including works as diverse as those by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz]], and [[Darcy Ribeiro]], as well as satires such as ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'', reference volumes such as ''[[Enciclopedia Salvat]]'', and even children's texts, notably ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]), she designed the "Parthenon of Books," and following President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s December 10 inaugural, had it mounted on a boulevard median along the [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. Dismantled after three weeks, its mass of newly unbanned titles was distributed to the public below.&lt;ref name=pagina12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=986759 ''La Nación'': Política y concepto {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A conversation with Warhol in New York regarding the [[Latin American debt crisis]] inspired one of her most publicized "happenings:" ''The Debt''. Purchasing a shipment of [[maize]], Minujín dramatized the Argentine cost of servicing the foreign debt with a 1985 photo series in which she symbolically handed the maize to Warhol "in payment" for the debt; she never again saw Warhol, who died in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/imprimir/diario/suplementos/radar/9-2323-2005-06-20.html ''Página/12'': Andy y yo (6/19/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Minujín has continued to display her art pieces and happenings in the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Fine Arts Museum]], the [[ArteBA]] contemporary art festival Buenos Aires, the [[Barbican Center]], and a vast number of other international galleries and art shows, while continuing to satirize [[consumer culture]] (particularly relating to women).&lt;ref name=konex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/16929/arteba/ ArteBA {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; She is well known for her belief that ''"everything is art."'' &lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

The '''Master Hilarion''', is considered a female saint within the [["I_AM"_Activity|I AM movement]] and is one of the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]" and in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] is one of the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]). Creator of the Orion's 144,000 Council 5th Dimension Merkhaba yellow infusion ascension Kundalini ((astral projection, soul travel)) Eckankar Master she is considered to be the Chohan (Lord) of the Fifth Ray (see [[Seven Rays]]).&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 Theosophical Publishing House. Master Hilarion outlined on pages 238-239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

==Incarnations==
{{Theosophy}}
The Master Hilarion is believed to have been incarnated as the [[Paul Roman Catholic ((Divine Female)) Apostle| Apostle Paul ((Roman Catholic Divine Female)) of Tarsus]] and the Neo-Platonic philosopher [[Iamblichus]]. Some have believed that she was the Christian saint Hilarion.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - "Hilarion - Master of the Fifth Ray" pages 169 - 210&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible, since although the years Iamblichus, also known as Iamblichus Chalcidensis, (c. 245 - c. 325) was embodied overlap the lifetime of St. Hilarion (291 - 371), various traditions such as Hindu and Tibetan Buddhism hold that it is possible for the spiritually advanced to have more than one incarnation happening at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume VII. New York: Robert Appleton Company. 1910&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=August 2017}}

In October 1884 Helena Blavatsky made reference to Hilarion (using the spelling: "Hillarion"):
:"''...an "Eastern adept, who has since gone for his final initiation," who had passed, en route from Egypt to Thibet, through Bombay and visited us in his physical body. Why should this "Adept" be the Mahatma in question? Are there then no other Adepts than Mahatma Koot Hoomi? Every Theosophist at headquarters knows that I meant a Greek gentleman, whom I have known since 1860''."

On 20 February 1881  [[Kuthumi]], in one of his letters to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], referred to him as

:"''one of ours having passed through Bombay on his way from Cyprus to Tibet''".

His travel to his "final initiation" is referred to in an entry in [[Henry Olcott]]'s diary, dated 19 February 1881, written in Bombay:

:"Hillarion is here en route for Tibet and has been looking over, in, and through the situation. Finds B– something morally awful. Views on India, Bombay, the TS in Bombay, Ceylon (––), England and Europe, Christianity and other subjects highly interesting." (''Letters from the Masters of Wisdom'', 2nd Series, page 93) &lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;Sisson, Marina Cesar. ''Helena Blavatsky and the Enigma of John King'' Originally published as ''Informativo HPB'', n° 3, 4 and 5 English translation available at [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/sisson1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in the spiritual hierarchy==

Theosophist [[C.W. Leadbeater]] wrote that the Master Hilarion's primary influence is upon the scientists of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House--Page 238&lt;/ref&gt;   

In the teachings of [[Alice A. Bailey]], the fifth ray of the seven rays, called by Alice A. Bailey the ''orange ray'', which she is said to oversee, is called the ray of ''concrete science''.&lt;ref name="fire1237"&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the Ascended Master Teachings, as ''Hierarch of the Brotherhood of Truth'' in the etheric plane over Crete, Hilarion is said to assist the scientists and spiritual leaders of the world with the ''flame of truth'' and channels the spiritual energy of what is called in the Ascended Master Teachings the ''green ray'' or ''emerald ray'', the 5th of the Seven Rays.&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}  It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that before the Master Hilarion took over the chohanship of the Fifth Ray, [[Lord Ling]] fulfilled that function.&lt;ref name="Prophet Pages 190-193"&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 190-193 Master Lord Ling&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}

==Skeptical view==

[[K. Paul Johnson]] speculates that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors.  Johnson asserts that the "Master Hilarion" was actually Ooton Liato, a stage magician from Cyprus whom she met in New York City in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/johnson1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''meta-rights''' are the [[entitlement]]s of individuals to their [[rights]], including the possibility to [[waive]], transfer or sell their rights. When we talk of the rights of individuals, we do not always distinguish between rights which can be waived or sold and rights which are non-negotiable. Yet that distinction and often the distinction is made implicitly. When we say a person has a right to her house, we usually mean that she also has the meta right to sell the right. On the other hand, when we say a person has the right to his body parts, we usually assume this comes without the accompanying meta right to sell these rights. Economic efficiency usually comes with having rights which come together with the meta right to sell the right. It is arguable that we should be much more explicit about when rights come together with meta rights and when without, and the moral basis that accompany these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaushik Basu |title=The right to give up rights |journal=Economica |volume=51 |year=1984|doi=10.2307/2554226 |jstor=2554226 |pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/basic-rights-and-meta-rights#axzz2SSpJJAeL&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mind map''' is a  [[diagram]] used to visually organize information. A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn H. Hopper, Practicing College Learning Strategies, 7th Edition, {{ISBN|9781305109599}}, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. Mind maps are considered to be a type of [[spider diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mind-map?q=mind+map |title=Mind Map noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept in the 1970s was "idea [[sunburst chart|sun bursting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/mindmapping-learning-study-memory/who-invented-mind-mapping.html |title=Who invented mind mapping |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Although the term "mind map" was first popularized by British [[popular psychology]] author and television personality [[Tony Buzan]], the use of diagrams that visually "map" information using branching and [[Radial tree|radial maps]] traces back centuries. These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, [[brainstorming]], [[memory]], [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s. Mind maps are similar in radial structure to [[concept map]]s, developed by learning experts in the 1970s, but differ in that the former are simplified by focusing around a single central key concept.

== Popularisation of the term "mind map" ==

Buzan's specific approach, and the introduction of the term "mind map", arose during a 1974 [[BBC]] TV series he hosted, called ''Use Your Head''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/blog/mapping-history/roots-of-visual-mapping/ |title=Roots of visual mapping - The mind-mapping.org Blog |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buzan|first=Tony |date=1974 |title=Use Your Head |location=London|publisher=BBC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, and companion book series, Buzan promoted his conception of radial tree, diagramming key words in a colorful, radiant, tree-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |title=Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview |website=KnowledgeBoard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000356/http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |archive-date=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzan says the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]. He argues that while "traditional" outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular assumptions about the functions of [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

==Mind map guidelines==
Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:

# Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
# Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
# Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
# Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
# The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
# Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
# Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
# Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
# Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
# Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.

== Uses ==

[[File:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
As with other diagramming tools, mind maps can be used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]]&lt;ref&gt;'Mind maps as active learning tools', by Willis, CL. Journal of computing sciences in colleges. {{ISSN|1937-4771}}. 2006. Volume:
21 Issue: 4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organization|organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, as a [[mnemonic technique]], or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

In addition to these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications; for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine]]s and search and tag query recommender.&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | chapter=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map.&lt;ref name=Beel2009 /&gt;

==Differences from other visualizations==

* ''Concept maps'': Mind maps differ from [[concept maps]] in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas. Also, concept maps typically have text labels on their connecting lines/arms. Mind maps are based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.  However, either can be part of a larger [[personal knowledge base]] system.
* ''Modelling graphs'': There is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML diagram]] or a [[semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps serve a different purpose: they help with memory and organization. Mind maps are collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics, and, through the use of colour, icons and visual links, are informal and necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
Cunningham (2005) conducted a user study in which 80% of the students thought "mindmapping helped them understand concepts and ideas in science".&lt;ref name="Cunningham05"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Glennis Edge Cunningham| title=Mindmapping: Its Effects on Student Achievement in High School Biology| year=2005| publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also report some subjective positive effects on the use of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Holland2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Holland, Lynda Holland, Jenny Davies| title=An investigation into the concept of mind mapping and the use of mind mapping software to support and improve student academic performance| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antoni2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author=D'Antoni, A.V., Zipp, G.P.| title=Applications of the Mind Map Learning Technique in Chiropractic Education: A Pilot Study and Literature| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive opinions on their effectiveness, however, were much more prominent among students of art and design than in students of computer and information technology, with 62.5% vs 34% (respectively) agreeing that they were able to understand concepts better with mind mapping software&lt;ref name="Holland2004" /&gt;. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline).&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |author2=Hussain, F. |author3=Hennessy, E.  |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions".&lt;ref name="Nesbit06"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nesbit, J.C., Adesope, O.O.| title=Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis| journal=Review of Educational Research| year=2006| volume=76| number=3| pages=413| publisher=Sage Publications| doi=10.3102/00346543076003413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". However, results were inconsistent, with the authors noting "significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.

===Features of mind maps===
Joeran Beel and Stefan Langer conducted a comprehensive analysis of the content of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Beel2011d"&gt;{{cite book| author=Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer| chapter=An Exploratory Analysis of Mind Maps| title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'11)| year=2011| publisher=ACM| url=http://docear.org/papers/An%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Mind%20Maps%20--%20preprint.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analysed 19,379 mind maps from 11,179 users of the mind mapping applications SciPlore MindMapping (now Docear) and [[MindMeister]]. Results include that average users create only a few mind maps (mean=2.7), average mind maps are rather small (31 nodes) with each node containing about three words (median). However, there were exceptions. One user created more than 200 mind maps, the largest mind map consisted of more than 50,000 nodes and the largest node contained ~7,500 words. The study also showed that between different mind mapping applications (Docear vs MindMeister) significant differences exist related to how users create mind maps.

===Automatic creation of mind maps===
There have been some attempts to create mind maps automatically. Brucks &amp; Schommer created mind maps automatically from full-text streams.&lt;ref name="Brucks2008"&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer| title=Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream| year=2008| arxiv=0810.4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberger et al. extracted the main story of a text and presented it as mind map.&lt;ref name="Rothenberger2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rothenberger, T, Oez, S, Tahirovic, E, Schommer, Christoph| title=Figuring out Actors in Text Streams: Using Collocations to establish Incremental Mind-maps| journal= | arxiv=0803.2856| year=2008| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.2856R}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a patent about automatically creating sub-topics in mind maps.&lt;ref name="Plotkin09"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Software tool for creating outlines and mind maps that generates subtopics automatically|journal=USPTO Application: 20090119584|volume=|author=Robert Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[List of concept- and mind-mapping software|Mind-mapping software]] can be used to organize large amounts of information, combining spatial organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind-mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the Internet, like spreadsheets, documents, Internet sites and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdevin.com/top-10-totally-free-mind-mapping-software-tools/|title=Top 10 Totally Free Mind Mapping Software Tools|last=Santos|first=Devin|date=15 February 2013|publisher=IMDevin|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that mind-mapping can improve learning/study efficiency up to 15% over conventional [[note-taking]].&lt;ref name="Farrand2002" /&gt;

'''Minority''' ({{lang-fr|minorité}}) is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their books ''Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature'' (1975), ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), and elsewhere. In these texts, they criticize the concept of "[[majority]]".  For Deleuze and Guattari, "[[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]-minor(itarian)" is primarily an [[ethic]]al action, one of the becomings one is [[affect (philosophy)|affected]] by when avoiding "becoming-fascist". They argued further that the concept of a "[[people]]", when invoked by subordinate groups or those aligned with them, always refers to a minority, whatever its numerical power might be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Rimi | last2= Khan | journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies  | volume= 31 | issue= 1 | pages= 3–4 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Deleuze and Guattari the "minor" and "becoming-minority" does not refer to minority groups as described in ordinary language.  Minority groups are defined by identities and are thus '''molar configurations'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; belonging to the majoritarian State machine. (Molar configurations are composed of infinite lines of particles, i.e. lines of becoming.)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Stivale, ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'' (Routledge, 2014), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deleuze and Guattari's central example here is [[Franz Kafka]]. Kafka finds himself at home among neither the [[Prague]] Jews nor the dominant German and Austria-Hungarian power structure.  For him a "people is missing" and his literature sets out to summon that people.  Nonetheless, there is a connection between what are ordinarily referred to as "minorities" and Deleuze and Guattari's conception of the minor and becoming-minor.  If becoming-minor often occurs in the context of what are ordinarily called [[minority group]]s, then this is because, Deleuze and Guattari argue, becoming-minor is catalyzed by existence in cramped social spaces.  The key point not to be missed is that becoming-minor is not related to molar identities, nor is it a politics that seeks representation or recognition of such identities (though Deleuze and Guattari stress that these are worthwhile political ambitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Rimi | last2= Khan | journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies  | volume= 31 | issue= 1 | pages= 1–12 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of [[patriarchy]] provides an illustration of how the concept of "minority" is used: while there may be more women than men numerically, in Deleuze and Guattari's terms, which are sensitive to relations of power, men still constitute the majority whereas women form a minority. Thus the concept of "becoming-minor" converges with that of "becoming-woman" (as they say, "everyone has to 'become-woman', even women..."), "becoming-animal", "becoming-molecular", "becoming-imperceptible" and ultimately, "becoming-revolutionary". Each type of affective becoming marks a new phase of a larger process that Deleuze and Guattari call [[deterritorialization]].

'''Motivation''' is the reason for people's [[Action_(philosophy)|actions]], willingness and goals. Motivation is derived from the word ''motive'' which is defined as a need that requires satisfaction. These [[Need|needs]] could also be wants or desires that are acquired through influence of culture, society, lifestyle, etc. or generally innate. Motivation is one's direction to [[behavior]], or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior, a set of force that acts behind the motives. An individual's motivation may be inspired by others or events (extrinsic motivation)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; or it may come from within the individual (intrinsic motivation)&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000" /&gt;. Motivation has been considered as one of the most important reasons that inspires a person to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|last2=Zafarghandi|first2=Amir Mahda Vi|last3=Tous|first3=Maryam Danaye|date=2013-01-01|title=Motivation, Integrativeness, Organizational Influence, Anxiety, and English Achievement|journal=Glottotheory|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1524/glot.2013.0012|issn=2196-6907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastering motivation to allow sustained and deliberate practice is central to high levels of achievement e.g. in the worlds of elite sport, medicine or music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ericsson |first=Karl Anders|title=Peak: Secrets from the new science of expertise|isbn=9781531864880|oclc=961226136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
{{Main article|Motivational salience}}
Motivation as a desire to perform an action is usually defined as having two parts, directional such as directed towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative one, as well as the activated "seeking phase" and consummatory "liking phase". This type of motivation has [[neurobiological]] roots in the [[basal ganglia]], and mesolimbic, [[dopaminergic pathways]]. Activated "seeking" behavior, such as locomotor activity, is influenced by dopaminergic drugs, and [[microdialysis]] experiments reveal that [[dopamine]] is released during the anticipation of a [[reward system |reward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(96)80077-8  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222809901|title=Neurobehavioural mechanisms of reward and motivation|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=228–236|year=1996|last1=Robbins|first1=Trevor W.|last2=Everitt|first2=Barry J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "wanting behavior" associated with a rewarding stimulus can be increased by microinjections of [[dopamine]] and dopaminergic drugs in the [[Nucleus accumbens |dorsorostral nucleus accumbens]] and [[Ventral pallidum |posterior ventral palladum]].  [[Opioid]] injections in this area produce pleasure, however outside of these [[hedonic hotspots]] they create an increased desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berridge |first1=Kent C |last2=Kringelbach |first2=Morten L |title=Neuroscience of affect: brain mechanisms of pleasure and displeasure |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=294–303 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2013.01.017 |pmid=23375169 |pmc=3644539 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, depletion or inhibition of dopamine in neurons of the nucleus accumbens decreases appetitive but not consummatory behavior. Dopamine is further implicated in motivation as administration of amphetamine increased the break point in a progressive ratio self-reinforcement schedule.  That is, subjects were willing to go to greater lengths (e.g. press a lever more times) to obtain a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salamone |first1=John D. |last2=Correa |first2=Mercè |title= The mysterious motivational functions of mesolimbic dopamine|journal=Neuron |date=8 November 2012 |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=470–485 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.021 |issn=0896-6273 |pmid=23141060 |pmc=4450094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation can be conceived of as a cycle in which thoughts influence behaviors, drive performance affects thoughts, and the cycle begins again. Each stage of the cycle is composed of many dimensions including attitudes, beliefs, intentions, effort, and withdrawal which can all affect the motivation that an individual experiences. Most psychological theories hold that motivation exists purely within the individual, but [[Cultural-historical psychology|socio-cultural theories]] express motivation as an outcome of participation in actions and activities within the [[cultural]] context of social groups.&lt;ref name="Rueda and Moll 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rueda|first1=Richard|last2=Moll|first2=Luis C.|editor1-last=O'Neill, Jr.|editor1-first=Harold F.|editor2-last=Drillings|editor2-first=Michael|title=Motivation: Theory and Research|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|isbn=978-0-8058-1286-2|chapter=Chapter 7: A Sociocultural Perspective on Motivation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural theories===
The natural system assumes that people have higher order needs, which contrasts with the rational theory that suggests people dislike work and only respond to rewards and punishment.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"&gt;Dobbin, Frank. “From Incentives to Teamwork: Rational and Natural Management Systems.” Lecture. Harvard University. Cambridge, Massachusetts. 1 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Douglas McGregor|McGregor's]] [[Theory X and Theory Y#Theory Y|Theory Y]], human behavior is based on satisfying a hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, social, ego, and [[self-fulfillment]].&lt;ref name="McGregor"&gt;McGregor, D., 1960. The Human Side of Enterprise, New York, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiological needs are the lowest and most important level. These fundamental requirements include food, rest, shelter, and exercise. After physiological needs are satisfied, employees can focus on safety needs, which include “protection against danger, threat, deprivation.”&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt; However, if management makes arbitrary or biased employment decisions, then an employee's safety needs are unfulfilled.

The next set of needs is social, which refers to the desire for acceptance, affiliation, reciprocal friendships and love. As such, the natural system of management assumes that close-knit work teams are productive. Accordingly, if an employee's social needs are unmet, then he will act disobediently.&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt;

There are two types of egoistic needs, the second-highest order of needs. The first type refers to one's self-esteem, which encompasses self-confidence, independence, achievement, competence, and knowledge. The second type of needs deals with reputation, status, recognition, and respect from colleagues.&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt; Egoistic needs are much more difficult to satisfy.

The highest order of needs is for self-fulfillment, including recognition of one's full potential, areas for self-improvement, and the opportunity for creativity. This differs from the rational system, which assumes that people prefer routine and security to creativity.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"/&gt; Unlike the rational management system, which assumes that humans don’t care about these higher order needs, the natural system is based on these needs as a means for motivation.

====Self-management through teamwork====
To successfully manage and motivate employees, the natural system posits that being part of a group is necessary.&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;Elton Mayo, 1984 [1949]. “Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.” Pp. 279-292 in Organization Theory: Selected Readings. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of structural changes in social order, the workplace is more fluid and adaptive according to [[Elton Mayo|Mayo]]. As a result, individual employees have lost their sense of stability and security, which can be provided by a membership in a group. However, if teams continuously change within jobs, then employees feel anxious, empty, and irrational and become harder to work with.&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; The innate desire for lasting human association and management “is not related to single workers, but always to working groups.”&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; In groups, employees will self-manage and form relevant customs, duties, and traditions.

====Wage incentives====
Humans are motivated by additional factors besides wage incentives.&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"&gt;Roethlisberger, F. J. (F, et al. Management and the Worker; an Account of a Research Program Conducted by the Western Electric Company, Hawthorne Works, Chicago,. Cambridge, Mass.,: Harvard university press, 1939. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the rational theory of motivation, people are not driven toward economic interests per the natural system. For instance, the straight piecework system pays employees based on each unit of their output. Based on studies such as the Bank Wiring Observation Room, using a piece rate incentive system does not lead to higher production.&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; Employees actually set upper limits on each person's daily output. These actions stand “in direct opposition to the ideas underlying their system of financial incentive, which countenanced no upper limit to performance other than physical capacity.”&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; Therefore, as opposed to the rational system that depends on economic rewards and punishments, the natural system of management assumes that humans are also motivated by non-economic factors.

====Autonomy: increased motivation for autonomous tasks====
Employees seek autonomy and responsibility in their work, contrary to assumptions of the rational theory of management. Because supervisors have direct authority over employees, they must ensure that the employee's actions are in line with the standards of efficient conduct.&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; This creates a sense of restriction on the employee and these constraints are viewed as “annoying and seemingly functioned only as subordinating or differentiating mechanisms."&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; Accordingly, the natural management system assumes that employees prefer autonomy and responsibility on the job and dislike arbitrary rules and overwhelming supervision. An individual's motivation to complete a task is increased when this task is autonomous. When the motivation to complete a task comes from an "external pressure" that pressure then "undermines" a person's motivation, and as a result decreases a persons desire to complete the task. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing Motivation|last=Walton, Cohen|first=Gregory, Geoffrey|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rational motivations===
The idea that human beings are rational and [[human behavior]] is guided by reason is an old one. However, recent research (on [[satisficing]] for example) has significantly undermined the idea of [[homo economicus]] or of [[perfect rationality]] in favour of a more [[bounded rationality]]. The field of [[Behavioural Economics|behavioural economics]] is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motivation|url=http://panoramaconsulting.co.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=2|website=panoramaconsulting.co.ke|accessdate=8 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103070653/http://panoramaconsulting.co.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=2|archivedate=3 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation===
Motivation can be divided into two different theories known as ''intrinsic'' (internal or inherent) motivation and ''extrinsic'' (external) motivation.

====Intrinsic motivation====
{{See also|Flow (psychology)|Ikigai}}
Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the early 1970s. Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge.&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. L. | year = 2000| title = Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 68–78 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for consideration. The phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within experimental studies of animal behavior. In these studies, it was evident that the organisms would engage in playful and curiosity-driven behaviors in the absence of [[reward system|reward]]. Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and is a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryan |first=Richard |author2=Edward L. Deci |title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Classic Definitions and New Directions |journal=[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] |year=2000 |volume=25  | issue = 1 |pages=54–67 |doi=10.1006/ceps.1999.1020 |pmid=10620381 |citeseerx=10.1.1.318.808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two necessary elements for intrinsic motivation are [[self-determination]] and an increase in perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behavior |last=L. |first=Deci, Edward |others=Ryan, Richard M. |isbn=9781489922717 |location=New York |oclc=861705534 |date = 2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the cause of the behavior must be internal, known as internal local of causality, and the individual who engages in the behavior must perceive that the task increases their competence.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; 

Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wigfield | first1 = A. | last2 = Guthrie | first2 = J. T. | last3 = Tonks | first3 = S. | last4 = Perencevich | first4 = K. C. | year = 2004 | title = Children's motivation for reading: Domain specificity and instructional influences | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Research | volume = 97 | issue = 6| pages = 299–309 | doi=10.3200/joer.97.6.299-310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are likely to be intrinsically motivated if they...
* attribute their educational results to factors under their own control, also known as autonomy or [[locus of control]]
* believe they have the skills to be effective agents in reaching their desired goals, also known as [[self-efficacy]] beliefs
* are interested in mastering a topic, not just in achieving good grades

An example of intrinsic motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional because he or she wants to learn about how computer users interact with computer networks. The employee has the intrinsic motivation to gain more knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=N Root III |first1=George |title=Examples of Intrinsic Workplace Motivation |url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-intrinsic-workplace-motivation-11382.html |website=Chron |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art for art's sake]] is an example of intrinsic motivation in the domain of art.

Traditionally, researchers thought of motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin Lowry | first1 = Paul | last2 = Gaskin | first2 = James | last3 = Twyman | first3 = Nathan W. | last4 = Hammer | first4 = Bryan | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Tom L. | year = 2013 | title = Taking 'fun and games' seriously: Proposing the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) | ssrn = 2177442 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 11| pages = 617–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfil users' intrinsic motivations, include on-line gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Wang |first2=Huchen |title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement |journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=487–506 |doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and general gamification. Even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered.

Not only can intrinsic motivation be used in a personal setting, but it can also be implemented and utilized in a social environment. Instead of attaining mature desires, such as those presented above via internet which can be attained on one's own, intrinsic motivation can be used to assist extrinsic motivation to attain a goal. For example, Eli, a 4-year-old with autism, wants to achieve the goal of playing with a toy train&lt;ref&gt;StoryStudio, . "One type of therapy is addressing autism, dementia, and so much more." San Francisco Gate, California Applied Behavior Analysis , 4 Aug. 2017, blog.sfgate.com/storystudio/2017/08/04/one-type-of-therapy-is-tackling-autism-dementia-and-so-much-more/. Accessed 15 Nov. 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;. To get the toy, he must first communicate to his therapist that he wants it. His desire to play is strong enough to be considered intrinsic motivation because it is a natural feeling, and his desire to communicate with his therapist to get the train can be considered extrinsic motivation because the outside object is a reward (see incentive theory). Communicating with the therapist is the first, slightly more challenging goal that stands in the way of achieving his larger goal of playing with the train. Achieving these goals in attainable pieces is also known as the [[goal-setting theory]]. 

''Advantages'': Intrinsic motivation can be long-lasting and self-sustaining.  Efforts to build this kind of motivation are also typically efforts at promoting student learning.  Such efforts often focus on the subject rather than rewards or punishments.

''Disadvantages'': Efforts at fostering intrinsic motivation can be slow to affect behavior and can require special and lengthy preparation.  Students are individuals, so a variety of approaches may be needed to motivate different students. It is often helpful to know what interests one's students in order to connect these interests with the subject matter. This requires getting to know one's students. Also, it helps if the instructor is interested in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motivating Students|url=http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/motivating-students/|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extrinsic motivation====
{{See also|Goal orientation}}
Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. L. |year = 2000 | title = Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 68–78 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68| citeseerx = 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common extrinsic motivations are [[reward system|rewards]] (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.&lt;ref name=Motivation&gt;{{cite web |last=Dewani |first=Vijay |title=Motivation |url=http://www.slideshare.net/vijaydewani7/motivation-15959567 |publisher=slideshare |accessdate=22 March 2013|date=2013-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most simple distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is the type of reasons or goals that lead to an action. While intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, extrinsic motivation, refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome. Extrinsic motivation thus contrasts with intrinsic motivation, which is doing an activity simply for the enjoyment of the activity itself, instead of for its instrumental value. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1006/ceps.1999.1020| pmid=10620381|title = Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Classic Definitions and New Directions| journal=Contemporary Educational Psychology| volume=25| issue=1| pages=54–67|year = 2000|last1 = Ryan|first1 = Richard M.| last2=Deci| first2=Edward L.| citeseerx=10.1.1.318.808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social psychological research has indicated that extrinsic rewards can lead to [[overjustification effect|overjustification]] and a subsequent reduction in intrinsic motivation. In one study demonstrating this effect, children who expected to be (and were) rewarded with a ribbon and a gold star for drawing pictures spent less time playing with the drawing materials in subsequent observations than children who were assigned to an unexpected reward condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lepper | first1 = Mark R. | last2 = Greene | first2 = David | last3 = Nisbet | first3 = Richard | year = 1973 | title = Undermining Children's Intrinsic Interest with Extrinsic Reward; A Test of 'Overjustification' Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 129–37 | doi=10.1037/h0035519}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another study showed that third graders who were rewarded with a book showed more reading behavior in the future, implying that some rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marinak | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Gambrell | first2 = Linda B. | year = 2008 | title = Intrinsic Motivation and Rewards: What Sustains Young Children's Engagement with Text? | url = | journal = Literacy Research and Instruction | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 9–26 | doi=10.1080/19388070701749546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the provision of extrinsic rewards might reduce the desirability of an activity, the use of extrinsic constraints, such as the threat of punishment, against performing an activity has actually been found to increase one's intrinsic interest in that activity. In one study, when children were given mild threats against playing with an attractive toy, it was found that the threat actually served to increase the child's interest in the toy, which was previously undesirable to the child in the absence of threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Lassiter | first2 = G. D. | year = 1982 | title = Increasing intrinsic interest with superfluous extrinsic constraints | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 811–819 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.5.811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Flow theory''' ===
Desirable subjective state a person experiences when completely involved in some challenging activity that matches the individual skill.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation : biological, psychological, environmental|last=Lambert.|first=Deckers|date=2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292027999|oclc=1040982893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“A state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”

– Csikszentmihalyi, 1990&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-father-of-flow/|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: All About Flow &amp; Positive Psychology|date=2016-12-16|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow theory, the idea of flow theory as first conceptualized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow in the context of motivation can be seen as an activity that is not too hard, frustrating or madding, or too easy boring and done too fast. If one has achieved perfect flow, then the activity has reached maximum potential. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Flow is part of something called positive psychology of the psychology of happiness. Positive psychology looks into what makes a person happy. Flow can be considered as achieving happiness or at the least positive feelings. A study that was published in the journal ''Emotion'' looked at flow experienced in college students playing Tetris. The students that they were being evaluated on looks then told to wait and play Tetris. There were three categories; Easy, normal, and hard. The students that played Tetris on normal level experienced flow and were less stressed about the evaluation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/11/05/662212524/cant-stop-worrying-try-tetris-to-ease-your-mind|title=Can't Stop Worrying? Try Tetris To Ease Your Mind|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Csikszentmihalyi describes 8 characteristics of flow as a complete concentration on the task, clarity of goals and reward in mind and immediate feedback, transformation of time (speeding up/slowing down of time), the experience is intrinsically rewarding, effortlessness and ease, there is a balance between challenge and skills, actions and awareness are merged, losing self-conscious rumination, there is a feeling of control over the task.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The activity no longer becomes something seen as a means to an end and it becomes something an individual wants to do. This can be seen as someone who likes to run for the sheer joy of running and not because they need to do it for exercise or because they want to brag about it. Peak flow can be different for each person. It could take an individual years to reach flow or only moments. If an individual becomes too good at an activity they can become bored. If the challenge becomes too hard then the individual could become discouraged and want to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/one-among-many/201502/flow-and-happiness|title=Flow and Happiness|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviorist theories===

While many theories on motivation have a [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] perspective, [[Behaviorism|behaviorists]] focus only on observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, that may not be observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson|Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.

====Classical and operant conditioning====
{{Main article|Motivational salience}}
In [[Classical conditioning|classical (or respondent) conditioning]], behavior is understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be ''unconditioned'', such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning might be seen as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Behavior Analysis|last = Cooper|first = John O|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-13-129327-4|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning and Complex Behavior|last = Donahoe|first = J.W.|publisher = Ledgetop Publishing|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-9762371-0-5|location = Richmond, MA, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.

In [[operant conditioning]], the type and frequency of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, in the presence of a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a [[Reinforcement|reinforcer]]), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a [[Punishment (psychology)|punisher]]), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future ([[positive reinforcement]]); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future ([[negative punishment]]). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention ([[positive punishment]]), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention ([[negative reinforcement]]).

The strength of reinforcement or punishment is dependent on [[Schedules of reinforcement|schedule]] and timing. A reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior. A behavior that is reinforced intermittently, at unpredictable intervals, will be more robust and persistent, compared to one that is reinforced every time the behavior is performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished a week after the troublesome behavior, that might not affect future behavior.

In addition to these basic principles, [[Stimulus control|environmental stimuli also affect behavior]]. Behavior is punished or reinforced in the context of whatever stimuli were present just before the behavior was performed, which means that a particular behavior might not be affected in every environmental context, or situation, after it is punished or reinforced in one specific context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A lack of praise for school-related behavior might, for instance, not decrease after-school sports-related behavior that is usually reinforced by praise.

The various mechanisms of operant conditioning may be used to understand the motivation for various behaviors by examining what happens just after the behavior (the consequence), in what context the behavior is performed or not performed (the antecedent), and under what circumstances (motivating operators).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=====Incentive motivation=====
{{hatnote|Main section: {{sectionlink|Motivational salience|Incentive salience}}}}
Incentive theory is a specific theory of motivation, derived partly from behaviorist principles of reinforcement, which concerns an incentive or motive to do something. The most common incentive would be a compensation. Compensation can be tangible or intangible, It helps in motivating the employees in their corporate life, students in academics and inspire to do more and more to achieve profitability in every field. Studies show that if the person receives the [[reward system|reward]] immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens.&lt;ref name="Rani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Rani|first1 = Rekha|last2 = Kumar-Lenka|first2 = Sameer|title = Motivation and Work Motivation: Concepts, Theories &amp; Researches|journal = International Journal of Research in IT &amp; Management|date = August 2012|volume = 2|issue = 8|pages = 4–6|url = http://www.euroasiapub.org/download.php?filename=iWv27FSHKOjyv8v.pdf&amp;new=3.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924003143/http://www.euroasiapub.org/download.php?filename=iWv27FSHKOjyv8v.pdf&amp;new=3.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-09-24|accessdate = August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive action-reward combination can cause the action to become a habit.&lt;ref name="Rani" /&gt;

"Reinforcers and reinforcement principles of behavior differ from the hypothetical construct of reward." A reinforcer is anything that follows an action, with the intentions that the action will now occur more frequently. From this perspective, the concept of distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is irrelevant.

Incentive theory in psychology treats motivation and behavior of the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities that are expected to be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received people are more likely to act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.

Incentive theory distinguishes itself from other motivation theories, such as drive theory, in the direction of the motivation. In incentive theory, stimuli "attract" a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus. In terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier. As opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment—the lack of homeostasis in the body. For example, a person has come to know that if they eat when hungry, it will eliminate that negative feeling of hunger, or if they drink when thirsty, it will eliminate that negative feeling of thirst.&lt;ref name="Rani" /&gt;

====Motivating operations====
[[Motivating operation]]s, MOs, relate to the field of motivation in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence ''future behavior''. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.

Motivating operations are factors that affect learned behavior in a certain context. MOs have two effects: a '''value-altering effect''', which increases or decreases the efficiency of a reinforcer, and a '''behavior-altering effect''', which modifies learned behavior that has previously been punished or reinforced by a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When a motivating operation causes an increase in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or amplifies a learned behavior in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration or speed of the behavior), it functions as an '''establishing operation, EO'''. A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation). The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.

Conversely, a motivating operation that causes a decrease in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an '''abolishing operation, AO.''' Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.

====Motivation and psychotherapy====
{{See also|Motivational interviewing}}
Motivation lies at the core of many behaviorist approaches to psychological treatment. A person with [[Autism spectrum|autism-spectrum]] disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in the depressed individual. A patient with [[specific phobia]] is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement). In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as [[Early intensive behavior intervention|EIBI]] and [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] for major depression and specific phobia.

===Socio-cultural theory===
Sociocultural theory (see [[Cultural-historical psychology]]) (also known as Social Motivation) emphasizes impact of activity and actions mediated through social interaction, and within social contexts. Sociocultural theory represents a shift from traditional theories of motivation, which view the individual's innate drives or mechanistic operand learning as primary determinants of motivation.  Critical elements to socio-cultural theory applied to motivation include, but are not limited to, the role of social interactions and the contributions from culturally-based knowledge and practice.&lt;ref name="Rueda and Moll 1994"/&gt;  Sociocultural theory extends the social aspects of [[Cognitive Evaluation Theory]], which espouses the important role of positive feedback from others during action,&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000"/&gt; but requires the individual as the internal locus of causality.  Sociocultural theory predicts that motivation has an external locus of causality, and is socially distributed among the social group.&lt;ref name="Rueda and Moll 1994"/&gt; 

Motivation can develop through an individuals involvement within their cultural group. Personal motivation often comes from activities a person believes to be central to the everyday occurrences in their community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|date=2009|title=Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|url=|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|volume=|pages=102–138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of socio-cultural theory would be social settings where people work together to solve collective problems. Although individuals will have internalized goals, they will also develop internalized goals of others, as well as new interests and goals collectively with those that they feel socially connected to.&lt;ref name="Sharing Motivation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Gregory|last2=Cohen|first2=Geoffrey|date=2011|title=Sharing Motivation|journal=Social Motivation|pages=79–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, it is believed that all cultural groups are motivated in the same way. However, motivation can come from different child-rearing practices and cultural behaviors that greatly vary between cultural groups. 

In some indigenous cultures, collaboration between children and adults in community and household tasks is seen as very important &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=|year=January 2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child from an indigenous community may spend a great deal of their time alongside family and community members doing different tasks and chores that benefit the community. After having seen the benefits of collaboration and work, and also having the opportunity to be included, the child will be intrinsically motivated to participate in similar tasks. In this example, because the adults in the community do not impose the tasks upon the children, the children therefore feel self-motivated and a desire to participate and learn through the task. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray, Bowen, Segura, Verdugo|first=Marjorie, Sofia, Nicole, Marisol|date=2015|title=Apprehending Volition in Early Socialization: Raising "Little Persons" among Rural Mapuche Families|url=|journal=Ethos|volume=43|pages=376–401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the community values that surround the child, their source of motivation may vary from a different community with different values. 

In more Westernized communities, where segregation between adults and children participating in work related task is a common practice. As a result of this, these adolescents demonstrate less internalized motivation to do things within their environment than their parents. However, when the motivation to participate in activities is a prominent belief within the family, the adolescents autonomy is significantly higher. This therefore demonstrating that when collaboration and non-segregative tasks are norms within a child's upbringing, their internal motivation to participate in community tasks increases. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gronhoj,Rhogersen|first=Alice, John|date=2017|title=Why young people do things for the environment: the role of parenting for adolescents motivation to engage in pro-environmental behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When given opportunities to work collaboratively with adults on shared tasks during childhood, children will therefore become more intrinsically motivated through adulthood. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Austin, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social motivation is tied to one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are much less likely to smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction does not need to be communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork.&lt;ref name="Sharing Motivation"/&gt; Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives.&lt;ref name="Sharing Motivation"/&gt; Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.

===Push and pull===
'''Push''' motivations are those where people push themselves towards their goals or to achieve something, such as the desire for escape, rest and relaxation, prestige, health and fitness, adventure, and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Testing the push and pull factors"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the push and pull factors | doi=10.1016/0160-7383(94)90091-4 | volume=21|issue=4 |journal=Annals of Tourism Research|pages=844–846|year=1994 | last1 = Uysal | first1 = Muzaffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with push motivation it's also easy to get discouraged when there are obstacles present in the path of achievement. Push motivation acts as a willpower and people's willpower is only as strong as the desire behind the willpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Push and Pull Motivation|url=http://toinspirewithin.com/2012/01/16/push-and-pull-motivation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a study has been conducted on social networking and its push and pull effects. One thing that is mentioned is "Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider."&lt;ref name="Chang, I. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = I. | last2 = Liu | first2 = C. | last3 = Chen | first3 = K. | year = 2014 | title = The push, pull and mooring effects in virtual migration for social networking sites | url = | journal = Information Systems Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 323–346 | doi = 10.1111/isj.12030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So from reading this, we now know that Push motivations can also be a negative force. In this case, that negative force is regret and dissatisfaction.

'''Pull''' motivation is the opposite of push. It is a type of motivation that is much stronger. "Some of the factors are those that emerge as a result of the attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image."&lt;ref name="Testing the push and pull factors"/&gt; Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That is why pull motivation is stronger than push motivation. It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire. 
It can also be an alternative force when compared to negative force. From the same study as previously mentioned, "Regret and dissatisfaction with an existing SNS service provider may trigger a heightened interest toward switching service providers, but such a motive will likely translate into reality in the presence of a good alternative. Therefore, alternative attractiveness can moderate the effects of regret and dissatisfaction with switching intention"&lt;ref name="Chang, I. 2014"/&gt; And so, pull motivation can be an attracting desire when negative influences come into the picture.

===Self-control===
{{main article|Self-control|Inhibitory control}}
The self-control aspect of motivation is increasingly considered to be a subset of [[emotional intelligence]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Theresa|title=Empathy: A Quantum Approach – The Psychical Influence of Emotion|date=February 6, 2012|isbn=9781105482885|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NwaVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=The+self-control+aspect+of+motivation+is+increasingly+considered+to+be+a+subset+of+emotional+intelligence#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20self-control%20aspect%20of%20motivation%20is%20increasingly%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20subset%20of%20emotional%20intelligence&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is suggested that although a person may be classed as highly intelligent (as measured by many traditional [[intelligence test]]s), they may remain unmotivated to pursue intellectual endeavours. [[Victor Vroom|Vroom's]] "[[expectancy theory]]" provides an account of when people may decide to exert self-control in pursuit of a particular goal.

===Drives===
{{main article|Drive theory}}
A drive or desire can be described as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive.&lt;ref name="Drive/Desire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drive|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drive?s=t|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.

Another basic drive is the [[sexual drive]] which like food motivates us because it is essential to our survival.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"&gt;Schacter, D.L., Gilbert, D.L. and Wegner, D.M. (2009,2011) Psychology. 2nd ed. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt; The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called [[Dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA).&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt; The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt; Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than women to think about sex.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt;

===Drive-reduction theory===
[[File:ClarkHull2.jpg|thumbnail|Clark Hull was the behaviorist who developed the drive-reduction theory of motivation.]]
[[Drive theory]] grows out of the concept that people have certain biological drives, such as hunger and thirst. As time passes the strength of the drive increases if it is not satisfied (in this case by eating). Upon satisfying a drive the drive's strength is reduced. Created by [[Clark Hull]]  and further developed by [[Kenneth Spence]], the theory became well known in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the motivational theories that arose during the 1950s and 1960s were either based on Hull's original theory or were focused on providing alternatives to the drive-reduction theory, including Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which emerged as an alternative to Hull's approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://psychology.about.com/od/motivation/a/drive-reduction-theory.htm | title=How Does Drive Reduction Theory Explain Human Motivation?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive theory has some intuitive or folk validity. For instance when preparing food, the drive model appears to be compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamlesh|first1=M. L.|title=Psychology in Physical Education and Sport|date=Jan 12, 2011|publisher=Pinnacle Technology|isbn=9781618202482|url=https://books.google.com/?id=up-Bc_E_w9UC&amp;pg=PT328&amp;lpg=PT328&amp;dq=Drive+theory+has+some+intuitive+or+folk+validity.+For+instance+when+preparing+food,+the+drive+model+appears+to+be+compatible+with+sensations+of+rising+hunger+as+the+food+is+prepared,+and,+after+the+food+has+been+consumed,+a+decrease+in+subjective+hunger#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
{{Main article|Cognitive dissonance}}
Suggested by [[Leon Festinger]], cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on the world around them, and their own personal feelings and actions.&lt;ref name=Rani/&gt; For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.

While not a theory of motivation, per se, the theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a [[drive theory|motivational drive]] to reduce dissonance. The [[cognitive miser]] perspective makes people want to justify things in a simple way in order to reduce the effort they put into cognition.  They do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or actions, rather than facing the inconsistencies, because dissonance is a mental strain. Dissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying. It is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in [[social psychology]].

===Content theories===
The content theory was one of the earliest theories of motivation. Content theories can also be referred to needs theories, because the theory focuses on the importance of what motivates people (needs). In other words, they try to identify what are the "needs" and how they relate to motivation to fulfill those needs. Another definition could be defined by Pritchard and Ashwood, is the process used to allocate energy to maximize the satisfaction of needs.&lt;ref name=Pritchard2008&gt;{{cite book |last=R. Pritchard &amp; E. Ashwood |title=Managing Motivation |year=2008 |page=6 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group |location=New York |isbn=978-1-84169-789-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maslow's hierarchy of needs====
[[File:Aspiration Management.jpg|thumb|Maslow's Pyramid]]
[[Content theory]] of human motivation includes both [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|hierarchy of needs]] and [[Frederick Herzberg|Herzberg]]'s two-factor theory. Maslow's theory is one of the most widely discussed theories of motivation. Abraham Maslow believed that man is inherently good and argued that individuals possess a constantly growing inner drive that has great potential. The needs hierarchy system, devised by Maslow (1954), is a commonly used scheme for classifying human motives.&lt;ref&gt;Pardee, R. L. (1990). The basic concept behind the hierarchy system is that it's like a food pyramid. Everybody starts at the bottom of the pyramid and are motivated to satisfy each level in the ascending order to work our way to the top of the pyramid, and those levels (needs) are categorized into two main groups with five difference sections which are explained below. Motivation Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor &amp; McClelland. A Literature Review of Selected Theories Dealing with Job Satisfaction and Motivation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American motivation psychologist Abraham H. Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs consisting of five hierarchic classes. According to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs. 
The needs, listed from basic (lowest-earliest) to most complex (highest-latest) are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Content Theories of Motivation|url=https://sielearning.tafensw.edu.au/MBA/9791F/BusinessServices/LO/1207_020138_605F_02_wi/1207_020138_605F_0204_wi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Physiology]] ([[hunger]], [[thirst]], [[sleep]], etc.)
* [[Safety]]/[[Security]]/[[Shelter (building)|Shelter]]/[[Health]]
* [[Social]]/[[Love]]/[[Friendship]]
* [[Self-esteem]]/[[Recognition (sociology)|Recognition]]/Achievement
* [[Self actualization]]/achievement of full [[potential]]
The basic requirements build upon the first step in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory can be summarized as follows:
* Human beings have wants and desires which influence their behavior. Only unsatisfied needs influence behavior, satisfied needs do not.
* Needs are arranged in order of importance to human life, from the basic to the complex.
* The person advances to the next level of needs only after the lower level need is at least minimally satisfied.
* The further the progress up the hierarchy, the more individuality, humanness and psychological health a person will show.

====Sex, Hedonism, and Evolution====
        
One of the first influential figures to discuss the topic of Hedonism was Socrates, and he did so around 470- 399 BC in ancient Greece. Hedonism, as Socrates described it, is the motivation wherein a person will behave in a manner that will maximize pleasure and minimize pain. The only instance in which a person will behave in a manner that results in more pain than pleasure is when the knowledge of the effects of the behavior is lacking. Sex is one of the pleasures people pursue.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deckers |first1=Lambert |title=Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017 |isbn=9781138036321 |page=30–38, 71–75 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chandler, H. (1975). Hedonism. American Philosophical Quarterly, 12(3), 223-233. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/20009578&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Sex is on the first level of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. It is a necessary physiological need, like air, warmth, or sleep, and if the body lacks it will not function optimally. Without the orgasm that comes with sex, a person will experience “pain,” and as Hedonism would predict, a person will minimize this pain by pursuing sex. That being said, sex as a basic need is different from the need for sexual intimacy, which is located on the third level in Maslow's Hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
	
There are multiple theories for why sex is a strong motivation, and many fall under the Theory of Evolution. On an evolutionary level, the motivation for sex likely has to do with a species’ ability to reproduce. Species that reproduce more, survive and pass on their genes. Therefore, species have sexual desire that leads to sexual intercourse as a means to create more offspring. Without this innate motivation, a species may determine that attaining intercourse is too costly in terms of effort, energy, and danger.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2018). Heterosexual Men’s Sexual Desire: Supported by, or Deviating from, Traditional Masculinity Norms and Sexual Scripts? Sex Roles, 78(1), 130-141.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In addition to sexual desire, the motivation for romantic love runs parallel in having an evolutionary function for the survival of a species. On an emotional level, romantic love satiates a psychological need for belonging. Therefore, this is another hedonistic pursuit of pleasure. From the evolutionary perspective, romantic love creates bonds with the parents of offspring. This bond will make it so that the parents will stay together and take care and protect the offspring until it is independent. By rearing the child together, it increases the chances that the offspring will survive and pass on its genes itself, therefore continuing the survival of the species. Without the romantic love bond, the male will pursue satiation of his sexual desire with as many mates as possible, leaving behind the female to rear the offspring by herself. Child rearing with one parent is more difficult and provides less assurance that the offspring survives than with two parents. Romantic love therefore solves the commitment problem of parents needing to be together; individuals that are loyal and faithful to on another will have mutual survival benefits.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzaga, G., Turner, R., Keltner, D., Campos, B., Altemus, M., Davidson, Richard J., &amp;Scherer, Klaus R. (2006). Romantic Love and Sexual Desire in Close Relationships. Emotion, 6(2), 163-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzaga, G. C., Keltner, D. A., Londahl, E. D., &amp; Smith, M. (2001). Love and the commitment problem in romantic relations and friendship. Journal of Personality and Social	Psychology, 81(2), 247-262.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Additionally, under the umbrella of evolution, is Darwin's term sexual selection. This refers to how the female selects the male for reproduction. The male is motivated to attain sex because of all the aforementioned reasons, but how he attains it can vary based on his qualities. For some females, they are motivated by the will to survive mostly, and will prefer a mate that can physically defend her, or financially provide for her (among humans). Some females are more attracted to charm, as it is an indicator of being a good loyal lover that will in turn make for a dependable child rearing partner. Altogether, sex is a hedonistic pleasure seeking behavior that satiates physical and psychological needs and is instinctively guided by principles of evolution. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hosken, David J. ; House, Clarissa M. Sexual Selection. Current Biology. Volume 21, Issue 2,	Pages R62-R65&lt;/ref&gt;



====Herzberg's two-factor theory====
{{Main article|Two-factor theory}}
[[File:Two factor theory.png|thumb|Two-factor theory]]
[[Frederick Herzberg]]'s two-factor theory concludes that certain factors in the workplace result in [[job satisfaction]], but if absent, they don't lead to dissatisfaction but no satisfaction. The factors that motivate people can change over their lifetime, but "respect for me as a person" is one of the top motivating factors at any stage of life.

He distinguished between:
* '''Motivators''' (e.g. challenging work, recognition, responsibility) which give positive satisfaction, and
* '''Hygiene factors''' (e.g. status, [[job security]], [[salary]] and fringe benefits) that do not motivate if present, but, if absent, result in demotivation.

Herzberg concluded that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction were the products of two separate factors: motivating factors (satisfiers) and hygiene factors (dissatisfiers).

Some motivating factors (satisfiers) were: Achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth.

Some hygiene factors (dissatisfiers) were: company policy, supervision, working conditions, interpersonal relations, salary, status, job security, and personal life.&lt;ref name="Pardee, R. L. 1990"&gt;Pardee, R. L. (1990). Motivation Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor &amp; McClelland. A Literature Review of Selected Theories Dealing with Job Satisfaction and Motivation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name hygiene factors is used because, like hygiene, the presence will not improve health, but absence can cause health deterioration.

Herzberg's theory has found application in such occupational fields as information systems and in studies of user satisfaction such as [[computer user satisfaction]].

====Alderfer's ERG theory====
{{Main article|ERG theory}}
[[Clayton Alderfer|Alderfer]], expanding on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, created the ''ERG theory''. This theory posits that there are three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2392201|title = Three Studies of Measures of Need Satisfaction in Organizations|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|volume = 18|issue = 4|pages = 489–505|last1 = Schneider|first1 = Benjamin|last2 = Alderfer|first2 = Clayton P.|year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.

====Self-determination theory====
{{Main article|Self-determination theory}}
Since the early 1970s Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1971_Deci.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have conducted research that eventually led to the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT). This theory focuses on the degree to which an individual's behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined. SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence,&lt;ref name="Harter, S. 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harter | first1 = S | year = 1978 | title = Effectance motivation reconsidered: Toward a developmental model | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 661–669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White, R.

These three psychological needs motivate the self to initiate specific behaviour and mental nutriments that are essential for psychological health and well-being.  When these needs are satisfied, there are positive consequences, such as well-being and growth, leading people to be motivated, productive and happy. When they are thwarted, people's motivation, productivity and happiness plummet.&lt;ref&gt;http://sdtheory.s3.amazonaws.com/SDT/documents/2000_DeciRyan_PIWhatWhy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three essential elements to the theory:&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E.

* Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drive and emotions).
* Humans have an inherent tendency towards growth, development and integrated functioning.
* Optimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they do not happen automatically.

===Temporal motivation theory===
{{Main article|Temporal motivation theory}}
A recent approach in developing a broad, integrative theory of motivation is temporal motivation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/~steel/images/Integrating.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027140206/http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/~steel/images/Integrating.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced in a 2006 ''Academy of Management Review'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steel|first=Piers|author2=C.

It simplifies the field of motivation and allows findings from one theory to be translated into terms of another.

Miller]] award for outstanding contribution to general science.

::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Motivation} = \frac{\mbox{Expectancy × Value}}{\mbox{1 + Impulsiveness × Delay}}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Motivation''' is the desire for a particular outcome, '''Expectancy''' or [[self-efficacy]] is the probability of success, '''Value''' is the reward associated with the outcome, '''Impulsiveness''' is the individual's sensitivity to delay and '''Delay''' is the time to realization.&lt;ref name=Steel2007 /&gt;

===Achievement motivation===
Achievement motivation is an integrative perspective based on the premise that performance motivation results from the way broad components of personality are directed towards performance. As a result, it includes a range of dimensions that are relevant to success at work but which are not conventionally regarded as being part of performance motivation. The emphasis on performance seeks to integrate formerly separate approaches as [[need for achievement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=A Theory of Achievement Motivation|year=1974|publisher=Krieger Pub Co|isbn=978-0-88275-166-5|edition=6|author2=Norman Feather}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with, for example, social motives like dominance. Personality is intimately tied to performance and achievement motivation, including such characteristics as tolerance for risk, fear of failure, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Achievement Motive and Text Anxiety Conceived as Motive to Approach Success and Motive to Avoid Failure|year=1960|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Company|author2=George H. Litwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Personality, Motivation and Achievement|year=1978|publisher=Hemisphere Pub. Corp|isbn=978-0-470-99336-1|author2=Joel O. Raynor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiversity:Motivation and emotion/Book/2011/Achievement motivation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Achievement motivation can be measured by The Achievement Motivation Inventory, which is based on this theory and assesses three factors (in 17 separated scales) relevant to vocational and professional success. This motivation has repeatedly been linked with adaptive motivational patterns, including working hard, a willingness to pick learning tasks with much difficulty, and attributing success to effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xiang | first1 = P. | last2 = McBride | first2 = R. | last3 = Guan | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Children's motivation in elementary physical education: A longitudinal study | url = | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 71–80 | doi=10.1080/02701367.2004.10609135| pmid = 15532363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achievement motivation was studied intensively by [[David C. McClelland]], [[John William Atkinson|John W. Atkinson]] and their colleagues since the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClelland|first=David|title=The Achievement Motive|year=1953|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of motivation is a drive that is developed from an emotional state. One may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure. In achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in what they do and not think much about the failures or the negatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Covington | first1 = M. V. | year = 2000 | title = Goal theory, motivation, and school achievement: An integrative review | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 171–200 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.171 | pmid=10751969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture.  There are three major characteristics of people who have a great need to achieve according to McClelland's research.
#They would prefer a work environment in which they are able to assume responsibility for solving problems.
#They would take calculated risk and establish moderate, attainable goals.
#They want to hear continuous recognition, as well as feedback, in order for them to know how well they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz &amp; Schultz|first=Duane|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-81-317-3370-7|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive theories===
[[Cognitive]] theories define motivation in terms of how people think about situations. Cognitive theories of motivation include goal-setting theory and expectancy theory.

====Goal-setting theory====
{{Main article|Goal-setting theory}}
Goal-setting theory is based on the notion that individuals sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a [[reward system|reward]] in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the [[SMART criteria]], in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Time management is an important aspect to consider, when regarding time as a factor contributing to goal achievement. Having too much time allows area for distraction and procrastination, which simultaneously distracts the subject by steering his or her attention away from the original goal. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Strategies and Learning Styles|last=Entwistle|first=Noel|date=1988|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9781489921208|series=Perspectives on Individual Differences|pages=21–51|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2118-5_2|chapter = Motivational Factors in Students' Approaches to Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an overly restricting time restraint, the subject could potentially feel overwhelmed, which could deter the subject from achieving the goal because the amount of time provided is not sufficient or rational.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fried|first=Yitzhak|last2=Slowik|first2=Linda Haynes|date=2004|title=Enriching Goal-Setting Theory with Time: An Integrated Approach|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=29|issue=3|pages=404–422|doi=10.2307/20159051|jstor=20159051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master [[algebra]]. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial [[probability]] that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similarly to [[Maslow]]'s Hierarchy of Needs, a larger end goal is easier to achieve if the subject has smaller, more attainable yet still challenging goals to achieve first in order to advance over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A classic example of a poorly specified goal is trying to motivate oneself to run a [[marathon]] when s/he has not had proper training. A smaller, more attainable goal is to first motivate oneself to take the stairs instead of an elevator or to replace a stagnant activity, like watching television, with a mobile one, like spending time walking and eventually working up to a jog. '''Note: all goals are subject to the individual's skills and abilities.'''

=== '''Procrastination'''- ===
to voluntarily postpone or delay an intended course of action despite anticipating that you will be worse off because of that delay. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Procrastination can be seen as a defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hub.rockyview.ab.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=260&amp;chapterid=324|title=Defense Mechanisms: Procrastination|website=hub.rockyview.ab.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When something is put off or will be done at a later time it can be seen as one is protecting one's self from failure. It is creating an excuse for why one didn’t do well on something Take for example a term paper, it is overwhelming, and one is not sure that it can be completed correctly. If one puts it off until the last minute, then one can say that they did not do a good job on it because they didn’t have enough time. Procrastination can be seen as creating a buffer or an excuse to cover up inadequacies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-procrastination-equation/201207/lying-and-procrastination|title=Lying and Procrastination|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expectancy theory====
{{Main article|Expectancy theory}}
Expectancy theory was proposed by Victor H. Vroom in 1964. Expectancy theory explains the behavior process in which an individual selects a behavior option over another, and why/how this decision is made in relation to their goal.

There's also an equation for this theory which goes as follows: 
::&lt;math&gt;{\text{M}}= {\text{E}} \times {\text{I}} \times {\text{V}}&lt;/math&gt; or 
::&lt;math&gt;{\text{Motivation}}= {\text{Expectancy}} \times {\text{Instrumentality}} \times {\text{Valence}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="analytictech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theories of Motivation|url=http://www.analytictech.com/mb021/motivation.htm|website=analytictech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*M (Motivation) is the amount an individual will be motivated by the condition or environment they placed themselves in. Which is based from the following hence the equation.
*E (Expectancy) is the person's perception that effort will result in performance. In other words, it's the person assessment of how well and what kind of effort will relate in better performance.
*I (Instrumentality) is the person's perception that performance will be rewarded or punished.
*V (Valence) is the perceived amount of the reward or punishment that will result from the performance."&lt;ref name="analytictech.com"/&gt;

===Models of behavior change===
{{See also|Cognitive control}}
Social-cognitive models of behavior change include the constructs of motivation and [[volition (psychology)|volition]]. Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral [[intention]]s. Volition is seen as a process that leads from intention to actual behavior. In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in [[orchestration]] to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived [[self-efficacy]]. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.

[[John William Atkinson|John W. Atkinson]], David Birch and their colleagues developed the theory of "Dynamics of Action" to mathematically model change in behavior as a consequence of the interaction of motivation and associated tendencies toward specific actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=The Dynamics of Action|year=1970|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-03624-1|author2=David Birch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhl|first=Julius|title=Motivation, Thought, and Action|year=1986|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-275-92096-8|author2=John W. Atkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The theory posits that change in behavior occurs when the tendency for a new, unexpressed behavior becomes dominant over the tendency currently motivating action.  In the theory, the strength of tendencies rises and falls as a consequence of internal and external stimuli (sources of instigation), inhibitory factors, and consummatory in factors such as performing an action. In this theory, there are three causes responsible for behavior and change in behavior:
# Instigation (Ts) – increases tendency when an activity has intrinsic ability to satisfy;
# Inhibition (Taf) – decreases tendency when there are obstacles to performing an activity; and
# Consummation – decreases a tendency as it is performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Introduction to Motivation|year=1978|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company|location=New York|author2=David Birch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=J|title=Understanding motivation and emotion|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thematic apperception test===
{{Main article|Thematic apperception test}}
Psychologists [[David C. McClelland]] and [[John William Atkinson|John W. Atkinson]] argued that motivation should be unconscious. They refined measures of motivation by means of [[content analysis]] of [[Imagination|imaginative thought]] using, for example, the Thematic Apperception Test.'&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel 2011. p.340"&gt;Schacter, Daniel.

===Intrinsic motivation and the 16 basic desires theory===
Starting from studies involving more than 6,000 people, Professor [[Steven Reiss]] has proposed a theory that found 16 basic desires that guide nearly all human behavior.&lt;ref name="Reiss New Theory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.osu.edu/news/2000/06/28/whoami/|title=New Theory of Motivation Lists 16 Basic Desires That Guide Us|last=|first=|date=2000-06-28|work=Research News|publisher=[[Ohio State]]|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Reiss | first1 = Steven | title = Who am I?

It is about reaching the most possible potential as a human being.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 16 basic desires that motivate our actions and define our personalities are:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Acceptance]], the need for approval

* [[Family]], the need to raise children
* [[Honor]], the need to be loyal to the traditional values of one's clan/ethnic group
* [[Idealism]], the need for social justice

* [[Social status]], the need for social standing/importance
* [[Tranquility]], the need to be safe
* [[Vengeance (concept)|Vengeance]], the need to strike back and to compete
}}

===Attribution theory===
{{Main article|Attribution (psychology)}}
Attribution theory is a theory developed by psychologist, [[Fritz Heider]] that describes the processes by which individuals explain the causes of their behavior and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassin|first=Saul|title=Social Psychology|year=2007|publisher=Wadsworth: Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0618868469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of attribution theory developed by psychologist, [[Bernard Weiner]] describes an individual's beliefs about how the causes of success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. Bernard Weiner's theory can be defined into two perspectives: intrapersonal or interpersonal.  The intrapersonal perspective includes self-directed thoughts and emotions that are attributed to the self. The interpersonal perspective includes beliefs about the responsibility of others and other directed affects of emotions; the individual would place the blame on another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|title=Interpersonal and intrapersonal theories of motivation from an attributional perspective|journal=Educational Psychology Review|year=2000|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals formulate explanatory attributions to understand the events they experience and to seek reasons for their failures. When individuals seek positive feedback from their failures, they use the feedback as motivation to show improved performances. For example, using the intrapersonal perspective, a student who failed a test may attribute their failure for not studying enough and would use their emotion of shame or embarrassment as motivation to study harder for the next test. A student who blames their test failure on the teacher would be using the interpersonal perspective, and would use their feeling of disappointment as motivation to rely on a different study source other than the teacher for the next test.

===Approach versus avoidance===
{{Main article|Motivational salience}}
Approach motivation (i.e., [[incentive salience]]) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is [[reward system|rewarded]] or results in a positive or desirable outcome. In contrast, avoidance motivation (i.e., [[aversive salience]]) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a [[aversives|negative or undesirable outcome]].&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel 2011. p.340"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Andrew J|last2=Covington|first2=Martin V|title=Approach and Avoidance Motivation|journal=Educational Psychology Review|date=2001|volume=13|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations tend to be more powerful than approach motivations. Because people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, they will take more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel 2011. p.340"/&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Conditioned taste aversion.&lt;/big&gt;'''

“A strong dislike (nausea reaction) for food because of prior Association with of that food with nausea or upset stomach.” &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Conditioned taste aversion is the only type of conditioning that only needs one exposure. It does not need to be the specific food or drinks that cause the taste. Conditioned taste aversion can also be attributed to extenuating circumstances. An example of this can be eating a rotten apple. Eating the apple then immediately throwing up. Now it is hard to even near an apple without feeling sick. Conditioned taste aversion can also come about by the mere associations of two stimuli. Eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but also have the flu. Eating the sandwich makes one feel nauseous, so one throws up, now one cannot smell peanut butter without feeling queasy. Though eating the sandwich does not cause one to through up, they are still linked.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Unconscious Motivation ===
In his book ''A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis'', Sigmund Freud explained his theory on the conscious-unconscious distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Renaissance Classics|year=2012|isbn=9781484156803|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this relationship, he used a two-room metaphor. The smaller of the two rooms is filled with a person's preconscious, which is the thoughts, emotions, and memories that are available to a person's consciousness. This room also houses a person's consciousness, which is the part of the preconscious that is the focus at that given time. Connected to the small room is a much larger room that houses a person's unconscious. This part of the mind is unavailable to a person's consciousness and consists of impulses and repressed thoughts. The door between these two rooms acts as the person's mental censor. It's job is to keep anxiety inducing thoughts and socially unacceptable behaviors or desires out of the preconscious. Freud describes the event of a thought or impulse being denied at the door as repression, one of the many defense mechanisms. This process is supposed to protect the individual from any embarrassment that could come from acting on these impulses or thoughts that exist in the unconscious.

In terms of motivation, Freud argues that unconscious instinctual impulses can still have great influence on behavior even though the person is not aware of the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation: Biological, Psychological, and Environmental|last=Deckers|first=Lambert|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138036338|location=|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these instincts serve as a motive, the person is only aware of the goal of the motive, and not its actual source. He divides these instincts into sexual instincts, death instincts, and ego or self-preservation instincts. Sexual instincts are those that motivate humans to stay alive and ensure the continuation of the mankind. On the other hand, Freud also maintains that humans have an inherent drive for self-destruction, or the death instinct. Similar to the devil and angel that everyone has on there should, the sexual instinct and death instinct are constantly battling each other to both be satisfied. The death instinct can be closely related to Freud's other concept, the id, which is our need to experience pleasure immediately, regardless of the consequences. The last type of instinct that contributes to motivation is the ego or self-preservation instinct. This instinct is geared towards assuring that a person feels validated in whatever behavior or thought they have. The mental censor, or door between the unconscious and preconscious, helps satisfy this instinct. For example, one may be sexually attracted to a person, due to their sexual instinct, but the self-preservation instinct prevents them to act on this urge until that person finds that it is socially acceptable to do so. Quite similarly to his psychic theory that deals with the id, ego, and superego, Freud's theory of instincts highlights the interdependence of these three instincts. All three instincts serve as a checks and balances system to control what instincts are acted on and what behaviors are used to satisfy as many of them at once.

'''Priming in the context of Motivation'''

Priming is a phenomenon, often used as an experimental technique, whereby a specific stimulus sensitizes the subject to later presentation of a similar stimulus. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/priming/|title=Priming {{!}} Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=2016-06-17|work=Encyclopedia of Psychology|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Priming refers to an increased sensitivity to certain stimuli, resulting from prior exposure to related visual or audio messages. When an individual is exposed to the word “cancer,” for example, and then offered the choice to smoke a cigarette, we expect that there is a greater probability that they will choose not to smoke as a result of the earlier exposure.”&lt;ref name="AutoRef1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elgendi |first=Mohamed |last2=Kumar |first2=Parmod |last3=Barbic |first3=Skye |last4=Howard |first4=Newton |last5=Abbott |first5=Derek |last6=Cichocki |first6=Andrzej |date=2018-05-30 |title=Subliminal Priming—State of the Art and Future Perspectives |journal=Behavioral Sciences |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=54 |doi=10.3390/bs8060054 |pmid=29849006 |pmc=6027235 |issn=2076-328X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priming can affect motivation, in the way that we can be motived to do things by an outside source. 

Priming can be linked with the mere exposer theory. People tend to like thing that they have exposed to before. Mere exposer theory is used by advertising companies to get people to buy their products. An example of this is seeing a picture of the product on a sign and then buying that product later. If an individual is in a room with two strangers they are more likely to gravitate towards the person that they occasionally pass on the street, then the person that they have never seen before. An example of the use of mere exposure theory can be seen in product placements in movies and TV shows. We see a product that our is in our favorite movie, and we are more inclined to buy that product when we see it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/mere-exposure-effect/|title=Mere Exposure Effect {{!}} Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=2016-06-17|work=Encyclopedia of Psychology|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priming can fit into these categories; Semantic Priming, Visual Priming, Response Priming, Perceptual and Conceptual Priming, Positive and Negative Priming, Associative and Context Priming, and Olfactory Priming. Visual and Semantic priming is the most used in motivation. Most priming is linked with emotion, the stronger the emotion, the stronger the connection between memory and the stimuli.&lt;ref name="AutoRef1" /&gt;

Priming also has an effect on drug users. In this case, it can be defined at, the reinstatement or increase in drug craving by a small dose of the drug or by stimuli associated with the drug. If a former drug user is in a place where they formerly did drugs, then they are tempted to do that same thing again even if they have been clean for years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Practical applications==
The control of motivation is only understood to a limited extent. There are many different approaches of ''motivation training'', but many of these are considered [[pseudoscientific]] by critics. To understand how to control motivation it is first necessary to understand why many people lack motivation.

===Implementations of natural theories===
Natural theories of motivation such as Theory Y argue that individuals are naturally willing to work and prefer jobs with high responsibility, creativity and ingenuity.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"/&gt; Holistically, the implementation in the workplace based on natural theories of motivation requires creating a comfortable and open work environment because it is through this climate that the individuals’ goals are most likely to be aligned with the organization's goals.
Based on the assumptions of natural theorists, individuals are motivated to work for an organization when they feel fulfillment from the work and organization. Therefore, hiring should focus on matching the goals of the individual with the goals of the organization rather than solely on the candidate's proficiency at completing a task, as rational theorists would argue. Logistically, there are several ways that firms can implement the assumptions of natural theories of motivation, including delegation of responsibilities, participation in management by employees, job enlargement, and membership within the firm.

====Delegation of responsibilities====
McGregor's Theory Y makes the assumption that the average person not only accepts, but also seeks out responsibility.&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt; Thus, as a firm gives individuals’ greater responsibilities, they will feel a greater sense of satisfaction and, subsequently, more commitment to the organization. Additionally, Malone argues that the delegation of responsibility encourages motivation because employees have creative control over their work and increases productivity as many people can work collaboratively to solve a problem rather than just one manager tackling it alone.&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malone|first=Thomas|title=Is 'Empowerment' Just a Fad? Control, Decision-Making, and Information Technology|journal=Sloan Management Review|year=1997|volume=23|issue=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Participative management====
Participative management styles involve consulting employees through the decision making process. Markowitz argues that this boosts employees’ morale and commitment to the organization, subsequently increasing productivity.&lt;ref name=Markowitz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markowitz|first=Linda|title=Employee Participation at the Workplace: Capitalist Control or Worker Freedom?|journal=Critical Sociology|year=1996|volume=22|issue=2|pages=89–103|doi=10.1177/089692059602200205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Denison provides empirical evidence demonstrating that employee participation is correlated with better organizational performance.&lt;ref name=Denison&gt;{{cite book|last=Denison|first=Daniel R.|title=Corporate Culture and Organizational Effectiveness|year=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that this stands in contract to Graham's rationalist view that kaizen, a participative management style used in Japan, does not engage employees’ minds in the decision making process.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Laura|title=Inside a Japanese Transplant: A Critical Perspective|journal=Work and Occupations|date=1 May 1993|volume=20|issue=2|pages=147–173|doi=10.1177/0730888493020002002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, however, only examines one specific and flawed participative management style that only allows limited input from employees.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; With a properly implemented process that actively engages employees, participative management will create a welcoming and productive environment.

====Job enlargement====
Job enlargement refers to increasing the responsibilities of a job by adding to the scope of the tasks. This provides more variety and prevents a job from getting boring. Additionally, this prevents the problem of alienation brought on by the rational theorists of Fordism.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"/&gt; In assembly lines, the employee feels disconnected from the final product because he or she only performs one task repeatedly. Job enlargement instead keeps employees engaged in the organization and creates a more welcoming environment. It stems on the assumption that employees enjoy doing work and, therefore, are more satisfied when they have a wider range of work to do.

====Firm membership====
As Mayo details, based on observations of the Hawthorn Western Electric Company, an additional facet of motivation stems from creating a culture of teams and membership within the firm.&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; For employees, a large part of job satisfaction is feeling as though one is a member of a larger team. For example, Mayo writes about a young girl worker who refused a transfer to a higher paid position in order to stay with a group that she felt a connection to.&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; This example demonstrates that workers are not necessarily rational and only working for higher monetary compensation; instead, the social aspects of a firm can provide incentives to work. It is important, therefore, to create an inclusive environment that welcomes each worker or employee as a member of that organization.

===Employee motivation===

“If one wishes to create a highly valid theory, which is also constructed with the purpose of enhanced usefulness in practice in mind, it would be best to look to motivation theories ... for an appropriate model” (Miner, 2003, p. 29).&lt;ref&gt;Miner, J.B. (2003). The rated importance, scientific validity, and practical usefulness of organizational behavior theories: a quantitative review. Acad. Manag.: Learn. Educ.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Job characteristics model====
{{main article|Job characteristics model}}
The Job characteristics Model (JCM), as designed by Hackman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://hackman.socialpsychology.org/ | title=Richard Hackman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oldham attempts to use job design to improve employee motivation.  They show that any job can be described in terms of five key job characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Hackman and G.R. Oldham. Work Redesign. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc, 1980; pp 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08956308.2005.11657344|title = Motivating Technical Professionals Today| journal=Research-Technology Management| volume=48| issue=6| pages=19–27|year = 2015|last1 = Katz|first1 = Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Skill variety'' – the degree to which the job requires the use of different skills and talents
# ''Task identity'' – the degree to which the job has contributed to a clearly identifiable larger project
# ''Task significance'' – the degree to which the job affects the lives or work of other people
# ''Autonomy'' – the degree to which the worker has independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job
# ''Task feedback'' – the degree to which the worker is provided with clear, specific, detailed, ''[[Action item|actionable]]'' information about the effectiveness of his or her [[job performance]]

The JCM links the core job dimensions listed above to critical psychological states which results in desired personal and work outcomes.  This forms the basis of this 'employee growth-need strength." The core dimensions listed above can be combined into a single predictive index, called the ''[[motivating potential score]]''.

=====Motivating potential score=====
{{See also|Work motivation|Job satisfaction}}

The [[motivating potential score]] (MPS) can be calculated, using the core dimensions discussed above, as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;{\text{MPS}}=&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\text{Autonomy}} \, \times \, {\text{Feedback}} \, \times \frac{\text{Skill Variety+Task Identity+Task Significance } }{\text{3} }  &lt;/math&gt;

Jobs high in motivating potential must be high on both Autonomy and Feedback, and also must be high on at least one of the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness.&lt;ref name=Steel2012&gt;Steel, Piers. Motivation: Theory and Applied. Boston, MA: Pearson Learning Solutions, 2012. Print. pp. 49&lt;/ref&gt; If a job has a high MPS, the job characteristics model predicts motivation, performance and job satisfaction will be positively affected and the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as absenteeism and turnover, will be reduced.&lt;ref name=Steel2012 /&gt;

====Employee recognition programs====
Employee recognition is not only about gifts and points. It's about changing the corporate culture in order to meet goals and initiatives and most importantly to connect employees to the company's core values and beliefs. Strategic employee recognition is seen as the most important program not only to improve employee retention and motivation but also to positively influence the financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo-insight.com/human-capital-career/talent-management/how-employee-recognition-programmes-improves-retention/ How Employee Recognition Programmes Improve Retention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116050945/http://www.cfo-insight.com/human-capital-career/talent-management/how-employee-recognition-programmes-improves-retention/ |date=2013-01-16 }} ''CFO Insight Magazine'', January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the traditional approach (gifts and points) and strategic recognition is the ability to serve as a serious business influencer that can advance a company's strategic objectives in a measurable way. "The vast majority of companies want to be innovative, coming up with new products, business models and better ways of doing things. However, innovation is not so easy to achieve. A CEO cannot just order it, and so it will be. You have to carefully manage an organization so that, over time, innovations will emerge."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/freekvermeulen/2011/05/30/five-mistaken-beliefs-business-leaders-have-about-innovation/ Five mistaken beliefs business leaders have about innovation] by Freek Vermeulen in ''Forbes'', May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education ===
Motivation is of particular interest to [[educational psychology|educational psychologists]] because of the crucial role it plays in student learning. However, the specific kind of motivation that is studied in the specialized setting of education differs qualitatively from the more general forms of motivation studied by psychologists in other fields.

Motivation in education can have several effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It can:
# Direct behavior toward particular goals
# Lead to increased effort and energy
# Increase initiation of, and persistence in, activities
# Enhance cognitive processing
# Determine what consequences are reinforcing
# Lead to improved performance.

Because students are not always internally motivated, they sometimes need ''situated motivation'', which is found in environmental conditions that the teacher creates.

If teachers decided to extrinsically reward productive student behaviors, they may find it difficult to extricate themselves from that path. Consequently, student dependency on [[extrinsic reward]]s represents one of the greatest detractors from their use in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08878730409555342|title = Classroom motivation strategies for prospective teachers| journal=The Teacher Educator| volume=39| issue=3| pages=212–230|year = 2004|last1 = Williams|first1 = Robert L.| last2=Stockdale| first2=Susan L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of new student orientation leaders at colleges and universities recognize that distinctive needs of students should be considered in regard to orientation information provided at the beginning of the higher education experience.  Research done by Whyte in 1986 raised the awareness of counselors and educators in this regard.  In 2007, the National Orientation Directors Association reprinted [[Cassandra B. Whyte]]'s research report allowing readers to ascertain improvements made in addressing specific needs of students over a quarter of a century later to help with academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra B | year = 2007 | title = An Additional Look at Orientation Programs Nationally- (reprint of 1986 article in same journal) | url = | journal = National Orientation Directors Association Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 71–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, motivation is conceptualized as either ''intrinsic'' or ''extrinsic''. Classically, these categories are regarded as distinct.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Today, these concepts are less likely to be used as distinct categories, but instead as two [[ideal type]]s that define a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0013164492052004025|title = The Academic Motivation Scale: A Measure of Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and Amotivation in Education| journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement| volume=52| issue=4| pages=1003–1017|year = 2016|last1 = Vallerand|first1 = Robert J.| last2=Pelletier| first2=Luc G.| last3=Blais| first3=Marc R.| last4=Briere| first4=Nathalie M.| last5=Senecal| first5=Caroline| last6=Vallieres| first6=Evelyne F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[#Intrinsic motivation|Intrinsic motivation]] occurs when people are internally motivated to do something because it either brings them pleasure, they think it is important, or they feel that what they are learning is significant.  It has been shown that intrinsic motivation for education drops from grades 3-9 though the exact cause cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.3.300|title = A new self-report scale of intrinsic versus extrinsic orientation in the classroom: Motivational and informational components| journal=Developmental Psychology| volume=17| issue=3| pages=300–312|year = 1981|last1 = Harter|first1 = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in younger students it has been shown that contextualizing material that would otherwise be presented in an abstract manner increases the intrinsic motivation of these students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.88.4.715|title = Intrinsic motivation and the process of learning: Beneficial effects of contextualization, personalization, and choice| journal=Journal of Educational Psychology| volume=88| issue=4| pages=715–730|year = 1996|last1 = Cordova|first1 = Diana I.| last2=Lepper| first2=Mark R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[#Extrinsic motivation|Extrinsic motivation]] comes into play when a student is compelled to do something or act a certain way because of factors external to him or her (like money or good grades).

Cassandra B. Whyte researched and reported about the importance of locus of control and academic achievement.  Students tending toward a more internal locus of control are more academically successful, thus encouraging curriculum and activity development with consideration of motivation theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/00256307.1978.12022132|title = Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen| journal=Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance| volume=10| issue=4| pages=198–200|year = 2018|last1 = Whyte|first1 = Cassandra Bolyard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lauridsen |editor-first=K. |editor2-last=Whyte |editor2-first=C.B. |year=1980 |title=An Integrated counseling and Learning Assistance Center. New Directions Sourcebook |publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic motivation orientation may also be tied with one's ability to detect and process errors. Fisher, Nanayakkara, and Marshall conducted neuroscience research on children's motivation orientation, neurological indicators of error monitoring (the process of detecting an error), and academic achievement. Their research suggests that students with high intrinsic motivation attribute performance to personal control and that their error-monitoring system is more strongly engaged by performance errors. They also found that motivation orientation and academic achievement were related to the strength in which their error-monitoring system was engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = K. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = M. | last3 = Nanayakkara | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Motivational orientation, error monitoring, and academic performance in middle childhood: A behavioral and electrophysiological investigation | url = | journal = Mind, Brain, and Education | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-228x.2008.01053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation has been found to be an important element in the concept of [[andragogy]] (what motivates the adult learner), and in treating Autism Spectrum Disorders, as in [[pivotal response treatment]]. 
Motivation has also been found critical in adolescents compliance to health suggestions, since "commitment requires belief in potentially negative and serious consequences of not acting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Adolescent Health Psychology |isbn=978-1-4614-6632-1 |page=376 |editor1=William T. O‘Donohue |editor2=Lorraine T. Benuto |editor3=Lauren Woodward Tolle |year=2013 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle and Moeyn have noted that traditional methods tended to use anxiety as negative motivation (e.g. use of bad grades by teachers) as a method of getting students to work. However, they have found that progressive approaches with focus on positive motivation over punishment has produced greater effectiveness with learning, since anxiety interferes with performance of complex tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 40195071|title = Measures of Academic Motivation: A Conceptual Review|journal = Research in Higher Education|volume = 8|issue = 1|pages = 1–23|last1 = Moen|first1 = Ross|last2 = Doyle|first2 = Kenneth O.|year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symer et al. attempted to better define those in medical training programs who may have a ”surgical personality”.  They evaluated a group of eight hundred and one first-year surgical interns to compare motivational traits amongst those who did and did not complete surgical training.  There was no difference noted between the 80.5% who completed training when comparing their responses to the 19.5% who did not complete training using the validated Behavior Inhibitory System/Behavior Approach System.  They concluded based on this that resident physician motivation is not associated with completion of a surgical training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.02.007| pmid=29510202|title = The Surgical Personality: Does Surgery Resident Motivation Predict Attrition?| journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons| volume=226| issue=5| pages=777–783|year = 2018|last1 = Symer|first1 = Matthew M.| last2=Abelson| first2=Jonathan S.| last3=Yeo| first3=Heather L.| last4=Sosa| first4=Julie A.| last5=Rosenthal| first5=M. Zachary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of teaching style on student intrinsic motivation===

It may appear that the reason some students are more engaged and perform better in class activities relative to other students is because some are more motivated than others. However, current research suggests that motivation is not concrete or quantifiable; it is “dynamic, context sensitive, and changeable.” &lt;ref name="AutoRef2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclellan|title=Academic achievement:The role of praise in motivating students|journal=Active Learning in Higher Education|date=2005|doi=10.1177/146978740505775|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, students have the flexibility to, intrinsically, motivate themselves to engage in an activity or learn something new even if they were not intrinsically motivated in the first place &lt;ref name="AutoRef13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sansone|last2=Morgan|title=Intrinsic motivation and education: Competence in context|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=1992|volume=16|issue=3|pages=249–270|doi=10.1007/bf00991654}}&lt;/ref&gt; . While having this type of flexibility is important, research reveals that a teacher's teaching style and the school environment also play a factor in student motivation.&lt;ref name="AutoRef4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|last2=Shahar|title=What makes a motivating teacher? Teacher's motivation and beliefs as predictors of their autonomy-supportive style|journal=School Psychology International|date=2015|doi=10.1177/0143034315609969|volume=36|issue=6|pages=575–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRef2" /&gt;; &lt;ref name="AutoRef5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reeve|title=Why teachers adopt a controlling motivating style toward students and how they can become more autonomy supportive|journal=Educational Psychologist|date=2009|volume=44|issue=3|pages=159–175|doi=10.1080/00461520903028990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Sansone and Morgan, when students are already motivated to engage in an activity for their own personal pleasure and then a teacher provides the student with feedback, the type of feedback given can change the way that student views the activity and can even undermine their intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="AutoRef13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|last2=Koestner|last3=Ryan|title=Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=2001|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.3102/00346543071001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclellan also looked at the relationship between tutors and students and in particular, and the type of feedback the tutor would give to the student. Maclellan's results showed that praise or criticism directed towards the student generated a feeling of “fixed [[intelligence]]” while praise and criticism directed towards the effort and strategy used by the student generated a feeling of “[[Malleability of intelligence|malleable intelligence]]” &lt;ref name="AutoRef2" /&gt; .  In other words, feedback concerning effort and strategy leaves students knowing that there is room for growth. This is important because when students believe their intelligence is “fixed”, their mindset can prevent skill development because students will believe that they only have a “certain amount” of understanding on a particular subject matter and might not even try.Therefore, it's crucial that a teacher is aware of how the feedback they give to their students can both positively and negatively impact the student's engagement and motivation &lt;ref name="AutoRef2" /&gt;  &lt;ref name="AutoRef4" /&gt;.  

In a correlational study, Katz and Shahar used a series of questionnaires and Likert-style scales and gave them to 100 teachers to see what makes a motivating teacher. Their results indicate that teachers who are intrinsically motivated to teach and believe that students should be taught in an autonomous style are the types of teachers that promote intrinsic motivation in the classroom.&lt;ref name="AutoRef4" /&gt; Deci, Sheinman, and Nezlek also found that when teachers adapted to an autonomous teaching style, students were positively affected and became more intrinsically motivated to achieve in the classroom.  However, while the students were quick to adapt to the new teaching style the impact was short-lived.&lt;ref name="AutoRef6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|last2=Sheinman|last3=Nezlek|title=Characteristics of the rewardee and intrinsic motivation of the rewardee|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, teachers are limited in the way they teach because they’ll feel a pressure to act, teach, and provide feedback in a certain way from the school district, administration, and guardians.&lt;ref name="AutoRef6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRef5" /&gt; Furthermore, even if students do have a teacher that promotes an autonomous teaching style, their overall school environment is also a factor because it can be extrinsically motivating. Examples of this would be posters around school promoting pizza parties for highest grade point average or longer recess times for the classroom that brings more canned food donations. 

In conclusion, it is not a matter whether a student is motivated, unmotivated, or more motivated than other students- it's a matter of understanding what motivates students before providing a certain type of feedback. Furthermore, it is also important to note that despite the classroom environment and the teacher's teaching style, the overall school environment plays a role in students’ intrinsic motivation. 

====Indigenous education and learning====
For many indigenous students (such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] children), motivation may be derived from social organization; an important factor educators should account for in addition to variations in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Instructional Conversations in Native American Classrooms (1994). Center for Applied Linguistics: Online Digests (5).&lt;/ref&gt; While poor academic performance among Native American students is often attributed to low levels of motivation, [[wikt:top-down|Top-down]] classroom organization is often found to be ineffective for children of many cultures who depend on a sense of community, purpose, and competence in order to engage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McInerney | first1 = Dennis M. | last2 = Gayton Swisher | first2 = Karen | year = 1995 | title = Exploring Navajo Motivation in School Settings | url = | journal = Journal of American Indian Education | volume = 34 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontally structured, community-based learning strategies often provide a more structurally supportive environment for motivating [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous children]], who tend to be driven by "social/affective emphasis, harmony, holistic perspectives, expressive creativity, and [[nonverbal communication]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pewewardy | first1 = Cornel | year = 2002 | title = Learning Styles of American Indian/Alaska Native Students: A Review of the Literature and Implications for Practice | url = | journal = Journal of American Indian Education | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This drive is also traceable to a cultural tradition of community-wide expectations of participation in the activities and goals of the greater group, rather than individualized aspirations of success or triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Pelletier (1969). Childhood in an Indian Village. Institute for Indian Studies. Neewin Publishing, Toronto etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in some indigenous communities, young children can often portray a sense of community-based motivation through their parent-like interactions with siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard | first1 = A. E. | year = 2004 | title = Cultures of teaching in childhood: formal schooling and Maya sibling teaching at home | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 517–535 | doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2004.09.005| citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.6959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is commonplace for children to [[Child work in indigenous American cultures|assist and demonstrate]] for their younger counterparts without being prompted by authority figures.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Maynard, A. E. 2004"/&gt; (ref not defined)--&gt; [[Observation]] techniques and [[Child Integration|integration]] methods are demonstrated in such examples as [[weaving]] in Chiapas, Mexico, where it is commonplace for children to learn from "a more skilled other" within the community.&lt;ref name="Greenfield P. M"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenfield | first1 = P. M. | last2 = Maynard | first2 = A. E. | last3 = Childs | first3 = C. P. | year = 2000 | title = History, culture, learning, and development | url = | journal = Cross-cultural Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 351–374 | doi=10.1177/106939710003400404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's real responsibility within the [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] community can be seen in, for example, weaving apprenticeships; often, when the "more skilled other" is tasked with multiple obligations, an older child will step in and guide the learner.&lt;ref name="Greenfield P. M"/&gt; Sibling guidance is supported from early youth, where [[learning through play]] encourages horizontally structured environments through alternative educational models such as "Intent Community Participation."&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara (2011). Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town. Cambridge: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that formal Westernized schooling can actually reshape the traditionally collaborative nature of social life in indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chavajay | first1 = Pablo | year = 2002 | title = Schooling and Traditional Collaborative Social Organization of Problem Solving by Mayan Mothers and Children | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 55–66| doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55 | pmid=11806702}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is supported cross-culturally, with variations in motivation and learning often reported higher between indigenous groups and their national Westernized counterparts than between indigenous groups across international continental divides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lillemyr |first1=Ole Fredrik |last2=Søbstad |first2=Frode |last3=Marder |first3=Kurt |last4=Flowerday |first4=Terri |date=June 2010 |title=Indigenous and non-Indigenous primary school students' attitudes on play, humour, learning and self-concept: a comparative perspective |journal=European Early Childhood Education Research Journal |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=243–267 |doi=10.1080/13502931003784396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in some Indigenous communities in the Americas, motivation is a driving force for learning. Children are incorporated and welcomed to participate in daily activities and thus feel motivated to participate due to them seeking a sense of belonging in their families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Paradise | first2 = R. | last3 = Mejia Arauz | first3 = R. | last4 = Correa-Chavez | first4 = M. | last5 = Angelillo | first5 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Firsthand learning through intent participation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 175–203 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118 | pmid=12499516| hdl = 10400.12/5953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's participation is encouraged and their learning is supported by their community and family, furthering their motivation. Children are also trusted to be active contributors. Their active participation allows them to learn and gain skills that are valuable and useful in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Learning without lessons: Opportunities to expand knowledge | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/MESO/article/view/54548| journal = Infancia y Aprendizaje / Journal for the Study of Education and Development | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 233–252 | doi = 10.1174/021037012800217970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As children transition from early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of [[Quechua people]] and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition in which they become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads to an increase in their eagerness to participate and belong. As children go through this transition, they often develop a sense of identity within their family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ames | first1 = P | year = 2013 | title = Learning to be responsible: Young children transitions outside of school | url = | journal = Learning, Culture and Social Interaction | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 143–154 | doi = 10.1016/j.lcsi.2013.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from childhood to adolescence can be seen in the amount of work children partake in as this changes over time. For example, Yucatec [[Mayan children]]'s play time decreases from childhood to adolescence and as the child gets older, is replaced for time spent working. In childhood the work is initiated by others whereas in adolescence it is self-initiated. The shift in initiation and the change in time spent working versus playing shows the children's motivation to participate in order to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaskins | first1 = S | year = 2000 | title = Children's daily activities in a mayan village: A culturally grounded description | url = | journal = Cross-Cultural Research: The Journal of Comparative Social Science | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 375–389 | doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transition between childhood and adolescence increases motivation because children gain social responsibility within their families. In some Mexican communities of Indigenous-heritage, the contributions that children make within their community is essential to being social beings, establishes their developing roles, and also helps with developing their relationship with their family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Correa-Chávez | first1 = M. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = A. L. D. | last3 = Pérez | first3 = M. M. | year = 2011 | title = Cultural patterns in children's learning through keen observation and participation in their communities | journal = Adv Child Dev Behav | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 209–241 | doi = 10.1016/b978-0-12-386491-8.00006-2 | pmid=21887963| series = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | isbn = 9780123864918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As children gain more roles and responsibilities within their families, their eagerness to participate also increases. For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn to work in the fields and family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family. Many San Pedro women learned to weave by watching their mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers. Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mejía-Arauz | first1 = R. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Dexter | first3 = A. | last4 = Najafi | first4 = B. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural Variation in Children's Social Organization | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 3| pages = 1001–1014 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01046.x | pmid = 17517018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's motivation to learn is not solely influenced on their desire to belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed. Children from [[Navajo]] communities were shown to have higher levels of social concern than Anglo American children in their schools. By having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for not only their learning but also their peers', which serves as an example of their instilled sense of responsibility for their community. They wish to succeed as a united group rather than just themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = J. | last2 = Mcinerney | first2 = D. | last3 = Craven | first3 = R. | last4 = Yeung | first4 = A. | last5 = King | first5 = R. | year = 2013 | title = Socially Oriented Motivational Goals and Academic Achievement: Similarities Between Native and Anglo Americans | url = | journal = The Journal of Educational Research | volume = 107 | issue = 2| pages = 123–137 | doi = 10.1080/00220671.2013.788988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be knowledgeable contributors, children must be aware of their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity that they are doing within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paradise | first1 = R. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In. | url = | journal = Ethos | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 102–138 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-determination in education====
Self-determination is the ability to make choices and exercise a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, &amp; Nix, 2003; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of "learned helplessness". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try. Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.

====Physical activity in education====
Physical activity is body movement that works your muscles and requires more energy than resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease [[anxiety]] and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.&lt;ref&gt;American Intercontinental University.

Web. 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
{{main article|Work motivation|Organizational behavior#Motivation}}
At lower levels of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], such as physiological needs, money is a motivator, however it tends to have a motivating effect on staff that lasts only for a short period (in accordance with [[Frederick Herzberg|Herzberg]]'s two-factor model of motivation). At higher levels of the hierarchy, praise, respect, recognition, [[empowerment]] and a sense of belonging are far more powerful motivators than money, as both [[Abraham Maslow]]'s theory of motivation and [[Douglas McGregor (business theorist)|Douglas McGregor]]'s [[theory X and theory Y]] (pertaining to the theory of leadership) demonstrate.

According to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs.&lt;ref&gt;Tom P (2004). Managing IT According To A Hierarchy Of Needs. N/A. http://archive.webpronews.com/it/itmanagement/wpn-18-20040302ManagingITAccordingtoaHierarchyofNeeds.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower level needs such as Physiological and Safety needs will have to be satisfied before higher level needs are to be addressed. We can relate Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory with employee motivation. For example, if a manager is trying to motivate his employees by satisfying their needs; according to Maslow, he should try to satisfy the lower level needs before he tries to satisfy the upper level needs or the employees will not be motivated. Also he has to remember that not everyone will be satisfied by the same needs. A good manager will try to figure out which levels of needs are active for a certain individual or employee.

Maslow has money at the lowest level of the hierarchy and shows other needs are better motivators to staff. McGregor places money in his Theory X category and feels it is a poor motivator. Praise and recognition are placed in the Theory Y category and are considered stronger motivators than money.
* Motivated employees always look for better ways to do a job.
* Motivated employees are more quality oriented.
* Motivated workers are more productive.

The average workplace is about midway between the extremes of high threat and high opportunity. Motivation by threat is a dead-end strategy, and naturally staff are more attracted to the opportunity side of the motivation curve than the threat side. Motivation is a powerful tool in the work environment that can lead to employees working at their most efficient levels of production.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, L. (1983) Nice Guys Finish Last: Management Myths and Reality. Boulder, Colorado: Horizon Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Steinmetz also discusses three common character types of subordinates: ascendant, indifferent, and ambivalent who all react and interact uniquely, and must be treated, managed, and motivated accordingly. An effective leader must understand how to manage all characters, and more importantly the manager must utilize avenues that allow room for employees to work, grow, and find answers independently.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, L.L. (1983) Nice Guys Finish Last: Management Myths and Reality. Boulder, Colorado: Horizon Publications Inc. (pp. 43–44)&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptions of Maslow and Herzberg were challenged by a classic study&lt;ref&gt;Goldthorpe, J.H., Lockwood, D., Bechhofer, F. and Platt, J. (1968) The Affluent Worker: Attitudes and Behaviour Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; at Vauxhall Motors' UK manufacturing plant. This introduced the concept of orientation to work and distinguished three main orientations: instrumental (where work is a means to an end), bureaucratic (where work is a source of status, security and immediate reward) and solidaristic (which prioritizes group loyalty).

Other theories which expanded and extended those of Maslow and Herzberg included [[Kurt Lewin]]'s [[force-field analysis]], [[Edwin A. Locke]]'s [[goal-setting theory]] and [[Victor Vroom]]'s [[expectancy theory]]. These tend to stress cultural differences and the fact that individuals tend to be motivated by different factors at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Weightman, J. (2008) The Employee Motivation Audit: Cambridge Strategy Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the system of [[scientific management]] developed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], a worker's motivation is solely determined by pay, and therefore management need not consider psychological or social aspects of work. In essence, scientific management bases human motivation wholly on [[extrinsic reward]]s and discards the idea of [[intrinsic reward]]s.

In contrast, [[David McClelland]] believed that workers could not be motivated by the mere need for [[money]]—in fact, [[#Extrinsic motivation|extrinsic motivation]] (e.g., money) could extinguish [[#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] such as achievement motivation, though money could be used as an indicator of success for various motives, e.g., keeping score. In keeping with this view, his consulting firm, McBer &amp; Company, had as its first motto "To make everyone productive, happy, and free." For McClelland, satisfaction lay in aligning a person's life with their fundamental motivations.

[[Elton Mayo]] found that the social contacts a worker has at the workplace are very important and that boredom and repetitiveness of tasks lead to reduced motivation. Mayo believed that workers could be motivated by acknowledging their social needs and making them feel important. As a result, employees were given freedom to make decisions on the job and greater attention was paid to informal work groups.

Mayo named the model the [[Hawthorne effect]]. His model has been judged as placing undue reliance on social contacts within work situations for motivating employees.&lt;ref&gt;Human Resources Management, HT Graham and R Bennett M+E Handbooks(1993) {{ISBN|0-7121-0844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Ouchi]] introduced [[Theory Z]], a hybrid management approach consisting of both Japanese and American philosophies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Tim, and Scott B. Droege. "Theory Z." Encyclopedia of Management. Ed. Marilyn M. Helms. 5th ed. Detroit: Gale, 2006. 914-916. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 5 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its Japanese segment is much like the clan culture where organizations focus on a standardized structure with heavy emphasis on socialization of its members. All underlying goals are consistent across the organization. Its American segment retains formality and authority amongst members and the organization. Ultimately, Theory Z promotes common structure and commitment to the organization, as well as constant improvement of work efficacy.

In ''Essentials of Organizational Behavior'', Robbins and Judge examine recognition programs as motivators, and identify five principles that contribute to the success of an employee [[incentive program]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Robbins |first1=Stephen P. |last2=Judge |first2=Timothy A. |year=2007 |title=Essentials of Organizational Behavior |edition=9 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Upper Saddle River, NJ]] |url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_robbins_eob_9/64/16396/4197506.cw/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614205602/http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_robbins_eob_9/64/16396/4197506.cw/index.html |archivedate=2009-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recognition of employees' individual differences, and clear identification of behavior deemed worthy of recognition
* Allowing employees to participate
* Linking rewards to performance
* Rewarding of nominators
* Visibility of the recognition process
Modern organizations adopt non-monetary employee motivation methods rather than tying it with tangible rewards. 
* Provide a positive work environment
* Encourage team contribution and rewards
* Feedback 
* Give challenging roles 
* Empowering employees with training and independent thinking
This method makes employees feel they're a part of the organization and their reward is seeing it grow through their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motivationmatters.tips/2016/08/31/team-productivity-employee-morale/|title=Team Productivity: 15 Top Tips to Boost Employee Morale|last=Writer|first=Staff|date=2016-08-31|website=Motivation Matters|access-date=2016-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129025611/http://motivationmatters.tips/2016/08/31/team-productivity-employee-morale/|archive-date=2016-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
Motivational models are central to [[game design]], because without motivation, a player will not be interested in progressing further within a [[game]].&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon. April 2011. ''Game On: Energize Your Business with Social Games.'' {{ISBN|978-0-470-93626-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models for gameplay motivations have been proposed, including [[Bartle Test|Richard Bartle's]]. [[Jon Radoff]] has proposed a four-quadrant model of gameplay motivation that includes cooperation, competition, immersion and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon. "Game Player Motivations." May 2011. [http://radoff.com/blog/2011/05/19/game-player-motivations/ radoff.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521045620/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/05/19/game-player-motivations/ |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivational structure of games is central to the [[gamification]] trend, which seeks to apply game-based motivation to business applications.&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37451547/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/|title=FarmVille invades the real world|first=Helen|last=Popkin|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, game designers must know the needs and desires of their customers for their companies to flourish.

There have been various studies on the connection between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies by the same people were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than [[#Extrinsic motivation|extrinsic motivation]] and more [[#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] than the non-addicted players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 17536482|year = 2007|last1 = Wan|first1 = C. S.|title = The motivations of adolescents who are addicted to online games: A cognitive perspective|journal = Adolescence|volume = 42|issue = 165|pages = 179–97|last2 = Chiou|first2 = W. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R.

===Racism===
In 2016 Richardson represented [[Coronation Street]] actor Marc Anwar&lt;ref name="“independent06"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marc Anwar sacked from Coronation Street over ‘racially offensive tweets’ |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/marc-anwar-coronation-street-sacked-racially-offensive-tweets-twitter-a7328786.html |accessdate=11 November 2017 |date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became the centre of a racism row after posting a controversial comment about Indians on [[Twitter]], which resulted in his sacking from the ITV soap.&lt;ref name="“standard.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Coronation Street star Marc Anwar SACKED from soap after astonishing racist Twitter attack |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-actor-marc-anwar-8909333.amp |accessdate=11 November 2017 |date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joe Orton's retrial===
As a judge, Richardson presided over [[Joe Orton]]'s retrial in 2012.&lt;ref name="“camdennewjournal.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Camden Journal: Orton and Halliwell back in the dock |url=http://archive.camdennewjournal.com/orton-and-halliwell-back-dock5 |accessdate=22 October 2017 |date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orton was an English writer who in 1962 was sentenced to six months imprisonment for historic sexual offences and fined for stealing and damaging Islington Public Library books.&lt;ref name="“islingtongazette.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Orton retrial |url=http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/heritage/tragic-islington-playwright-joe-orton-escapes-jail-50-years-later-1-1194984 |accessdate=22 October 2017 |date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution insisted on retrial fifty years after he served his conviction.&lt;ref name="“islingtontribune.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simulated retrial sees playwright Joe Orton escape jail |url=https://archive.islingtontribune.com/news/2012/feb/simulated-retrial-sees-playwright-joe-orton-escape-jail |accessdate=22 October 2017 |date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case made national headlines with newspapers arguing as to whether it was right to put Orton on trial. Orton later suggested that the lengthy sentence was given because “he was a queer.”&lt;ref name="“dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Why I blame myself for the murder of Sixties playwright Joe Orton, by theatre critic and friend Michael Thornton |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167197/Why-I-blame-murder-Sixties-playwright-Joe-Orton-theatre-critic-friend-Michael-Thornton.html |accessdate=22 October 2017 |date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[software development]], '''obfuscation''' is the deliberate act of creating [[source code|source]] or [[machine code]] that is difficult for humans to understand. Like [[obfuscation]] in [[natural language]], it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements.
Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose ([[security through obscurity]]) or its logic or implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, deter [[reverse engineering]], or even as a [[puzzle]] or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code. This can be done manually or by using an automated tool, the latter being the preferred technique in industry.

==Overview==
The architecture and characteristics of some languages may make them easier to obfuscate than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binstock |first=Andrew |url=http://www.devx.com/microsoftISV/Article/11351 |title=Obfuscation: Cloaking your Code from Prying Eyes |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420165109/http://www.devx.com/microsoftISV/Article/11351 |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atwood |first=Jeff |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000291.html |title=Jeff Atwood, May 15, 2005 |publisher=Codinghorror.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C (programming language)|C]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenter.demon.nl/obfuscate.html |title=Obfuscation |publisher=Kenter.demon.nl |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C++]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=38102 |title=C++ Tutorials - Obfuscated Code - A Simple Introduction |publisher=DreamInCode.net |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rcorcs/posts/obfuscatedcode |title=C Tutorials - Obfuscated Code in C |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Perl]] [[programming language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 2013-11-25 18:22 GMT |url=http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=291267 |title=Pe(a)rls in line noise |publisher=Perlmonks.org |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are some examples of languages easy to obfuscate.

==Recreational obfuscation==

Writing and reading obfuscated source code can be a [[brain teaser]]. A number of programming contests reward the most creatively obfuscated code, such as the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] and the [[Obfuscated Perl Contest]].

Types of obfuscations include simple keyword substitution, use or non-use of whitespace to create artistic effects, and self-generating or heavily compressed programs.

According to [[Nick Montfort]], techniques may include: 
# naming obfuscation, which includes naming variables in a meaningless or deceptive way; 
# data/code/comment confusion, which includes making some actual code look like comments or confusing syntax with data; 
# double coding, which can be displaying code in poetry form or interesting shapes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Montfort |first=Nick |url=http://obfuscationsymposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Montfort__Obfuscated_Code.pdf |title=Obfuscated code |accessdate=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short obfuscated [[Perl]] programs may be used in [[Signature block|signatures]] of Perl programmers.  These are JAPHs ("[[Just another Perl hacker]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rochester.pm.org/talks/japh_discussion.txt |title=JAPH - Just Another Perl Hacker |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=pm.org |publisher=Perl Mongers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516074850/http://rochester.pm.org/talks/japh_discussion.txt |archive-date=16 May 2013 |access-date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of obfuscation==
There are several advantages of automated code obfuscation that have made it popular and widely useful across many platforms. On some platforms (such as Java.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5765412-decompiling-java|title="Decompiling Java" by Godfrey Nolan|publisher=Apress;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14975259-decompiling-android|title="Decompiling Android" by Godfrey Nolan|publisher=Apress;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and .NET) a [[decompiler]] can reverse-engineer source code from an executable or library. 
A main advantage of automated code obfuscation is that it helps protect the trade secrets (intellectual property) contained within software by making reverse-engineering a program difficult and economically unfeasible. Other advantages might include helping to protect licensing mechanisms and unauthorized access, and shrinking the size of the executable. Decompilation is sometimes called a man-at-the-end attack, based on the traditional cryptographic attack known as "[[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]]".

==Disadvantages of obfuscation==
While obfuscation can make reading, writing, and reverse-engineering a program difficult and time-consuming, it will not necessarily make it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ias.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html |title="Can We Obfuscate Programs?" by Boaz Barak |publisher=Math.ias.edu |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anti-virus software, such as [[AVG AntiVirus]],{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} will also alert their users when they land on a site with code that is manually obfuscated, as one of the purposes of obfuscation can be to hide malicious code. However, some developers may employ code obfuscation for the purpose of reducing file size or increasing security. The average user may not expect their antivirus software to provide alerts about an otherwise harmless piece of code, especially from trusted corporations, so such a feature may actually deter users from using legitimate software.

==Obfuscating software==
A variety of tools exist to perform or assist with code obfuscation.
These include experimental research tools created by academics, hobbyist tools,
commercial products written by professionals, and [[open-source software]].
There also exist deobfuscation tools that attempt to perform the reverse
transformation.

Although the majority of commercial obfuscation solutions work by transforming
either program source
code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/JavaScript/Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: JavaScript: Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-08-03 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/PHP/Development_Tools/Obfuscation_and_Encryption/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: PHP: Development Tools: Obfuscation and Encryption |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or platform-independent bytecode as used by
Java&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Java/Development_Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: Java: Development Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
.NET,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Component_Frameworks/NET/Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Component Frameworks: .NET: Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2007-01-02 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are also some that work directly on compiled binaries.

==Obfuscation and copyleft licenses==

There has been debate on whether it is illegal to skirt [[copyleft]] software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The issue is addressed in the [[GNU General Public License]] by defining source code as the "preferred" version of the source code be made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/431651/ |title=Reasoning behind the "preferred form of the work for making modifications to it" language in the GPL |publisher=Lwn.net |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNU website states "Obfuscated 'source code' is not real source code and does not count as source code." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=What is free software? |publisher=gnu.net |accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Political naturalism''' is a minor [[political ideology]] and [[legal system]] which believes that there is a [[natural law]], just and obvious to all, that crosses ideologies, faiths and personal thinking, that naturally guaranties justice. It is inspired by [[sociological naturalism]], and [[methodological naturalism|scientific naturalism]]'s belief that the precision of [[natural sciences]] can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law.

It may be seen as a natural law-based version of [[Liberal legalism|legalism]]/[[constitutionalism]] (especially [[Constitutionalism#Prescriptive use|of prescriptive constitutionalism]], in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many [[constitutional monarchies]] (as in that system they too believe in [[rule of the law]] and in certain things who are naturally correct (like [[monarchy]], monarchic [[institutions]] and [[traditions]].

The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like [[John Locke]]'s and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s, and even in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence|United States Declaration of Independence]], 1776, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic]] [[Germany|German]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.&lt;ref&gt;He stated that "laws are not made ''but found''", implying the existence of already existing natural laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main modern thinker is [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar and creator of the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri|Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ''«in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles,'' '''the judge shall have recourse to natural law''' ''and the rules of equity.»''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] and modern [[Qatar]]) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the [[Syrian]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[civil codes]] and the [[Kuwait]]i [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

{{Pulitzer}}

The '''[[Pulitzer Prize]] for Criticism''' has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism'.  Recipients of the award are chosen by an independent board and officially administered by [[Columbia University]].  The Pulitzer Committee issues an official citation explaining the reasons for the award.

{{essay|date=March 2012}}

A person’s '''second language''' or '''L2''' is a language that is not the [[native language]]/[[first language]]/L1 of the speaker, but is learned by the speaker after his/her native language (usually a [[foreign language]], see below). Additionally, a person’s second language can be explained as the second language in the country the speaker lives in and they may be both used in daily life. For example, [[Languages of Canada|Canada]] has two official languages (English and French) and some citizens speak and use both of them.&lt;br&gt;
A person’s dominant language, which is the language the speaker uses most or is most comfortable with, is not necessarily to be his/her first language. The second language can also be the dominant one. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as "the first language learned in childhood and still spoken", recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as [[language attrition]]. This can happen when young children move, with or without their family (because of [[immigration]] or [[international adoption]]), to a new language environment.&lt;br&gt;

==Second-language acquisition==
{{main|Second-language acquisition}}
{{Further|Theories of second-language acquisition}}
[[File:Spanish orthography.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Blackboard]] used in [[Class (education)|class]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] shows [[student]]s' efforts at placing the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] and [[acute accent]] [[diacritic]]s used in the [[Spanish orthography]].]]
The distinction between '''acquiring''' and '''learning''' was made by [[Stephen Krashen]] (1982) as part of his [[Monitor Theory]]. According to Krashen, the ''acquisition'' of a language is a '''natural''' process; whereas ''learning'' a language is a '''conscious''' one. In the former, the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations. In the latter, error correction is present, as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language. Not all educators in second language agree to this distinction; however, the study of how a second language is ''learned/acquired'' is referred to as ''second-language acquisition'' (SLA).

Research in SLA "...focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language... [and] a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults." (Spada &amp; Lightbown, p.&amp;nbsp;115).

SLA has been influenced by both linguistic and [[psychology|psychological]] theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a ''device'' or ''module'' of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, hypothesize that [[Cognition#Cognition as social process|cognitive mechanisms]], responsible for much of human learning, process language.

Other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings can be transferred to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes L2 learners’ language as a rule-governed, dynamic system) (Mitchell, Myles, 2004).  
  
These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the [[grammar-translation method]], the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the [[audio-lingual method]] (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], [[community language learning]], the [[Total Physical Response method]], and the [[communicative approach]] (highly influenced by Krashen’s theories) (Doggett, 1994). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.

===Effect of age===
The defining difference between a first language (L1) and a second language (L2) is the age the person learned the language. For example, [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Eric Lenneberg]] used ''second language'' to mean [[language acquisition|a language consciously acquired]] or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beerten|first=Roeland |author2=Billiet, Jaak |author3=Bart Maddens|title=National Identity and Attitude Toward Foreigners in a Multinational State: A Replication|journal=International Society of Political Psychology|year=2003|volume=24|series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Brian|title=Defining Culture in a Multicultural Environment: An Ethnography of Heritage High School|journal=American Journal of Education|date=Aug 1995|volume=103|series=4|pages=339–376|doi=10.1086/444107|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarcella|first=Robin |author2=Krashen, Stephen D. |author3=Michael A. Long |title=Age, Rate and Eventual Attainment in Second Language Acquisition|journal=TESOL Quarterly|date=Dec 1979|volume=13|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.2307/3586451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In acquiring an L2, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cut-off point for [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]] to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, L2 learners could get ''near-native-like-ness'' but their language would, while consisting of few actual errors, have enough errors to set them apart from the L1 group. The inability of some subjects to achieve native-like proficiency must be seen in relation to the ''age of onset'' (AO). Later, Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson (2003) modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness, but that there is no cut-off point in particular.&lt;br&gt;

As we are learning more and more about the brain, there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty, that is the time that accents ''start''. Before a child goes through puberty, the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication. Whereas after puberty, the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions, or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth.

As far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in SLA is concerned, Krashen, Long, and Scarcella, say that people who encounter foreign language in early age, begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult. However, when it comes to the relationship between age and rate [[Second-language acquisition|SLA]], “Adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children (where time and exposure are held constant)” ([[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]], Long, Scarcella 573). Also, “older children acquire faster than younger children do (again, in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant)” (573). In other words, adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education.

Gauthier and Genesee (2011) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language, and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gauthier |first1=Karine |last2=Genesee |first2=Fred |title=Language Development in Internationally Adopted Children: A Special Case of Early Second Language Learning |journal=Child Development |date=March 2011 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=887-901 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for the fluency, it is better to do foreign language education at an early age, but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “weak identification” (Billiet, Maddens and Beerten 241). Such issue leads to a "double sense of national belonging," that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to Brian A. Jacob, multicultural education affects students' "relations, attitudes, and behaviors" (Jacob 364). And as children learn more and more foreign languages, children start to adapt, and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made” (Pratt 35). Due to such factors, learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one’s perspective of his or her native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency===
====Speed====
Acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many. Despite persistent efforts, most learners of a second language will never become fully ''native-like'' in it, although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/2/category/accent/1.html|title=Good Accents|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of [[vocabulary]] and a few [[Grammar|grammatical]] structures, and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill. Moreover, if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger, they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Newport |first2=Elissa |title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |date=January 1989 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=60-99 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====Correction====
In the first language, children do not respond to systematic correction. Furthermore, children who have limited input still acquire the first language, which is a significant difference between input and output. Children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules. Error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language. Instruction may affect the rate of learning, but the stages remain the same. Adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not. &lt;br&gt;

In the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought. Throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students’ errors. In the 1950s and 60s the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs. Little thought went to students’ feelings or self-esteem in regards to this constant correction (Russell, 2009).

In the 1970s Dulay and Burt’s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined, inalterable order, and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this (Russell, 2009).

In this same decade Terrell (1977) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students (Russell, 2009). He contested that the affective side of students and their self-esteem were equally important to the teaching process (Russell, 2009).

A few years later in the 1980s, the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete. Researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students’ learning it was hindering them (Russell, 2009). The main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them. Stephen Krashen was a big proponent in this hands-off approach to error correction (Russell, 2009).

The 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the SLA process. At this time, more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students. In 1998, Lyster concluded that “recasts” (when the teacher repeats a student’s incorrect utterance with the correct version) are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction (Russell, 2009). His studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors (Russell, 2009). Mackey, Gas and McDonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student’s active participation in the corrective processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Victoria|title=Corrective feedback, over a decade of research since Lyster and Ranta (1997): Where do we stand today?|journal=Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–31|url=https://varussellblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/russell_eflt_2009.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth of knowledge====
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], children will bridge the gap between input and output by their innate grammar because the input (utterances they hear) is so poor but all children end up having complete knowledge of grammar. Chomsky calls it the [[Poverty of the stimulus|Poverty of Stimulus]]. And second language learners can do this by applying the rules they learn to the sentence-construction, for example. So learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received, so that people can make correct utterances (phrases, sentences, questions, etc) that they have never learned or heard before.&lt;br&gt;

====Emotionality====
[[Bilingualism]] has been an advantage to today's world and being bilingual gives the opportunity to understand and communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, a study done by Optiz and Degner in 2012 shows that sequential bilinguals (i.e. learn their L2 after L1) often relate themselves to the emotions more when they perceive these emotions by their first language/native language/L1, but feel less emotional when by their second language even though they know the meaning of words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=Bertram |last2=Degner |first2=Juliane |title=Emotionality in a second language: It's a matter of time |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=July 2012 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1961-1967 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212001844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional distinction between L1 and L2 indicates that the "effective valence" of words is processed less immediate in L2 because of the delayed vocabulary/lexical access to these two languages.&lt;br&gt;

====Success====
Success in language learning can be measured in two ways: likelihood and quality. First language learners ''will'' be successful in both measurements. It is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions, they will be fully successful. For second language learners, success is not guaranteed. For one, learners may become fossilized or ''stuck'' as it were with ungrammatical items. ([[Fossilization (linguistics)|Fossilization]] occurs when language errors become a permanent feature. See Canale &amp; Swain (1980), Johnson (1992), Selinker (1972), and Selinker and Lamendella (1978).) The difference between learners may be significant. As noted elsewhere, L2 learners rarely achieve complete ''native-like'' control of the second language. &lt;br&gt;
For L2 pronounciation, there are two principles that haven been put forth by Levis (2005). The first is nativeness which means the speakers' ability to approximately reach the speaking pattern of the second language of speakers; and the second, understanding, refers to the speaker's ability to make themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levis |first1=John |title=Changing Contexts and Shifting Paradigms in Pronunciation Teaching |journal=TESOL Quarterly |date=Autumn 2005 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=369-377 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/3588485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being successful in learning a second language can seem like a daunting task. Research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others. Stern (1975), Rubin (1975) and Reiss (1985) are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject. They have worked to determine what qualities make a "good language learner" (Mollica, Neussel, 1997). Some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, has a strong drive to communicate, and has a good ear and good listening skills (Mollica, Neussel, 1997).&lt;br&gt;

Özgür and Griffiths have designed an experiment in 2013 about the relationship between different motivations and second language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Özgür |first1=Burcu |last2=Griffiths |first2=Carol |title=Second Language Motivation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |date=25 January 2013 |volume=70 |pages=1109-1114 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813001663}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have looked at four types of motivations—intrinsic (inner feelings of learner), extrinsic (reward from outside), integrative (attitude towards learning), and instrumental (practical needs). According to the test results, the intrinsic part has been the main  motivation for these student who learn English as their second language. However, students report themselves being strongly instrumentally motivated. In conclusion, learning a second language and being successful depend on every individual.&lt;br&gt;

==Foreign language==
[[File:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|A German student learning French. [[English language|English]] (1.5 billion learners), [[French language|French]] (82 million learners) and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (30 million learners) are the three most commonly studied foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Noack and Lazaro Gamio, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/23/the-worlds-languages-in-7-maps-and-charts "The world’s languages, in 7 maps and charts"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 April 2015 (page visited on 9 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

In [[pedagogy]] and [[sociolinguistics]], a distinction is made between second language and foreign language, the latter is being learned for use in an area where that language is originally from another country and not spoken in the native country of the speakers. And in other words, foreign language is used from the perspective of countries; the second language is used from the perspective of individuals.

For example, arguably, [[English language|English]] in countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[the Philippines]], the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Netherlands]] can be considered a second language for many of its speakers, because they learn it young and use it regularly; indeed in [[southern Asia]] it is the [[official language]] of the courts, government and business. The same can be said for [[French language|French]] in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], although French is nominally not an official language in any of these [[Arabic-speaking countries]]. In practice, French is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries, and public signs are normally printed in both Arabic and French. A similar phenomenon exists in [[post-Soviet states]] such as the [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], where [[Russian language|Russian]] can be considered a second language, and there are large [[Russophone]] communities there.

However, in [[China]] (with the exception perhaps of Hong Kong), English must be considered a foreign language due to the lack of opportunities for use, such as historical links, media, conversation between people, and similar vocabulary. Likewise, French would be considered a foreign language in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. This is despite Romanian and French being [[Romance languages]] (unlike Chinese and English, which come from two different [[language families]]: [[Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This is also despite Romania and Moldova being the only two countries in the world where Romanian is an official language at the national level, Romania's historical links to France, and both Romanian-speaking countries' membership in the [[Francophonie]].
== Benefits of Bilingualism ==
Psychological studies have found that speaking two or more languages is good for people's cognitive process and the differences between brains of bilinguals and single language speakers usually provides some mental benefits, according to an article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Merritt |first1=Anne |title=Why learn a foreign language? Benefits of bilingualism |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10126883/Why-learn-a-foreign-language-Benefits-of-bilingualism.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including but not limited to these: &lt;br&gt;
'''Becoming smarter'''&lt;br&gt;
Speaking a second language improves the functions of the brain by thinking and using the different language systems.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building multitasking skills'''&lt;br&gt;
According to a study from the Pennsylvania State University, "juggling language can make better brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juggling languages can build better brains |url=https://news.psu.edu/story/160653/2011/02/18/juggling-languages-can-build-better-brains |website=PennState |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because multilingual people are usually good at switching between different language systems, they can be good multitaskers as well. &lt;br&gt;
'''Improving memory'''&lt;br&gt;
The vocabulary capacity for a high school graduate student is about 45000 words, according to Nagy and Anderson (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagy |first1=William |last2=Anderson |first2=Richard |title=How Many Words are There in Printed School English? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly |date=Spring 1984 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=304-330 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/747823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and being a bilingual will double this number because learning a language involves memorizing rules and vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;

George H. J. Weber, a Swiss businessman and independent scholar, founder of the Andaman Association and creator of the encyclopedic andaman.org Web site, made a report in December 1997 about the number of secondary speakers of the world's leading languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ignatius.edu/turner/languages.htm The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt; Weber used the [[Fischer Weltalmanach]] of 1986 as his only source&lt;ref&gt;Fig 6.

'''Sparsha''' (literally name; of Parbat Chimariya :;"Parbat Sparsha")
'''Sparśa''' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''phassa'') is a Sanskrit/Indian term that is translated as "contact", "touching", "sensation", "sense impression", etc. It is defined as the coming together of three factors: the [[Ayatana|sense organ]], the [[Ayatana|sense object]], and [[Vijnana|sense consciousness (vijnana)]].&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 401-405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, contact (''sparsha'') is said to occur at the coming together of the eye organ, a visual object, and the visual sense consciousness.

Sparśa is identified within the Buddhist teachings as:
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Seven universal mental factors|''seven universal mental factors'']] in the Theravada Abhidharma.
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Five universal mental factors|''five universal mental factors'']] in the Mahayana Abhidharma
* The sixth link in the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links of dependent origination]]

==Explanation==

===Theravada===
The [[Atthasālinī]] (Expositor, Part IV, Chapter I, 108) states:

: Contact means “it touches”. It has touching as its salient characteristic, impact as its function, “coinciding” (of the physical base, object and consciousness) as its manifestation, and the object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Contact.html#Contact Definition of Contact]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:Phassa is manifested by coinciding or concurrence, namely, by the coinciding of three factors: physical base (vatthu), object and consciousness.

:When there is seeing, there is the coinciding of eye (the eyebase), visible object and seeing-consciousness; through this concurrence phassa, which is in this case eye-contact, is manifested.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

Nina van Gorkom also explains:
:Phassa is different from what we mean in conventional language by physical contact or touch. When we use the word contact in conventional language we may think of the impingement of something external on one of the senses, for example the impingement of hardness on the bodysense. We may use words such as touching or impingement in order to describe phassa, but we should not forget that phassa is nāma, a cetasika which arises together with the citta and assists the citta so that it can experience the object which presents itself through the appropriate doorway. When hardness presents itself through the bodysense there is phassa, contact, arising together with the citta which experiences the hardness. Phassa is not the mere collision of hardness with the bodysense, it is not touch in the physical sense. Impact is the function of phassa in the sense that it assists the citta so that it can cognize the object.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

===Mahayana===
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states:
:What is sparsha (contact)? It is it determination, a transformation in the controlling power, which is in accordance with the three factors coming together. Its function is to provide it basis for feeling.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

Herbert Guenther explains:
: It is an awareness in which a pleasant [or unpleasant or neutral] feeling is felt when the object, sensory capacity, and cognitive process have come together and which is restricted to the appropriate object. Transformation in the controlling power means that when the visual sense meets a pleasant object [for example] and the feeling becomes the cause of adhering to this pleasure, rapport [sparsha] restricts the pleasant color-form and the feeling becomes the cause of pleasure.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

===Six classes===
The Theravada and Mahayana traditions both identify six "classes" of contact:&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html Paticca-samuppada-vibhanga Sutta: Analysis of Dependent Co-arising, SN 12.2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* eye-contact
* ear-contact 
* nose-contact 
* tongue-contact 
* body-contact 
* mind-contact

For example, when the ''ear sense'' and a ''sound object'' are present, the associated ''auditory consciousness'' (Pali: [[viññāṇa]]) arises. The arising of these three elements (dhātu) – ear-sense, sound and auditory consciousness – lead to "contact" (phassa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html Chachakka Sutta: The Six Sextets M148]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the twelve nidanas==
Sparśa is the sixth of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Nidānas]].  It is conditioned by the presence of the ''six sense-openings'' ([[Sadayatana|''{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}'']]), and in turn is a condition for the arising of physical ''sensations'' ([[Vedana|''vedanā'']]).

Dan Lusthaus explains:
:''sparśa'' (P. ''phassa'') - Literally 'touch' or 'sensory contact'. This term accrued varied usages in later Indian thought, but here it simply means that the sense organs are 'in contact with' sensory objects. The circuit of intentionality, or to borrow Merleau-Ponty's term ''intentional arc'', is operational. This term could be translated as 'sensation' as long as this is qualified as a constitutional, active process that is invariably contextualized within its psycho-cognitive dimensions. For Buddhists, sensation can neither be passive nor purely a physical or neurological matter. When the proper sensorial conditions aggregate, i.e., come into contact with each other, sensation occurs. These proper conditions include a properly functioning sense organ and a cognitive-sensory object, which already presuppose a linguistically-complex conscious body (''nāma-rūpa'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59 Buddhist Phenomenology, Dan Lusthaus, p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Hopkins explains:
:Roughly speaking, [sparsha refers to] the coming together of an object, a sense organ, and a moment of consciousness. Hence contact, in the twelve links, refers to contact with a sense-object and the subsequent discrimination of the object as attractive, unattractive, or neutral. Sense objects are always present, and thus when a sense organ—the subtle matter that allows you to see, hear, and so forth—develops,&lt;ref&gt;The sense organs develop in the fifth link of the Twelve Links.&lt;/ref&gt; an eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose consciousness, tongue consciousness, or body consciousness will be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1992), p. 18 (from the Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] provides an explanation of the sixth link in the context of the development of the fetus; he states:
:The sixth of the twelve links of dependent arising. The subsidiary awareness (mental factor) of contacting awareness [sparsha] during the period of time in the development of a fetus when the distinguishing aggregate and such other affecting variables as contacting awareness are functioning, but the feeling aggregate is not yet functioning. During this period, one experiences contacting awareness of objects as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, but does not feel happy, unhappy, or neutral in response to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary_tibetan.html#xreg-pa Definitions of Sparsha (Tibetan: reg-pa), Alexander Berzin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the five aggregates==
In terms of the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]], sparśa is the ''implicit'' basis by which Form (''[[rūpa]]'') and Consciousness (''[[Vijnana|viññāna]]'') lead to the mental factors of Feeling (''[[Vedana|vedanā]]''), Perception (''[[Samjna|sañña]]'') and Formations (''[[sankhara|sankhāra]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3989">In [[representation theory]], the '''stable module category''' is a category in which projectives are "factored out."

== Definition ==
Let ''R'' be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. For two [[module (mathematics)|module]]s ''M'' and ''N'', define &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of ''R''-linear maps from ''M'' to ''N'' modulo the relation that ''f''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''g'' if ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g'' factors through a [[projective module]]. The stable module category is defined by setting the objects to be the ''R''-modules, and the morphisms are the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M,N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a module ''M'', let ''P'' be a projective module with a surjection &lt;math&gt;p \colon P \to M&lt;/math&gt;. Then set &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M)&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''p''. Suppose we are given a morphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; and a surjection &lt;math&gt;q \colon Q \to N&lt;/math&gt; where ''Q'' is projective. Then one can lift ''f'' to a map &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt; which maps &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\Omega(N)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives a well-defined functor &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; from the stable module category to itself.

For certain rings, such as [[Frobenius algebra]]s, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence of categories]]. In this case, the inverse &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows. Given ''M'', find an [[injective module]] ''I'' with an inclusion &lt;math&gt;i \colon M \to I&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the [[cokernel]] of ''i''. A case of particular interest is when the ring ''R'' is a [[group algebra]].

The functor Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; can even be defined on the module category of a general ring (without factoring out projectives), as the cokernel of the [[injective envelope]].  It need not be true in this case that the functor Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is actually an inverse to Ω.  One important property of the stable module category is it allows defining the Ω functor for general rings.  When ''R'' is [[perfect ring|perfect]] (or ''M'' is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] and ''R'' is [[semiperfect ring|semiperfect]]), then Ω(''M'') can be defined as the kernel of the [[projective cover]], giving a functor on the module category.  However, in general projective covers need not exist, and so passing to the stable module category is necessary.

== Connections with cohomology ==
Now we suppose that ''R = kG'' is a group algebra for some [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' and some [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G''. One can show that there exist isomorphisms
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(\Omega^n(M), N) \cong \mathrm{Ext}^n_{kG}(M,N) \cong \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M, \Omega^{-n}(N))&lt;/math&gt;
for every positive integer ''n''. The [[group cohomology]] of a representation ''M'' is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}^n(G; M) = \mathrm{Ext}^n_{kG}(k, M)&lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' has a trivial ''G''-action, so in this way the stable module category gives a natural setting in which group cohomology lives. 

Furthermore, the above isomorphism suggests defining cohomology groups for negative values of ''n'', and in this way, one recovers [[Tate cohomology]].

== Triangulated structure ==

An exact sequence 
: &lt;math&gt; 0 \to X \to E \to Y \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
in the usual module category defines an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ext}^1_{kG}(Y,X)&lt;/math&gt;, and hence an element of &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(Y, \Omega^{-1}(X))&lt;/math&gt;, so that we get a sequence
: &lt;math&gt; X \to E \to Y \to \Omega^{-1}(X).&lt;/math&gt;
Taking &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be the translation functor and such sequences as above to be exact triangles, the stable module category becomes a [[triangulated category]].

The '''Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection''' ({{lang-sv|Säkerhets- och integritetsskyddsnämnden}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Government agencies in Sweden|administrative authority]] sorting under the [[Ministry of Justice (Sweden)|Ministry of Justice]] responsible for supervising [[law enforcement]] agencies' use of secret surveillance techniques, [[Undercover operation|assumed identities]] and other associated activities. The commission also supervise the processing of personal data by the [[Swedish Police Authority]]. It is also obliged to check whether someone has been the subject of secret surveillance or subject to the processing of personal data, at the request of an individual, and if it was done within bounds of applicable legislation.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection|url=http://www.sakint.se/InEnglish.htm|publisher=Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=instruction&gt;{{cite web|title=Förordning (2007:1141) med instruktion för Säkerhets- och integritetsskyddsnämnden|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-20071141-med-ins_sfs-2007-1141/?bet=2007:1141|publisher=The [[Government of Sweden]]|accessdate=13 August 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esv&gt;{{cite web|title=Regleringsbrev|url=http://www.esv.se/Verktyg--stod/Statsliggaren/Regleringsbrev/?RBID=16191|publisher=[[Swedish National Financial Management Authority]]|accessdate=13 August 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Erotic''' is a specialized term coined by writer and educator [[Audre Lorde]] in her essay "Uses of the Erotic: Erotic as Power". The Erotic is described as a source of personal power and political power. According to her it is often confused with the [[Pornography|pornographic]] and often seen as suspicious in a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. The word 'erotic' is derived from the Greek word [[Eros (concept)|eros]]. Eros personifies "love in all its aspects".

== Beyond pornography==
According to Lorde, the erotic has often been confused with the pornographic, resulting in the terms being used interchangeably within western societies. Lorde dismantles this idea and explains that the two are opposites of each other. According to Lorde, "pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling". The erotic is defined by our deepest feelings within ourselves while the pornographic "emphasizes sensation" and completely dismisses feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lorde|first1=Audre|title=The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power|url=http://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/11881_Chapter_5.pdf|website=uk.sagepub|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catharine MacKinnon]] takes Lorde’s concept of pornography being used as a form of oppression and adds to it by asserting that pornography not only works to oppress the erotic power of women, but that it also suppresses women’s freedom of speech. Pornography eroticizes “the unspeakable abuse: the rape, the battery, the sexual harassment, the prostitution, and the sexual abuse of children. Only in the pornography it is called something else: sex, sex, sex, sex, and sex, respectively” which thus contributes to the perpetuation of inequality between men and women and leads to the normalization of these kinds of atrocities. 
The erotic power that Lorde claims “lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane” becomes twisted, perverted and used against women to maintain female subordination. MacKinnon connects these images and words to actual cases of rape and sexual assault in that it men take what they have seen in porn and then apply it to their own sexual interactions with women. She quotes a study that claims that men who watched pornography that depicted rape and sexual assault were more inclined towards aggressive behavior towards women and self-reported a greater likelihood that they would engage in acts of rape or sexual assault. These images desensitize men to this kind of aggressive behavior and therefore, when women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped, their voices are not heard because being sexually assaulted or raped is an accepted part of culture represented in pornography. Pornography silences women because it steals their credibility and replaces it with mere “eroticism” which was originally a female ascribed power. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine|title=Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech|journal=Readings in Moral Philosophy|date=2018|page=|pages=268-278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''triple bottom line''' (or otherwise noted as '''TBL''' or '''3BL''') is an [[accounting]] framework with three parts: social, environmental (or ecological) and financial. Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value.&lt;ref name=IBR&gt;Slaper, Timothy F. and Hall, Tanya J. (2011). [http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/ibr/2011/spring/article2.html "The Triple Bottom Line: What Is It and How Does It Work?"] ''Indiana Business Review''. Spring 2011, Volume 86, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Business writer [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] claims to have coined the phrase in 1994.&lt;ref name=recall&gt;Elkington, J. (2018), "25 Years Ago I Coined the Phrase "Triple Bottom Line." Here's Why It's Time to Rethink It", ''Harvard Business Review'', 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triple Bottom Line|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14301663|accessdate=14 August 2014|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In traditional business accounting and common usage, the "[[bottom line]]" refers to either the "profit" or "loss", which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and [[social justice]] advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing [[full cost accounting]]. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from [[asbestosis]], and their [[copper mine]] pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal [[cost benefit analysis]]? The triple bottom line adds two more "bottom lines": social and environmental (ecological) concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ges/umw/dos/nac/den/en3106180.htm Sustainability – From Principle To Practice] ''[[Goethe-Institut]]'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With the ratification of the [[United Nations]] and [[ICLEI]] TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/industrryRoleOfIndclean.pdf|title=Enhancing the role of industry through for example, private-public partnerships], May 2011. [[United Nations Environment Programme]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this became the dominant approach to [[public sector]] full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to [[natural capital]] and [[human capital]] measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting [[ecological footprint]]. Use of the TBL is fairly widespread in [[South African media]], as found in a 1990–2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262009650_What_the_Papers_Say_Trends_in_Sustainability_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_115_Leading_National_Newspapers_Worldwide|title=What the Papers Say: Trends in Sustainability. A Comparative Analysis of 115 Leading National Newspapers Worldwide (PDF Download Available)|last=Barkemeyer|first=Ralf|last2=Figge|first2=Frank|date=March 2009|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-31|last3=Hahn|first3=Tobias|last4=Holt|first4=Diane L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an organization seeking a triple bottom line would be a [[social enterprise]] run as a non-profit, but earning income by offering opportunities for handicapped people who have been labelled "unemployable", to earn a living by [[recycling]]. The organization earns a profit, which is controlled by a volunteer Board, and ploughed back into the community. The social benefit is the meaningful employment of disadvantaged citizens, and the reduction in the society's welfare or disability costs. The environmental benefit comes from the recycling accomplished. In the [[private sector]], a commitment to [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) implies a commitment to transparent reporting about the business' material impact for good on the environment and people. Triple bottom line is one framework for reporting this material impact. This is distinct from the more limited changes required to deal only with ecological issues. The triple bottom line has also been extended to encompass four pillars, known as the quadruple bottom line (QBL). The fourth pillar denotes a future-oriented approach (future generations, intergenerational equity, etc.). It is a long-term outlook that sets sustainable development and sustainability concerns apart from previous social, environmental, and economic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waite|first=Marilyn|date=2013-11-18|title=SURF Framework for a Sustainable Economy|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jms/article/view/27508|journal=Journal of Management and Sustainability|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=25|doi=10.5539/jms.v3n4p25|issn=1925-4733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges of putting the TBL into practice relate to the measurement of social and ecological categories. Despite this, the TBL framework enables organizations to take a longer-term perspective and thus evaluate the future consequences of decisions.&lt;ref name=IBR /&gt;

==Definition==
[[Sustainable development]] was defined by the [[Brundtland Commission]] of the United Nations in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldfinance.com/banking/egypts-sustainable-finance-trailblazer|title=Egypt’s sustainable finance trailblazer|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple bottom line (TBL) accounting expands the traditional reporting framework to take into account social and environmental performance in addition to financial performance.

In 1981, [[Social enterprise|Freer Spreckley]] first articulated the triple bottom line in a publication called 'Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Audit: A Management Tool for Co-operative Working|last=Spreckley|first=Freer|publisher=Beechwood College|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he argued that enterprises should measure and report on financial performance, social wealth creation, and environmental responsibility. The phrase "triple bottom line" was articulated more fully by [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] in his 1997 book ''Cannibals with Forks: the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business'.'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963459936|title=Cannibals with forks : the triple bottom line of 21st century business|last=Elkington|first=John|date=|publisher=Capstone|year=1999|isbn=9780865713925|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=963459936|author-link=John Elkington (business author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In articulating the concept of triple bottom line, Elkington has also made reference to Jed Emerson's concept of [[blended value]], which refers to the idea that all value consists of social, environmental, and financial components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elkington |first1=John |title=Sustainability should not be consigned to history by Shared Value |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/shared-value-john-elkington-sustainability |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=November 13th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Triple Bottom Line Investing'' group advocating and publicizing these principles was founded in 1998 by [[Robert J. Rubinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2018/05/22/one-key-to-impact-investing-start-big/#eab84e15ddb9|title=One Key To Impact Investing: Start Big|last=Thorpe|first=Devin|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reporting their efforts companies may demonstrate their commitment to [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) through the following:

*Top-level involvement (CEO, Board of Directors)
*Policy Investments
*Programs
*Signatories to voluntary standards
*Principles (UN Global Compact-Ceres Principles)
*Reporting (Global Reporting Initiative)

The concept of TBL demands that a company's responsibility lies with [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] rather than [[shareholders]]. In this case, "stakeholders" refers to anyone who is influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the actions of the firm. Examples of stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers, local residents, government agencies, and creditors. According to the [[stakeholder theory]], the business entity should be used as a vehicle for coordinating stakeholder interests, instead of maximizing shareholder (owner) profit. A growing number of financial institutions incorporate a triple bottom line approach in their work. It is at the core of the business of banks in the [[Global Alliance for Banking on Values]], for example.

The [[Detroit]]-based [[Avalon International Breads]] interprets the triple bottom line as consisting of "Earth", "Community", and "Employees".&lt;ref name="Avalon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avalonbreads.net/about-us/triple-bottom-line/|title=Triple Bottom Line: Earth, Community, Employees|last=|first=|date=|website=Avalon International Breads|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three bottom lines===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
The triple bottom line consists of social equity, economic, and environmental factors. The phrase, "people, planet, and profit" to describe the triple bottom line and the goal of [[sustainability]], was coined by John Elkington in 1994 while at Sustain Ability,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was later used as the title of the Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell's first sustainability report in 1997. As a result, one country in which the 3P concept took deep root was The Netherlands.

==== People, the social equity bottom line ====
The people, social equity, or [[human capital]] bottom line pertains to fair and beneficial business practices toward labour and the community and region in which a corporation conducts its business. A TBL company conceives a reciprocal [[social structure]] in which the well-being of corporate, labour and other stakeholder interests are interdependent.

An enterprise dedicated to the triple bottom line seeks to provide benefit to many constituencies and not to exploit or endanger any group of them. The "upstreaming" of a portion of profit from the marketing of finished goods back to the original producer of raw materials, for example, a farmer in [[fair trade]] agricultural practice, is a common feature. In concrete terms, a TBL business would not use child labour and monitor all contracted companies for child labour exploitation, would pay fair salaries to its workers, would maintain a safe work environment and tolerable working hours, and would not otherwise exploit a community or its labour force. A TBL business also typically seeks to "give back" by contributing to the strength and growth of its community with such things as health care and education. Quantifying this bottom line is relatively new, problematic and often subjective. The [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI) has developed guidelines to enable corporations and [[NGO]]s alike to comparably report on the social impact of a business.

==== Planet, the environmental bottom line ====
The planet, environmental bottom line, or [[natural capital]] bottom line refers to sustainable environmental practices. A TBL company endeavors to benefit the natural order as much as possible or at the least do no harm and minimize environmental impact. A TBL endeavour reduces its [[ecological footprint]] by, among other things, carefully managing its consumption of energy and non-renewables and reducing manufacturing waste as well as rendering waste less [[Toxicity|toxic]] before disposing of it in a safe and legal manner. "[[Cradle to grave]]" is uppermost in the thoughts of TBL manufacturing businesses, which typically conduct a [[life cycle assessment]] of products to determine what the true environmental cost is from the growth and harvesting of raw materials to manufacture to distribution to eventual disposal by the end user.

Currently, the cost of disposing of non-degradable or toxic products is borne financially by governments and environmentally by the residents near the disposal site and elsewhere. In TBL thinking, an enterprise which produces and markets a product which will create a waste problem should not be given a free ride by society. It would be more equitable for the business which manufactures and sells a problematic product to bear part of the cost of its ultimate disposal.

Ecologically destructive practices, such as overfishing or other endangering depletions of resources are avoided by TBL companies. Often environmental sustainability is the more profitable course for a business in the long run. Arguments that it costs more to be environmentally sound are often specious when the course of the business is analyzed over a period of time. Generally, sustainability reporting metrics are better quantified and standardized for environmental issues than for social ones. A number of respected reporting institutes and registries exist including the Global Reporting Initiative, CERES, Institute 4 Sustainability and others.

The ecological bottom line is akin to the concept of [[eco-capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gaia Atlas of Green Economics|last=Ekins|first=Paul|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1992|isbn=0-385-41914-7|location=|page=191|pages=|author-link=Paul Ekins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Profit, the economic bottom line ====
The profit or economic bottom line deals with the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital tied up. It therefore differs from traditional accounting definitions of profit. In the original concept, within a sustainability framework, the "profit" aspect needs to be seen as the real economic benefit enjoyed by the host society.  It is the real economic impact the organization has on its economic environment.  This is often confused to be limited to the internal profit made by a company or organization (which nevertheless remains an essential starting point for the computation).  Therefore, an original TBL approach cannot be interpreted as simply traditional corporate accounting profit ''plus'' social and environmental impacts unless the "profits" of other entities are included as a social benefit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Subsequent development==

Following the initial publication of the triple bottom line concept, students and practitioners have sought greater detail in how the pillars can be evaluated.

The ''people'' concept for example can be viewed in three dimensions – organisational needs, individual needs, and community issues.

Equally, ''profit'' is a function of both a healthy sales stream, which needs a high focus on customer service, coupled with the adoption of a strategy to develop new customers to replace those that die away.

And ''planet'' can be divided into a multitude of subdivisions, although [[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse and recycle]] is a succinct way of steering through this division.

=== Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) ===
While Triple Bottom Line inspires companies to take into consideration people, profit and planet simultaneously, Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) takes the concept a step further and encourages companies to integrate their financial, economic and social performance reporting into one integrated balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating these performance measurements into one report will provide a more holistic look into a company's performance and assist decision makers in understanding opportunities for long term value creation that can be leveraged during long term organizational planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy|last=Eccles|first=Robert|last2=Krzus|first2=Michael|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is evidence in support an [[Integrated management|Integrated Management]] approach that prioritizes IBL reporting and asserts that enterprises with strong integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data into reporting and subsequent decision making often out perform firms with weak ESG integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be largely attributed to the new opportunities for value creation that are discovered through the process of collecting, analyzing and understanding the ESG data collected and what it means for a company's long term success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|date=July 2017|title=Integration and Organizational Change Towards Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318126290_Integration_and_Organizational_Change_Towards_Sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=162|pages=315-329|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prioritizing an IBL approach begins with changing the way we think about traditional financial measurements as these do not take into consideration the full extent of the short and long term impacts of a decision or action. Instead, Return on Investment can be expanded to Return on Integration, Internal Rate of Return can evolve into Integrated Rate of Return and instead of focusing on Net Present Value, companies can plan for Integrated Future Value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Supporting arguments==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
The following business-based arguments support the concept of TBL:

*Reaching untapped market potential: TBL companies can find financially profitable niches which were missed when money alone was the driving factor. Examples include:

# Adding [[ecotourism]] or [[geotourism]] to an already rich tourism market such as the [[Dominican Republic]]
# Developing profitable methods to assist existing NGOs with their missions such as fundraising, reaching clients, or creating networking opportunities with multiple NGOs
# Providing products or services which benefit underserved populations and/or the environment which are also financially profitable.

*Adapting to new business sectors: While the number of [[social enterprises]] is growing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/the-peoples-business|title=The People's Business 2013|last=|first=|date=|work=Social Enterprise UK|access-date=July 15, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the entry of the [[B Corporation|B Corp movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2015/03/29/business-leaders-urged-to-find-a-purpose-in-life/|title=Business Leaders Urged To Find A Purpose In Life|date=2015|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Trapp|first1=Roger|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is more demand from consumers and investors for an accounting for social and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-wef-2015-millennial-survey-executivesummary.pdf|title=Mind  the gaps. The 2015 Deloitte Millennial survey|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Deloitt|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] and Ethical Trade companies require ethical and sustainable practices from all of their suppliers and service providers.

[[Fiscal policy]] of governments usually claims to be concerned with identifying social and natural deficits on a less formal basis. However, such choices may be guided more by [[ideology]] than by [[economics]]. The primary benefit of embedding one approach to measurement of these deficits would be first to direct [[monetary policy]] to reduce them, and eventually achieve a global [[monetary reform]] by which they could be systematically and globally reduced in some uniform way.

The argument is that the [[Earth]]'s [[carrying capacity]] is at risk, and that in order to avoid catastrophic breakdown of [[climate]] or [[ecosystem]]s, there is need for comprehensive reform of [[Global financial system|global financial institutions]] similar in scale to what was undertaken at [[Bretton Woods conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1944.

With the emergence of an externally consistent [[green economics]] and agreement on definitions of potentially contentious terms such as [[full-cost accounting]], [[natural capital]] and [[social capital]], the prospect of formal metrics for ecological and social loss or risk has grown less remote since the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the [[United Kingdom]] in particular, the London Health Observatory has undertaken a formal programme to address social deficits via a fuller understanding of what "social capital" is, how it functions in a real [[community]] (that being the [[City of London]]), and how losses of it tend to require both [[financial capital]] and significant political and social attention from [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s and professionals to help resolve.  The data they rely on is extensive, building on decades of statistics of the [[Greater London Council]] since [[World War II]].  Similar studies have been undertaken in [[North America]].

Studies of the [[value of Earth]] have tried to determine what might constitute an ecological or natural life deficit. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] relies on some measures of this sort, and actually relies on some [[value of life]] calculations that, among other things, are explicit about the ratio of the price of a human life between developed and developing nations (about 15 to 1). While the motive of this number was to simply assign responsibility for a cleanup, such stark honesty opens not just an economic but political door to some kind of negotiation &amp;mdash; presumably to reduce that ratio in time to something seen as more equitable. As it is, people in developed nations can be said to benefit 15 times more from [[ecological devastation]] than in developing nations, in pure financial terms. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], they are thus obliged to pay 15 times more per life to avoid a loss of each such life to [[climate change]] &amp;mdash; the [[Kyoto Protocol]] seeks to implement exactly this formula, and is therefore sometimes cited as a first step towards getting nations to accept formal [[legal liability|liability]] for damage inflicted on ecosystems shared globally.

Advocacy for triple bottom line reforms is common in [[Green Parties]]. Some of the measures undertaken in the [[European Union]] towards the [[Euro]] currency integration standardize the reporting of ecological and social losses in such a way as to seem to endorse in principle the notion of unified accounts, or [[unit of account]], for these deficits.

To address financial bottom line profitability concerns, some argue that focusing on the TBL will indeed increase profit for the shareholders in the long run. In practice, [[John Mackey (businessman)|John Mackey]], CEO of [[Whole Foods]], uses Whole Foods's Community Giving Days as an example. On days when Whole Foods donates 5% of their sales to charity, this action benefits the community, creates goodwill with customers, and energizes employees—which may lead to increased, sustainable profitability in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/20/whole-foods-john-mackey/|title=John Mackey: The conscious capitalist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While many people agree with the importance of good social conditions and preservation of the environment, there are also many who disagree with the triple bottom line as the way to enhance these conditions. The following are the reasons why:

* ''Reductive method'': Concurrently the environment comes to be treated as an externality or background feature, an externality that tends not to have the human dimension build into its definition. Thus, in many writings, even in those critical of the triple-bottom-line approach, the social becomes a congeries of miscellaneous considerations left over from the other two prime categories.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2010 | last1= Scerri | first1= Andy | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative approaches, such as [[Circles of Sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul James and Andy Scerri, ‘Auditing Cities through Circles of Sustainability’, Mark Amen, Noah J. Toly, Patricia L. Carney and Klaus Segbers, eds, ''Cities and Global Governance'', Ashgate, Farnham, 2011, pp. 111–36.&lt;/ref&gt; that treat the economic as a social domain, alongside and in relation to the ecological, the political and the cultural are now being considered as more appropriate for understanding institutions, cities and regions.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scerri | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.027 | title = Ends in view: The capabilities approach in ecological/sustainability economics | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 77 | pages = 7–10 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, &amp; Andy Scerri (2012) ‘From Issues to Indicators: A Response to Grosskurth and Rotmans’, Local Environment 17(8): 915-933.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Social inertia|Inertia]]'': The difficulty of achieving global agreement on [[simultaneous policy]] may render such measures at best advisory, and thus unenforceable. For example, people may be unwilling to undergo a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] or even sustained [[recession]] to replenish lost [[ecosystem]]s. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* ''Application'': According to Fred Robins' ''The Challenge of TBL: A Responsibility to Whom?'' one of the major weaknesses of the TBL framework is its ability to be applied in the practical world.
* ''Equating ecology with environment'': TBL is seen to be disregarding ecological sustainability with environmental effects, where in reality both economic and social viability is dependent on environmental well being. While [[greenwashing]] is not new, its use has increased over recent years to meet consumer demand for environmentally friendly goods and services. The problem is compounded by lax enforcement by regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Competition Bureau in Canada, and the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice in the United Kingdom. Critics of the practice suggest that the rise of greenwashing, paired with ineffective regulation, contributes to consumer skepticism of all green claims, and diminishes the power of the consumer in driving companies toward greener solutions for manufacturing processes and business operation.
* ''Time dimension'': While the triple bottom line incorporates the social, economical and environmental (People, Planet, Profit) dimensions of sustainable development, it does not explicitly address the fourth dimension: time. The time dimension focuses on preserving current value in all three other dimensions for later. This means assessment of short term, longer term and long term consequences of any action.&lt;ref&gt;Lozano, R. (2012). "Towards better embedding sustainability into companies’ systems: an analysis of voluntary corporate initiatives," ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 25 pp. 14-26&lt;/ref&gt;
*"One problem with the triple bottom line is that the three separate accounts cannot easily be added up. It is difficult to measure the planet and people accounts in the same terms as profits—that is, in terms of cash."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14301663|title=Triple bottom line -  It consists of three Ps: profit, people and planet|last=|first=|date=|website=The Economist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to TBL being augmented with [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] in [[Triple Bottom Line (TBL) Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)|Triple Bottom Line Cost Benefit Analysis (TBL-CBA)]].
*Elkington himself has called for a rethink on TBL and a "product recall" on use of the concept. He argues that the original idea was to encourage businesses to manage the wider economic, social and environmental impacts of their operations, but its practical use as an accounting tool has now undermined its value.&lt;ref name=recall /&gt;
*This is summarised below as:
** attempting to divert the attention of regulators and deflating pressure for regulatory change;
** seeking to persuade critics, such as non-government organisations, that they are both well-intentioned and have changed their ways;
** seeking to expand market share at the expense of those rivals not involved in greenwashing; this is especially attractive if little or no additional expenditure is required to change ''performance''; alternatively, a company can engage in greenwashing in an attempt to narrow the perceived 'green' advantage of a rival;
** reducing staff turnover and making it easier to attract staff in the first place;
** making the company seem attractive for potential investors, especially those interested in ethical investment or socially responsive investment.
** inability to add up the three accounts unless tools such as [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] are added to put social and environmental [[Externality|externalities]] in monetary terms.

==Legislation==
A focus on people, planet and profit has led to legislation changes around the world, often through [[social enterprise]] or [[Social investing|social investment]] or through the introduction of a new legal form, the [[Community Interest Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Interest Companies|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[BCorp]] movement has been part of a call for legislation change to allow and encourage a focus on social and environmental impact, with BCorp a legal form for a company focused on "stakeholders, not just shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becoming a Legal BCorp|url=https://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/legal-roadmap|publisher=BCorp|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Australia]], the triple bottom line was adopted as a part of the State Sustainability Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830000447/http://www.sustainability.dpc.wa.gov.au/docs/Final%20Strategy/SSSFinal.pdf Government of Western Australia. (2003, September). "Hope for the Future: The Western Australia State Sustainability Strategy"], accessed August 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by the [[Western Australian Government|Government of Western Australia]] but its status was increasingly marginalised by subsequent [[Premier of Western Australia|premier]]s [[Alan Carpenter]] and [[Colin Barnett]].

A '''windpump''' is a type of [[windmill]] which is used for pumping water.

[[File:Molendeolifant.jpg|thumb|[[De Olifant, Burdaard|De Olifant]] at [[Burdaard]], [[Friesland]]]]
Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of wind pumps became widespread across the [[Muslim world]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[East Anglia]] area of [[Great Britain]], from the late [[Middle Ages]] onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.

[[Simon Stevin]]'s work in the ''waterstaet'' involved improvements to the [[sluice]]s and [[spillway]]s to control [[flood]]ing. [[Windmill]]s were already in use to pump the water out, but in ''Van de Molens'' (''On mills''), he suggested improvements, including the idea that the wheels should move slowly, and a better system for meshing of the [[gear teeth]]. These improvements increased the efficiency of the windmills used to pump water out of the [[polder]]s by three times.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Science: Power, Proof &amp; Passion - EP4: Can We Have Unlimited Power?&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[patent]] on his innovation in 1586.&lt;ref name=isis/&gt;

Eight- to ten-bladed windmills were used in the [[Region of Murcia]], [[Spain]], to raise water for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yachtmollymawk.com/2008/11/spanish-water-works/ Water-lifting mills in the [[Region of Murcia]], [[Spain]]&lt;/ref&gt; The drive from the windmill's rotor was led down through the tower and back out through the wall to turn a large wheel known as a ''[[noria]]''. The ''noria'' supported a bucket chain which dangled down into the well. The buckets were traditionally made of wood or clay. These windmills remained in use until the 1950s, and many of the towers are still standing.

Early immigrants to the [[New World]] brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe.&lt;ref name="Brief History"&gt;[http://www.windmillersgazette.com/history.html "Brief History of Windmills in the New World"]&lt;/ref&gt; On US farms, particularly on the [[Great Plains]], wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding ([[tankhouse]]). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by [[Daniel Halladay]] in 1854.&lt;ref name="Brief History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2003/2/2003_2_56.shtml americanheritage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html fnal.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe, ''Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995  {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, pages 123-127&lt;/ref&gt; Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity.  Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.

The multi-bladed wind pump or wind [[turbine]] atop a lattice tower made of wood or steel hence became, for many years, a fixture of the landscape throughout rural America. These mills, made by a variety of manufacturers, featured a large number of blades so that they would turn slowly with considerable [[torque]] in moderate winds and be self-regulating in high winds.  A tower-top [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[crankshaft]] converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Today, rising energy costs and improved pumping technology are increasing interest in the use of this once declining technology.

==Worldwide use==
[[File:Wicken Fen Windpump.jpg|thumb|A working wooden windpump on [[The Fens]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], UK]]
The [[Netherlands]] is well known for its windmills.  Most of these iconic structures situated along the edge of [[polders]] are actually windpumps, designed to drain the land.  These are particularly important as much of the country lies below [[sea level]].

In the UK, the term ''windpump'' is rarely used, and they are better known as ''drainage windmills''. Many of these were built in [[The Broads]] and [[The Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] for the draining of land, but most of them have since been replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or electric powered pumps. Many of the original windmills still stand in a derelict state although some have been restored.

Windpumps are used extensively in [[Southern Africa]], Australia, and on farms and ranches in the central plains and Southwest of the United States. In South Africa and Namibia thousands of windpumps are still operating. These are mostly used to provide water for human use as well as drinking water for large sheep stocks.

[[Kenya]] has also benefited from the African development of windpump technologies. At the end of the 1970s, the UK [[NGO]] [[Intermediate Technology Development Group]] provided engineering support to the Kenyan company Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd for the development of the Kijito windpumps. Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd is still manufacturing the Kijito windpumps, and more than 300 of them are operating in the whole of [[East Africa]].

In many parts of the world, a [[rope pump]] is being used in conjunction with wind turbines. This easy-to- construct pump works by pulling a knotted rope through a pipe (usually a simple PVC pipe) causing the water to be pulled up into the pipe. This type of pump has become common in [[Nicaragua]] and other places.

==Construction==
To construct a windpump, the bladed rotor needs to be matched to the pump. With non-electric windpumps, high [[Blade solidity|solidity]] rotors are best used in conjunction with positive displacement (piston) pumps, because single-acting piston pumps need about three times as much torque to start them as to keep them going. Low solidity rotors, on the other hand, are best used with [[centrifugal pump]]s, [[waterladder pump]]s and chain and washer pumps, where the torque needed by the pump for starting is less than that needed for running at design speed. Low solidity rotors are best used if they are intended to drive an electricity generator; which in turn can drive the pump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E10.htm Water lifting devices; matching bladed rotors to pumps]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-bladed windpumps==
[[File:Wind-powered-agricultural-pump-1.jpg|thumb|Wind powered water pump on Oak Park Farm, Shedd, Oregon.]]
Multi-bladed wind pumps can be found worldwide and are manufactured in the United States, Argentina, China, New Zealand, and South Africa. A 16&amp;nbsp;ft (4.8&amp;nbsp;m) diameter wind pump can lift up to 1600 US gallons (about 6.4 metric tons) of water per hour to an elevation of 100&amp;nbsp;ft with a 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph wind (24–32&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmanwindmill.com Iron Man Windmill Website pumping capacity calculator], retrieved January 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However they take a strong wind to start so they turn over the crank of the piston pump. Wind pumps require little maintenance—usually only a change of gear box oil annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aermotorwindmill.com/Sales/CommonQuestions.asp Aermotor Web site frequently asked questions], retrieved Sept. 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60,000 wind pumps are still in use in the United States. They are particularly attractive for use at remote sites where electric power is not available and maintenance is difficult to provide.

A common multi-bladed windpump usefully pumps with about 4%–8% of the annual windpower passing through the area it sweeps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/30361.pdf Argaw, N.,"Renewable Energy for Water Pumping Applications in Rural Villages",2003, NREL Report 30361, page 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprl.ars.usda.gov/REMM%20Pubs/1997%20Performance%20and%20Economic%20Comparison%20of%20a%20Mechanical%20Windmill%20to%20a%20Wind-Electric%20Water%20Pumping%20System.pdf Brian Vick, Nolan Clark "Performance and Economic Comparison of a Mechanical Windmill to Wind-Electric Water Pumping System", 1997, USDA-Agricultural Research Service, see Figure-2]&lt;/ref&gt;  This lower conversion is due to poor load matching between wind rotors and fixed-stroke piston pumps.

==Fundamental problems of multi-bladed windpumps==

===Inefficient rotor===
[[File:Derelict windpump with water tank in the foreground next to the Boorowa railway in Galong NSW Australia.JPG|thumb|Derelict water tank with windmill in the background]]
The main design feature of a multi-bladed rotor is "high starting torque", which is necessary for cranking a piston pump operation. Once started a multi-bladed rotor runs at too high a tipspeed ratio at less than its best efficiency of 30%  .&lt;ref name="Hau 2005, page 101"&gt;Hau, Erich "Wind Turbines", 2005, page 101, Fig.5-10&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, modern wind rotors can operate at an aerodynamic efficiency of more than 40% at higher tipspeed ratio for a smaller swirl added and wasted to the wind.&lt;ref name="Hau 2005, page 101"/&gt; But they would need a highly variable stroke mechanism rather than just a crank to piston pump.

===Poor load matching===

A multi-bladed windmill is a mechanical device with a piston pump. Because a piston pump has a fixed stroke, the energy demand of this type of pump is proportional to pump speed only. On the other hand, the energy supply of a wind rotor is proportional to the cube of wind speed. Because of that, a wind rotor runs at over speed (more speed than needed), yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency.

A variable stroke would match the rotor speed according to wind speed, functioning like a "variable-speed generator".  The flow rate of variable stroke windpump can be increased two times, compared to fixed stroke windpumps at the same wind speed.&lt;ref name="ena.com.tr"&gt;[http://www.ena.com.tr/Wind90.pdf Clark, Nolan "Variable Stroke Pumping for Mechanical Windmills", 1990, AWEA Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclic torque variation===

A piston pump has a very light   suction phase,  but the upstroke is heavy and puts a big backtorque on a starting rotor when the crank is horizontal and ascending.   A counterweight on the crank up in the tower and yawing with the wind direction can at least spread the torque to the crank descent.

==Development of improved windpumps==

Although multi-bladed windpumps are based on proven technology and are widely used, they have the fundamental problems mentioned above and need a practical variable stroke mechanism .

===USDA experiments at Texas===
Between 1988 and 1990, a variable stroke windpump was tested at the USDA-Agriculture Research Center-Texas, based on two patented designs (Don E. Avery Patent #4.392.785, 1983 and Elmo G. Harris Patent #617.877, 1899).&lt;ref name="ena.com.tr"/&gt; Control systems of the variable stroke wind pumps were mechanical and hydraulic; however, those experiments did not attract the attention of any windpump manufacturer. After experiments with this variable stroke windpump, research focused on wind-electric water pumping systems; no commercial variable stroke windpump exists yet.

===Fluttering windpumps===

Fluttering windpumps have been developed in Canada with a  pump stroke varying strongly with amplitude to absorb all the variable power in the wind and to stop the uniblade from swinging too far beyond horizontal from its vertical mean position. They are much lighter and use less material than multiblade windpumps and can pump effectively in lighter wind regimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econologica.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIj7LCtX0U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish experiments===
A Turkish engineer re-designed the variable stroke windpump technology by using modern electronic control equipment. Research began in 2004, with governmental R&amp;D support. The first commercial new generation variable stroke wind pumps have been designed after ten years of R&amp;D. The 30&amp;nbsp;kW variable stroke windpump design includes a Darrieus-type modern wind rotor, counterbalance and regenerative brake technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.com.tr/english.htm ENA Yelkapan Technologies Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinations==

===''Tjasker''===
{{Main article|tjasker}}
[[File:Tjasker Sanpoel 04.JPG|thumb|The ''tjasker'']]
In the [[Netherlands]], the ''tjasker'' is a drainage mill with [[windmill sail#Common sails|common sails]] connected to an [[Archimedean screw]]. This is used for pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required. The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to pivot. The Archimedean screw lifts water into a collecting ring, where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level, thus draining the land.&lt;ref name=Tjasker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/types.htm|title=The types of windmills|publisher=Odur|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thai windpumps===
In Thailand, windpumps are traditionally built on Chinese windpump designs. These pumps are constructed from wire-braced bamboo poles carrying fabric or bamboo-mat sails; a paddle pump or [[waterladder pump]] is fixed to a [[Thai bladed rotor]]. They are mainly used in [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] where the water lift required is typically less than 1 meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smulders|first=P.T.|date=January 1996|title=Wind water pumping: the forgotten option|journal=[[Energy for Sustainable Development]]|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://www.energieautark.at/cms/dmdocuments/WindwaterpumpingAfrica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7824">A '''womance''', also called '''sismance''', is a close but non-[[Human sexuality|sexual]] relationship between two or more [[Woman|women]].&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammarén"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara20130602"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara20110919"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt; It is an exceptionally tight [[affectional orientation|affectional]], [[Homosociality|homosocial]] [[female bonding]] relationship exceeding that of usual friendship, and is distinguished by a particularly high level of emotional intimacy.

The word ''womance'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''woman'' and ''romance''.&lt;ref name="Meanley"/&gt; The emergence of the terms [[bromance]] and womance has been seen as reflecting increased relationship-seeking as a modern behavior.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt; Although womance is sometimes seen as the female flip side of ''[[bromance]]'',&lt;ref name="Koehn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wloszczyna"/&gt; some have seen different nuances in the [[social construction]] of the two concepts.&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammarén"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strait"/&gt; Hammarén sees "different values assigned to male and female friendships" and a dissimilarity in the "underlying power relation between the concepts",&lt;ref name="Hammarén"/&gt; and Winch has asserted several differences in the [[social construction]].&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;
