'''Arabic calligraphy''' is the artistic practice of [[penmanship|handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]]&lt;!-- and by extension, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]],--&gt; based on the [[Arabic alphabet]].  It is known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''khatt'' ({{lang-ar|خط}}), derived from the word 'line', 'design', or 'construction'.&lt;ref name=typography&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic calligraphy as a typographic exercise| url=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/07/10/arabic-calligraphy-as-a-typographic-exercise/ |author=Julia Kaestle |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Widany2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan Widany|title=The History of Arabic Calligraphy - an Essay on Its Greatest Artists and Its Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0Wyt3dh5rYC|date=June 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-93875-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kufic]] is the oldest form of the [[Arabic script]].

Although most [[Islamic calligraphy]] is in Arabic and most Arabic calligraphy is Islamic, the two are not identical. [[Coptic Christian]] manuscripts in Arabic, for example, may make use of calligraphy. Likewise, there is Islamic [[Persian calligraphy|calligraphy in Persian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4404">A '''bent''' in [[American English]] is a transverse rigid frame (or similar structures such [[three-hinged arch]]es).  Historically, bents were a common way of making a [[Timber framing|timber frame]]; they are still often used for such, and are also seen in small steel-frame buildings, where the term [[portal frame]] is more commonly used. The term is also used for the cross-ways support structures in a [[trestle]]. In [[British English]] this assembly is called a "cross frame". The term ''bent'' is probably an archaic past tense of the verb ''to bind'', referring to the way the timbers of a bent are joined together. The Dutch word is ''bint'' (past participle ''gebint''),&lt;ref&gt;Woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten II-9, Volume 2; Volume 9 By Antonius A Weijnen Joep Kruijse&lt;/ref&gt; the West Frisian is ''bynt'', and the German is ''bind''.  Compare this with the term [[bend knot|bend]] for a class of knots.

Bents are the building blocks that define the overall shape and character of a structure. They do not have any sort of pre-defined configuration in the way that a [[Truss bridge#Pratt truss|Pratt truss]] does. Rather, bents are simply cross-sectional templates of structural members, i.e., rafters, joists, posts, pilings, etc., that repeat on parallel planes along the length of the structure.  The term bent is not restricted to any particular material.  Bents may be formed of wooden piles, timber framing,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lee Crandall and Fred Asa Barnes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nRM9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 Railroad Construction], McGraw Hill, New York, 1913; Section 97, Principles of Construction, pages 213-215.&lt;/ref&gt; steel framing, or even concrete.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Lacher, The Track Elevation Subways in Chicago, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJQlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA461 Railway Age Gazette], Vol 56, No, 10 (March 6, 1914); page 461.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Bents are generally pre-assembled, either at the timber framing company's shop or at the construction site. After the basic post and beam structure of the frame has been set in place, the bents are then lifted and simply dropped into place one by one by the crane. Next, the workers bring in additional members, [[purlin]]s, which tie them together and give the frame a more rigid structure. This process is very safe and efficient, as it allows a crew to assemble a large portion of the frame without ever stepping off the ground. This, in turn, minimizes the amount of time that the crew must spend several stories in the air clambering along beams not much wider than their own feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">'''[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] System G''' is an analog broadcast [[television]] system used in many countries. There are several systems in use and  letter '''G''' is assigned for the European [[UHF]] system which is also used in the majority of Asian and African countries. (However some countries in Europe use different systems.)

== Specifications ==

Some of the important specs are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System G (UHF Bands).jpg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System G (UHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the audio and video carriers is 5.5 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 '''lines''' (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The RF parameters of the transmitted signal are exactly the same as those for [[CCIR System B|System B]] which is used on the 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels of the [[VHF]] bands. The only difference is the width of the guard band between the channels, which on System G is 1.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wider than for System B: in other words 1.15&amp;nbsp;MHz (assuming the worst case which is when NICAM sound is in use).

== System H ==

A few countries (Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands) use a variant of system '''G''' which is known as [[CCIR System H|System H]]. System '''H''' is similar to system '''G''' but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz wider. This makes much better use of the 8.0&amp;nbsp;MHz channels of the UHF bands by reducing the width of the guard-band by 500&amp;nbsp;kHz to the still perfectly generous value of 650&amp;nbsp;kHz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">'''Chemokinesis''' is [[chemical substance|chemically]] prompted [[kinesis (biology)|kinesis]], a motile response of unicellular [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]] organisms to chemicals that cause the cell to make some kind of change in their migratory/swimming behaviour. Changes involve an increase or decrease of speed, alterations of amplitude or frequency of motile character, or direction of migration. However, in contrast to [[chemotaxis]], chemokinesis has a random, non-vectorial moiety, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Becker EL
| title= Stimulated neutrophil locomotion: chemokinesis and chemotaxis.
| journal= Arch Pathol Lab Med| year= 1977| volume= 101| pages=509–13 | issue=10 | pmid= 199132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the random character, techniques dedicated to evaluate chemokinesis are partly different from methods used in chemotaxis research. One of the most valuable ways to measure chemokinesis is computer-assisted (see, e.g., [[Image J]]) checker-board analysis, which provides data about migration of identical cells, whereas, in Protozoa (e.g., Tetrahymena), techniques  based on measurement of opalescence were also developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1002/bies.950140113 | author= Leick V, Hellung-Larsen P.

{{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'''''|鳥獣人物戯画||literally "Animal-person Caricatures"}}, commonly shortened to {{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-giga'''''|鳥獣戯画||literally "Animal Caricatures"}}, is a famous set of four [[Emakimono|picture scroll]]s, or ''emakimono'', belonging to [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. The ''Chōjū-giga'' scrolls are also referred to as '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals''''' and '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans''''' in English. Some think that [[Toba Sōjō]] created the scrolls; however, it seems clear from the style that more than one artist is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The right-to-left reading direction of ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is  traditional in East Asia, and is still common in Japan. ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is also credited as the oldest work of [[manga]]. The scrolls are now entrusted to the [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Tokyo National Museum]].

The scrolls are the earliest in a linear monochrome drawing style that was to continue in use in [[Japanese painting]] (as they are all done with the usual writing and painting brush, they count as painting).&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  

As opened, the first scroll illustrates [[anthropomorphic]] rabbits and monkeys bathing and getting ready for a ceremony, a monkey thief runs from animals with sticks and knocks over a frog from the lively ceremony. Further on, the rabbits and monkeys are playing and wrestling while another group of animals participate in a funeral and frog prays to Buddha as the scroll closes.

The scrolls were also adapted into several novels published by Geijutsuhiroba, the first book simply compiled the scrolls into one publication, now out of print. One of the books participated as part of the company's ''Fine Arts Log'' series as well as some were exclusive to certain exhibitions. Other companies like Misuzu Shobo and Shibundō also published books based on the ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' emakimono.

Although ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' is sometimes credited as the first manga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ivanov| first=Boris| title=Vvedenie v iaponskuiu animatsiiu| publisher=Фонд развития кинематографии; РОФ «Эйзенштейновский центр исследований кинокультуры» |edition=2| location=Moscow| year=2001 |pages=11| isbn=5-901631-01-3|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some disputes with the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper. Seiki Hosokibara pointed to the ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' scrolls as the first manga, and [[Kanta Ishida]] explained that the scrolls should be treated as masterpieces in their own right.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== Disputes ==
The ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper with Kanta Ishida discussed different theories of what really is the "first manga". [[Mangaka|Manga artist]], Seiki Hosokibara pointed to ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' as the first manga in history. Ishida said that the scrolls be treated as masterpieces in their own right, and not be cubby-holed as just the origin of manga and they have no connection with contemporary manga and the domestic works we are familiar with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Yomiuri'' Newspaper Discusses History's First Manga |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-01-03 |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-01-03/yomiuri-first-manga |accessdate=2009-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-resistance''' is the [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to a usually [[toxic substance]] as a result of exposure to a similarly acting substance. It is a phenomenon affecting e.g. [[pesticide]]s and [[antibiotic]]s. As an example [[rifabutin]] and [[rifampin]] cross react in the treatment of tuberculosis. This sort of resistance is also seen against drugs involved with the treatment of HIV. Drugs ending  with "- ine" and "-inavir" are the most common.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9605">:''For other institutions called "Cumberland College," see [[Cumberland College (disambiguation)]].''
'''Cumberland College''' in [[Princeton, Kentucky]], was founded in 1826 and operated until 1861. It was the first college affiliated with the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]]. In 1842, the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination withdrew its support from Cumberland College in favor of [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. In doing so, the denomination intended to simply relocate the school from Princeton to Lebanon, but Cumberland College remained open without denominational support until the Civil War.

==Founding and early years==
On October 22, 1825, Cumberland Synod, the ruling judicatory of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, resolved to establish a college somewhere in southwestern Kentucky. The school's primary purpose was to educate young men who wanted to become ministers, but the school would be open to all. The school would also require students to perform manual labor for two to three hours a day. The synod appointed a commission to determine a site for the college.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission considered four towns in Kentucky ([[Hopkinsville]], [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]], [[Elkton, Kentucky|Elkton]], and Princeton) and finally chose Princeton on January 13, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission hired [[Franceway Ranna Cossitt|Franceway R. Cossitt]], a Cumberland Presbyterian minister, as the college's president and sole teacher. Classes first began on March 1, 1826. By the end of the year, the college had about sixty students and had hired another teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the college was named, as the synod had resolved, the Cumberland Presbyterian College. However, when the synod requested a charter for the college, members of the Kentucky legislature worried that the original name would stoke sectarian conflict. The legislature therefore dropped "Presbyterian" from the name and issued a charter to Cumberland College on January 8, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumberland College was part of a larger [[Manual labor school|manual labor movement]], as other schools like the [[Oneida Institute]] and [[Oberlin College]] required students to perform physical labor in addition to their study.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman.&lt;/ref&gt; The synod hoped that manual labor would prevent students from sacrificing "bodily vigor" at the expense of "mental energy."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gore 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The college had a working farm, and students worked on the farm two hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830 the college became home to the first Cumberland Presbyterian newspaper, the ''Religious and Literary Intelligencer''. The paper's editor moved to Nashville in 1832 and changed the paper's name to the ''Revivalist''; two years later, it was renamed the ''Cumberland Presbyterian'', and eventually became the denominational organ.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relocation and final years==
The college's largest problem was its indebtedness. The synodical commission had chosen Princeton as the college's site on the strength of local pledges of support amounting to at least $15,000, but few of the pledges were upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 11, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1837 the college was $12,000 in debt, and five years later it was still indebted more than $5,600.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 44, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1842, the General Assembly of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (now the denomination's highest judicatory) responded to the college's indebtedness by appointing a commission to decide whether to relocate the college, and if so where. The commission met in July and decided to relocate the college to Lebanon, Tennessee, whose backers offered $10,000 in cash. Neither the commission nor the General Assembly had the authority to dissolve Cumberland College or to relocate it outside Kentucky. The General Assembly did, however, cease its financial support for the Princeton college and allocated educational funds to the Lebanon college. Also, Franceway Cossitt left the Princeton college to become the Lebanon college's first president. The Lebanon school opened in October 1842. Though it was originally named Cumberland College, it was chartered as Cumberland University on December 30, 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The college in Princeton, Kentucky, remained open. The college ceased its manual labor operations and sold off its farm and farm equipment. By the end of 1842, the college was, for the first time in its history, debt-free.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1844, Green River Synod (an intermediate judicatory of the denomination) agreed to sponsor the college now that the General Assembly no longer sponsored it.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumberland College remained viable until the height of the secession crisis. The college's last class graduated in the fall of 1860, and the college's board of trustees sold off the property.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, wrote a Cumberland Presbyterian historian, "every vestige even of the old buildings" had "disappeared."&lt;ref&gt;McDonnold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qtFLAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mcdonnold+cumberland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=III-VJWSHqa28wGr44HYDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vestige&amp;f=false p. 228].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cemetery and historic marker==
The college's cemetery can be found on a private, residential yard on Traylor Street near Calvary Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kentucky historic marker (number 1453), erected in 1972, stands near the junction of US 62 and KY 91.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 79-80; [http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMDZ7X_Cumberland_Presbyterian_College "Cumberland Presbyterian College"]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080610020910/http://migration.kentucky.gov/kyhs/hmdb/MarkerSearch.aspx Kentucky Historical Society Historic Marker Database].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|The growth rings of a tree at [[Bristol Zoo]], England. Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are the youngest.]]
'''Dendrochronology'''  (or '''tree-ring dating''') is the [[scientific method]] of [[chronological dating|dating]] tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history.

Dendrochronology is useful for determining the timing of events and rates of change in the environment (most prominently climate) and also in works of art and architecture, such as old [[panel painting]]s on wood, buildings, etc. It is also used in [[radiocarbon dating]] to calibrate radiocarbon ages.&lt;ref name=Grissino&gt;{{cite|title=The Science of Tree Rings: Principles of Dendrochronology|first=Henri D.|last=Grissino-Mayer|publisher=Department of Geography, The University of Tennessee|date=n.d.|url=http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|accessdate=October 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104042215/http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New growth in [[tree]]s occurs in a layer of cells near the bark. A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings. Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons, or one year, in the tree's life.&lt;ref name=Grissino /&gt; {{Asof|2013}}, the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reimer |first1=Paula J. |year=2013 |title=IntCal13 and Marine13 radiocarbon age calibration curves 0–50,000 years cal BP |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=55 |pages=1869–1887 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16947 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516010345/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |archivedate=2014-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrochronology derives from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:δένδρον|δένδρον]]}} (''{{lang|la|dendron}}''), meaning "tree", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}} (''{{lang|la|khronos}}''), meaning "time", and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} ''({{lang|la|[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]}}''), "the study of".

== History ==
The Greek botanist [[Theophrastus]] (ca. 371 – ca. 287 BC) first mentioned that the wood of trees has rings.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus with Arthur Hort, trans., ''Enquiry into Plants'', volume 1 (London, England: William Heinemann, 1916), Book V, [https://archive.org/stream/enquiryintoplant01theouoft#page/422/mode/2up p. 423.] From p. 423: "Moreover, the wood of the silver-fir has many layers, like an onion; there is always another beneath that which is visible, and the wood is composed of such layers throughout." Although many sources claim that Theophrastus recognized that trees form growth rings annually, this is not true.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the history of dendrochronology, see:

During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the scientific study of tree rings and the application of dendrochronology began. In 1859, the German-American [[Jacob Kuechler]] (1823–1893) used crossdating to examine [[oak]]s (''[[Quercus stellata]]'') in order to study the record of climate in western Texas.&lt;ref&gt;See:

(Both branches that are presented in plate 42, fig. 6 (with the cross-section in fig. 7) and fig. 1 (with the cross-section in fig. 2) had produced, in the defoliation year of 1862, a growth ring that was twice as strong as in the preceding one, and so was the ring of the year-old shoot (not illustrated here) stronger in the case of the defoliated tree than one that was not defoliated.)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1882, this observation was already appearing in forestry textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franklin B.

During the first half of the 20th century, the astronomer [[A. E. Douglass]] founded the [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]] at the [[University of Arizona]]. Douglass sought to better understand cycles of sunspot activity and reasoned that changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on earth, which would subsequently be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns (''i.e.'', sunspots → climate → tree rings).

[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of [[wood]] is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots, to form a growth ring.]]
Horizontal [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] cut through the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] can reveal growth rings, also referred to as ''tree rings'' or ''annual rings''. Growth rings result from new growth in the [[vascular cambium]], a layer of cells near the [[bark (botany)|bark]] that botanists classify as a [[lateral meristem]]; this growth in diameter is known as [[secondary growth]]. Visible rings result from the change in growth speed through the [[season]]s of the year; thus, critical for the title method, one ring generally marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. Removal of the bark of the tree in a particular area may cause deformation of the rings as the plant overgrows the scar.

The rings are more visible in trees which have grown in [[temperate zone]]s, where the seasons differ more markedly. The inner portion of a growth ring forms early in the growing season, when growth is comparatively rapid (hence the wood is less dense) and is known as "early wood" (or "spring wood", or "late-spring wood"&lt;ref&gt;"Early wood" is used in preference to "spring wood", as the latter term may not correspond to that time of year in climates where early wood is formed in the early summer (e.g. [[Canada]]) or in autumn, as in some [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] species.&lt;/ref&gt;); the outer portion is the "late wood" (sometimes termed "summer wood", often being produced in the summer, though sometimes in the autumn) and is denser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv |last= Capon |first= Brian|title= Botany for Gardeners |year= 2005 |pages= 66–67 |edition= 2nd |isbn= 0-88192-655-8 |publisher= Timber Publishing|location= Portland, OR}} {{better source|date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pinus taeda crossx7358.JPG|thumb|right|240px|''[[Pinus taeda]]'' Cross section showing annual rings, [[Cheraw, South Carolina]].]]
Many trees in temperate zones produce one growth-ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Hence, for the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern builds up that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring, while a drought year may result in a very narrow one.

Direct reading of tree ring chronologies is a complex science, for several reasons. First, contrary to the single-ring-per-year paradigm, alternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid-summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. In addition, particular tree-species may present "missing rings", and this influences the selection of trees for study of long time-spans. For instance, missing rings are rare in oak and [[elm]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;The only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]".{{cite web | url = http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | title= Useful Tree Species for Tree-Ring Dating | author= Lori Martinez | year= 1996 | publisher= | location= | accessdate= 2008-11-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108094321/http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | archivedate= 2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical to the science, trees from the same region tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period of chronological study. Researchers can compare and match these patterns  ring-for-ring with patterns from trees which have grown at the same time in the same geographical zone (and therefore under similar climatic conditions). When one can match these tree-ring patterns across successive trees in the same locale, in overlapping fashion, chronologies can be built up—both for entire geographical regions and for sub-regions. Moreover, wood from ancient structures with known chronologies can be matched to the tree-ring data (a technique called ''cross-dating''), and the age of the wood can thereby be determined precisely. Dendrochronologists originally carried out cross-dating by visual inspection; more recently, they have harnessed computers to do the task, applying statistical techniques to assess the matching. To eliminate individual variations in tree-ring growth, dendrochronologists take the smoothed average of the tree-ring widths of multiple tree-samples to build up a '''ring history''', a process termed replication. A tree-ring history whose beginning- and end-dates are not known is called a ''floating chronology''. It can be anchored by cross-matching a section against another chronology (tree-ring history) whose dates are known.

[[File:Annual growth of the wood (second typical form of the growth function).jpg|thumb|A typical form of the function of the wood ring (in accordance with the dendrochronological equation)  with an increase in the width of wood ring at initial stage.]]

Dendrochronological equation defines the law of growth of tree rings.
The equation was proposed by Russian biophysicist Alexandr N. Tetearing in his work "Theory of populations" &lt;ref name=Tetearing2012&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Alexandr N. Tetearing
 |title=Theory of populations |year=2012 |page=583 |isbn=978-1-365-56080-4 |publisher=SSO Foundation |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = \frac{1}{k_v\, \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}}} \, \frac{d\big(M^{\tfrac{1}{3}}(t)\big)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta L&lt;/math&gt; is width of annual ring, &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time (in years), &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density of wood, &lt;math&gt; k_v &lt;/math&gt; is some coefficient, &lt;math&gt; M(t) &lt;/math&gt; is function of mass growth of the tree.

With the neglection of natural sinusoidal oscillations in tree mass,
the formula of the changes in the annual ring width is:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = -\dfrac{ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t} }{3 k_v \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}} (c_4+ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t})^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

There &lt;math&gt; c_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_2 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c_4 &lt;/math&gt; are some coefficients, &lt;math&gt; a_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_2 &lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

The formula is useful for correct approximation of samples data before data normalization procedure.

The typical forms of the function &lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) &lt;/math&gt; of annual growth of wood ring are  shown in the figures.

== Sampling and dating ==
Dendrochronology makes available specimens of once-living material accurately dated to a specific year.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004&gt;{{cite book |author1=Renfrew Colin |author2=Bahn Paul |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=144–5 |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates are often represented as estimated calendar years [[before present|B.P.]], for before present, where "present" refers to 1 January 1950.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

Timber core samples are sampled and used to measure the width of annual growth rings; by taking samples from different sites within a particular region, researchers can build a comprehensive historical sequence. The techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity where the ring growth is more sensitive to the environment, rather than in humid areas where tree-ring growth is more uniform (complacent). In addition, some genera of trees are more suitable than others for this type of analysis. For instance, the [[bristlecone pine]] is exceptionally long-lived and slow growing, and has been used extensively for chronologies; still-living and dead specimens of this species provide tree-ring patterns going back thousands of years, in some regions more than 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |title=Bibliography of Dendrochronology |publisher=ETH Forest Snow and Landscape Research |location=Switzerland |accessdate=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804005355/http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}{{specify|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the maximum span for fully anchored chronology is a little over 11,000 years B.P.

In 2004 a new [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon calibration curve]], INTCAL04, was internationally ratified to provide calibrated dates back to 26,000 [[Before Present|B.P.]] For the period back to 12,400 B.P., the radiocarbon dates are calibrated against dendrochronological dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=PDF |title=INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon age calibration, 0–26 cal kyr BP |author1=Reimer Paula J |author2=Baillie Mike GL |author3=Bard Edouard |author4=Bayliss Alex |author5=Beck J Warren |author6=Bertrand Chanda JH |author7=Blackwell Paul G |author8=Buck Caitlin E |author9=Burr George S |author10=Cutler Kirsten B |author11=Damon Paul E |author12=Edwards R Lawrence |author13=Fairbanks Richard G |author14=Friedrich Michael |author15=Guilderson Thomas P |author16=Hogg Alan G |author17=Hughen Konrad |author18=Kromer Bernd |author19=McCormac Gerry |author20=Manning Sturt |author21=Ramsey Christopher Bronk |author22=Reimer Ron W |author23=Remmele Sabine |author24=Southon John R |author25=Stuiver Minze |author26=Talamo Sahra |author27=Taylor FW |author28=van der Plicht Johannes |author29=Weyhenmeyer Constanze E |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=1029–58 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/4167 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630151251/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/4167 |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fairbanks |first=Richard |title=Current Research: Radiocarbon Calibration |url=http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radiocarbon.htm |work=Columbia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825132650/http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radiocarbon.htm |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendrochronology practice faces many obstacles, including the existence of [[species]] of [[ant]]s that inhabit [[tree]]s and extend their galleries into the wood, thus destroying ring structure.

== Reference sequences ==
European chronologies derived from wooden structures initially found it difficult to bridge the gap in the 14th century when there was a building hiatus, which coincided with the [[Black Death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |isbn=978-0-7134-7654-5

 |location=London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there do exist unbroken chronologies dating back to prehistoric times, for example the Danish chronology dating back to 352 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |website=skalk.dk |title=WM Trædatering |language=da |trans-title=WM Tree dating |accessdate=15 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221121805/http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a sample of wood, the variation of the tree-ring growths provides not only a match by year, it can also match location because the climate across a continent is not consistent. This makes it possible to determine the source of ships as well as smaller artifacts made from wood but which were transported long distances, such as panels for paintings and ship timbers.

== Applications ==

=== Radiocarbon dating calibration ===
Dates from dendrochronology can be used as a [[calibration]] and check of [[radiocarbon dating]]&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

=== Climatology ===
{{Main|dendroclimatology}}

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s primarily from the properties of the annual tree rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/~sheppard/Raul/DendroclimatologyReview.pdf |title=Dendroclimatology: extracting climate from trees |first=Paul R. |last=Sheppard |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.]] |journal=WIREs Clim Change  |year=May-June 2010 |volume=1 |page=343-352 |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.

=== Art history ===
[[File:Mary Queen of Scots portrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, determined to date from the 16th century by dendrochronology.]]

Dendrochronology has become important to art historians in the dating of [[panel painting]]s. However, unlike analysis of samples from buildings, which are typically sent to a laboratory, wooden supports for paintings usually have to be measured in a museum conservation department, which places limitations on the techniques that can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf English Heritage Guide to Dendrochronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063338/http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to dating, dendrochronology can also provide information as to the source of the panel. Many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s have turned out to be painted on panels of "Baltic oak" shipped from the [[Vistula]] region via ports of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Oak panels were used in a number of northern countries such as England, France and Germany. Wooden supports other than oak were rarely used by Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk, Ron, ''More than Meets the Eye: An Introduction to Technical Examination of Early Netherlandish Paintings at the Fogg Art Museum'', Harvard University Art Museums Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 1, Autumn, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of seasoned wood were used, an uncertain number of years has to be allowed for seasoning when estimating dates.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ian Kuniholm, [http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf ''Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017230735/http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }} Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; Panels were trimmed of the outer rings, and often each panel only uses a small part of the [[radius]] of the trunk. Consequently, dating studies usually result in a "[[terminus post quem]]" (earliest possible) date, and a tentative date for the actual arrival of a seasoned raw panel using assumptions as to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. Stanley |last1=Taft |first2=James W. |last2=Mayer |first3=Richard |last3=Newman |first4=Peter Ian |last4=Kuniholm |first5=Dusan |last5=Stulik |title=The Science of Paintings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98722-4 |chapter=Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings |chapterurl=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/painttex.html |pages=206–215 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422142755/https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |archivedate=2017-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of establishing numerous sequences, it was possible to date 85–90% of the 250 paintings from the 14th to 17th century analysed between 1971 and 1982;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, John, ''Panel Examination and Dendrochronology'' The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Vol. 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; by now a much greater number have been analysed.

A portrait of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] was believed to be an 18th-century copy. However, dendrochronology revealed that the wood dated from the second half of the 16th century. It is now regarded as an original 16th-century painting by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots#dendro National Portrait gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017160354/http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dendrochronology was applied to four paintings depicting the same subject, that of [[Cleansing of the Temple|Christ expelling the money-lenders from the Temple]]. The results showed that the age of the wood was too late for any of them to have been painted by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 Tree Rings, the barcodes of Nature illuminate art history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043013/http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 |date=2013-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating oak panels, it is not effective in dating the poplar panels often used by Italian painters because of the erratic growth rings in poplar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology National Portrait Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017120656/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw a gradual replacement of wooden panels by canvas as the support for paintings, which means the technique is less often applicable to later paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty Conservation Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123200401/http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ |date=2013-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many panel paintings were transferred onto canvas or other supports during the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Building history ===
The dating of buildings with wooden structures and components has also been done by using dendrochronology. While archaeologists can date wood and when it was felled, it may be difficult to definitively determine the age of a building or structure in which the wood was used; the wood could have been reused from an older structure, may have been felled and left for many years before use, or could have been used to replace a damaged piece of wood. The dating of building via dendrochronology thus requires knowledge of the history of building technology.&lt;ref name=sawyer1993&gt;{{cite book |title= Medieval Scandinavia: from conversion to Reformation, circa 800–1500 |first1= Peter |last1= Sawyer |authorlink1= Peter Sawyer (historian) |first2= Birgit |last2= Sawyer |publisher= [[University of Minnesota Press]] |series= The Nordic Series |volume= 17 |year= 1993 |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-8166-1739-5 |oclc= 489584487 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518110748/https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate= 2015-05-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] in Dedham, Massachusetts. While the house had long been claimed to have been built circa 1640 (and being the oldest wood-framed house in North America), core samples of wood taken from a summer beam confirmed the wood was from an oak tree felled in 1637–8. An additional sample from another beam yielded a date of 1641, thus confirming the house had been constructed starting in 1638 and finished sometime after 1641 as wood was not seasoned before use in building at that time in New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Grand House in 17th-Century New England|url=http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|publisher=Fairbanks House Historical Site|accessdate=May 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316053504/http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Similar seasonal patterns also occur in [[ice core]]s and in [[varve]]s (layers of [[sediment]] deposition in a lake, river, or sea bed). The deposition pattern in the core will vary for a frozen-over lake versus an ice-free lake, and with the fineness of the sediment.

Some columnar [[cactus]] also exhibit similar seasonal patterns in the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in their spines ([[acanthochronology]]). These are used for dating in a manner similar to dendrochronology, and such techniques are used in combination with dendrochronology, to plug gaps and to extend the range of the seasonal data available to archaeologists and [[paleoclimatologist]]s.

A similar technique is used to [[Estimating the age of fish|estimate the age of fish]] stocks through the analysis of growth rings in the [[otolith]] bones.

A diazotroph is a [[microorganism]] that is able to grow without external sources of fixed nitrogen. Examples of organisms that do this are [[rhizobia]] and ''[[Frankia]]'' (in symbiosis) and ''[[Azospirillum]]''. All diazotrophs contain iron-molybdenum or -vanadium [[nitrogenase]] systems. Two of the most studied systems are those of ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]''. These systems are used because of their genetic tractability and their fast growth.&lt;ref name=DK94&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dixon R, Kahn D | title = Genetic regulation of biological nitrogen fixation | journal = Nature Reviews. Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = 621–31 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15263897 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word diazotroph is derived from the words ''diazo'' ("di" = two + "a" = without + "zoe" = life) meaning "dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)" and ''troph'' meaning "pertaining to food or nourishment", in summary dinitrogen utilizing. The word ''azote'' means nitrogen in French and was named by French chemist and biologist Antoine Lavoisier, who saw it as the part of air which cannot sustain life. &lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Diazotroph | title=Diazotroph - Biology-Online Dictionary &amp;#124; Biology-Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of diazotrophs==
Diazotrophs are scattered across [[bacterial|Bacteria]] taxonomic groups (as well as a couple of [[Archaea]]). Even within a species that can fix nitrogen there may be strains that do not fix nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; Fixation is shut off when other sources of nitrogen are available, and, for many species, when oxygen is at high partial pressure. Bacteria have different ways of dealing with the debilitating effects of oxygen on nitrogenases, listed below.

===Free-living diazotrophs===
* Anaerobes—these are obligate anaerobes that cannot tolerate oxygen even if they are not fixing nitrogen. They live in habitats low in oxygen, such as soils and decaying vegetable matter. ''[[Clostridium]]'' is an example. Sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in ocean sediments (e.g. ''[[Desulfovibrio]]''), and some Archean methanogens, like [[Methanococcus]], fix nitrogen in muds, animal intestines&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; and anoxic soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bae HS, Morrison E, Chanton JP, Ogram A | title = Methanogens Are Major Contributors to Nitrogen Fixation in Soils of the Florida Everglades | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 84 | issue = 7 | pages = e02222–17 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29374038 | pmc = 5861825 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02222-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facultative anaerobes—these species can grow either with or without oxygen, but they only fix nitrogen anaerobically. Often, they respire oxygen as rapidly as it is supplied, keeping the amount of free oxygen low. Examples include ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Paenibacillus polymyxa]]'', ''[[Bacillus macerans]]'', and ''[[Escherichia intermedia]]''.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* Aerobes—these species require oxygen to grow, yet their nitrogenase is still debilitated if exposed to oxygen. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'' is the most studied of these organisms. It uses very high respiration rates, and protective compounds, to prevent oxygen damage. Many other species also reduce the oxygen levels in this way, but with lower respiration rates and lower oxygen tolerance.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* Oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria ([[cyanobacteria]]) generate oxygen as a by-product of [[photosynthesis]], yet some are able to fix nitrogen as well. These are colonial bacteria that have specialized cells ([[heterocyst]]s) that lack the oxygen generating steps of photosynthesis. Examples are ''[[Anabaena cylindrica]]'' and ''[[Nostoc commune]]''. Other [[cyanobacteria]] lack heterocysts and can fix nitrogen only in low light and oxygen levels (e.g. ''[[Plectonema]]'').&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; Some cyanobacteria, including the highly abundant marine taxa ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' and ''[[Synechococcus]]'' do not fix nitrogen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zehr JP | title = Nitrogen fixation by marine cyanobacteria | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 162–73 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21227699 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2010.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, whilst other marine cyanobacteria, such as ''[[Trichodesmium]]'' and ''[[Cyanothece]]'', are  major contributors to oceanic nitrogen fixation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergman B, Sandh G, Lin S, Larsson J, Carpenter EJ | title = Trichodesmium--a widespread marine cyanobacterium with unusual nitrogen fixation properties | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 286–302 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 22928644 | pmc = 3655545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2012.00352.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria do not generate oxygen during photosynthesis, having only a single photosystem which cannot split water. Nitrogenase is expressed under nitrogen limitation. Normally, the expression is regulated via negative feedback from the produced ammonium ion but in the absence of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the product is not formed, and the by-product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; continues unabated [Biohydrogen]. Example species: ''Rhodobacter sphaeroides'', ''Rhodopseudomonas palustris'', ''Rhodobacter capsulatus''.&lt;ref name=Blankenship&gt;Blankenship RE, Madigan MT &amp; Bauer CE (1995). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Dordrecht, The Netherlands, Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbiotic diazotrophs===
* [[Rhizobia]]—these are the species that associate with legumes, plants of the [[Fabaceae]] family. Oxygen is bound to [[leghemoglobin]] in the root nodules that house the bacterial symbionts, and supplied at a rate that will not harm the [[nitrogenase]].&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* [[Frankia]]s—much less is known about these '[[actinorhizal]]' nitrogen fixers. The bacteria also infect the roots leading to the formation of nodules. Actinorhizal nodules consist of several lobes, each lobe has a similar structure as a lateral root. Frankia is able to colonize the cortical tissue of nodules where it fixes nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Vessey /&gt; Actinorhizal plants and Frankias also produce haemoglobins,&lt;ref name=Beckwith02&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckwith J, Tjepkema JD, Cashon RE, Schwintzer CR, Tisa LS | title = Hemoglobin in five genetically diverse Frankia strains | journal = Canadian Journal of Microbiology | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 1048–55 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12619816 | doi = 10.1139/w02-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but their role is less well established than for rhizobia.&lt;ref name=Vessey /&gt; Although at first it appeared that they inhabit sets of unrelated plants ([[alder]]s, [[Australian pine]]s, [[Ceanothus|California lilac]], [[bog myrtle]], [[Purshia|bitterbrush]], ''[[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]]''), revisions to the [[phylogeny]] of [[angiosperm]]s show a close relatedness of these species and the legumes.&lt;ref name=Soltis&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soltis DE, Soltis PS, Morgan DR, Swensen SM, Mullin BC, Dowd JM, Martin PG | title = Chloroplast gene sequence data suggest a single origin of the predisposition for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in angiosperms | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 2647–51 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7708699 | pmc = 42275 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.7.2647 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vessey&gt;{{cite journal |author = Vessey JK, Pawlowski, K and Bergman B |title=Root-based N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing symbioses: Legumes, actinorhizal plants, ''Parasponia'' sp and cycads |journal=Plant and Soil |year=2005 |volume=274 |issue=1–2 |pages=51–78 |doi= 10.1007/s11104-005-5881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These footnotes suggest the ontogeny of these replicates rather than the phylogeny. In other words, an ancient gene (from before the angiosperms and gymnosperms diverged) that is unused in most species was reawakened and reused in these species.
* [[Cyanobacteria]]—there are also symbiotic cyanobacteria. Some associate with [[fungi]] as [[lichen]]s, with [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, with a [[fern]], and with a [[cycad]].&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; These do not form nodules (indeed most of the plants do not have roots). Heterocysts exclude the oxygen, as discussed above. The fern association is important agriculturally: the water fern ''[[Azolla]]'' harbouring ''[[Anabaena]]'' is an important green manure for [[rice]] culture.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* Association with animals—although diazotrophs have been found in many animal guts, there is usually sufficient ammonia present to suppress nitrogen fixation.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; [[Termite]]s on a low nitrogen diet allow for some fixation, but the contribution to the termite's nitrogen supply is negligible. [[Shipworm]]s may be the only species that derive significant benefit from their gut symbionts.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;

==Importance==
In terms of generating nitrogen available to all organisms, the symbiotic associations greatly exceed the free-living species with the exception of cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=September 2014}}

'''Double tracking''' or '''doubling''' is an [[audio recording]] technique in which a performer sings or plays along with their own prerecorded performance, usually to produce a stronger or "bigger" sound than can be obtained with a single voice or instrument. It is a form of [[overdub]]bing; the distinction comes from the doubling of a part, as opposed to recording a different part to go with the first. The effect can be further enhanced by panning one of the performances hard left and the other hard right in the stereo field.

Artificial or [[automatic double tracking]], also known as ADT, was developed at [[Abbey Road Studios]] by engineers recording [[The Beatles]] in the 1960s. It used variable speed [[tape recorders]] connected in such a way as to mimic the effect created by double tracking. ADT produced a unique sound which could be imitated but not precisely duplicated by later [[analog delay|analog]] and [[digital delay]] devices, which are capable of producing an effect called [[doubling echo]]. The effect is used to give one singer a fuller sound. They would effectively [[Harmonization|harmonize]] with their own vocals, like a [[choir]] but with just one voice.

[[John Lennon]], who particularly enjoyed using the technique for his vocals while in the Beatles, also referred to his home-studio overdubbing technique as "double tracking", but this is not standard usage, since he recorded new parts. Lennon's post-Beatles albums frequently employed doubling echo on his vocals in place of the ADT. Some critics complained that the effect gave the impression that Lennon recorded all his vocals in a bathroom, but some performers, like [[Black Francis]] and [[Paul Simon]], value the rich [[echo chamber]] sound that it produces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Paul McCartney]] also commonly used this technique for his vocals while in the Beatles.

Due to the additional complexity of studying plasmas with charged dust particles, dusty plasmas are also known as '''complex plasmas'''.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;!-- This reference and page covers the entire paragraph. --&gt;

Dusty plasmas are encountered in:

* Industrial processing plasmas
* [[Astrophysical plasma|Space plasmas]]
* The [[mesosphere]] of the Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mps.mpg.de/de/projekte/sousy/sousy_result.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512191150/http://www.mps.mpg.de/de/projekte/sousy/sousy_result.html |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Specifically designed laboratory experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morfill |first=G. E. |title = Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field |journal = Reviews of Modern Physics |year = 2009 |volume = 81 |issue=4 |pages = 1353–1404 |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1353|bibcode = 2009RvMP...81.1353M |last2=Ivlev |first2=Alexei }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusty plasmas are interesting because the presence of particles significantly alters the [[charged particle equilibrium]] leading to different phenomena. It is a field of current research. Electrostatic coupling between the grains can vary over a wide range so that the states of the dusty plasma can change from weakly coupled (gaseous) to crystalline. Such plasmas are of interest as a non-[[Hamiltonian system]] of interacting particles and as a means to study generic fundamental physics of [[self-organization]], pattern formation, [[phase transition]]s, and [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]].

==Characteristics==

The '''temperature''' of dust in a plasma may be quite different from its environment. For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
|-
! Dust plasma component
! Temperature
|-
| Dust temperature
| align=right | 10 K
|-
| Molecular temperature
| align=right | 100 K
|-
| Ion temperature
| align=right | 1,000 K
|-
| Electron temperature
| align=right | 10,000 K
|}

The '''[[electric potential]]''' of dust particles is typically 1–10 V (positive or negative). The potential is usually negative because the electrons are more [[electron mobility|mobile]] than the ions. The physics is essentially that of a [[Langmuir probe]] that draws no net current, including formation of a [[Debye sheath]] with a thickness of a few times the [[Debye length]]. If the electrons charging the dust grains are relativistic, then the dust may charge to several kilovolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1979Ap&amp;SS..65....5M | title=Dust in cosmic plasma environments | journal=Astrophysics and Space Science | volume=65 | issue=1 | pages=5–12 | year=1979 | authors=Mendis, D. A. | doi=10.1007/bf00643484}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field electron emission]], which tends to reduce the negative potential, can be important due to the small size of the particles. The [[photoelectric effect]] and the impact of positive ions may actually result in a positive potential of the dust particles.

==Dynamics==
Interest in the dynamics of charged dust in plasmas was amplified by the detection of [[Rings of Saturn#Spokes|spokes]] in the rings of Saturn.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt; {{rp|85}} The motion of solid particles in a plasma follows the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d v}{dt} = \mathbf{F_{L}} + \mathbf{F_G} + \mathbf{F_P}  + \mathbf{F_D} + \mathbf{F_T}&lt;/math&gt;
where terms are for the Lorentz force, the gravitational forces, forces due to radiation pressure, the drag forces and the thermophoretic force respectively.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|70}}

The [[Lorentz force]], the contributions from the electric and magnetic force, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{L} = q \left ( \mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
where '''E''' is the electric field, '''v''' is the velocity and '''B''' is the magnetic field.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt; {{rp|71}}

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_g}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational forces]] acting on the dust particle, whether it be from planets, satellites or other particles&lt;ref name=IntroShukla&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=P. K.|last2=Mamun|first2=A. A.|title=Introduction to Dusty Plasma Physics|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7503-0653-9|pages=70–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5pAYrdQ9cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75,76}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_P}&lt;/math&gt; is the force contribution from radiation pressure. This is given as:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{P}= \frac{\pi r_d^2 }{c} I \mathbf{\hat{e_i}}&lt;/math&gt;
The direction of the force vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e_i}}&lt;/math&gt; is that of the incident radiation of photon flux &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The radius of the dust particle is &lt;math&gt;r_d&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|83}}

For the drag force there are two major components of interest, those from positive ions-dust particle interactions, and neutral-dust particle interactions.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|76}} Ion-dust interactions are further divided into three different interactions, through regular collisions, through Debye sheath modifications, and through [[coulomb collision]]s.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|77}}

The [[Thermophoresis#Thermophoretic force|thermophoretic force]] is the force that arises from the net temperature gradient that may be present in a plasma, and the subsequent pressure imbalance; causing more net momentum to be imparted from collisions from a specific direction.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|80}}

Then depending in the size of the particle, there are four categories:
#'''Very small particles''', where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_L}&lt;/math&gt; dominates over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_G}&lt;/math&gt; .
#'''Small grains''', where q/m ≈ {{radic|G}}, and plasma still plays a major role in the dynamics.
#'''Large grains''', where the electromagnetic term is negligible, and the particles are referred to as grains. Their motion is determined by gravity and viscosity.
#'''Large solid bodies'''. In centimeter and meter-sized bodies, viscosity may cause significant perturbations that can change an orbit. In kilometer-sized (or more) bodies, gravity and inertia dominate the motion.

==Laboratory Dusty plasmas==

Dusty plasmas are often studied in laboratory setups. The dust particles can be grown inside the plasma, or [[microparticles]] can be inserted. Usually, a [[low temperature plasma]] with a low degree of ionization is used. The microparticles then become the dominant component regarding the energy and momentum transport, and they can essentially be regarded as single-species system. This system can exist in all three classical [[phase (matter)|phases]], solid, liquid and gaseous, and can be used to study effects such as crystallization, wave and shock propagation, defect propagation, etc.

When particles of micrometer-size are used, it is possible to observe the individual particles. Their movement is slow enough to be able to be observed with ordinary cameras, and the kinetics of the system can be studied. However, for micrometer-sized particles, gravity is a dominant force that disturbs the system. Thus, experiments are sometimes performed under [[microgravity]] conditions during [[parabolic flight]]s or on board a [[space station]].

EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in [[Molar concentration|molar units]] (M), where 1&amp;nbsp;M is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Liter|L]].

The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of a ''graded'' [[dose response curve]] therefore represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of its maximal effect is observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-E/EC50.html EC50 definition]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of a ''quantal'' dose response curve represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of the population exhibit a response,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/190116.htm definition of EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for quantal dose response curve]&lt;/ref&gt; after a specified exposure duration.

It is also related to [[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] which is a measure of a compound's inhibition (50% inhibition).  For competition binding assays and functional antagonist assays [[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the most common summary measure of the dose-response curve.  For agonist/stimulator assays the most common summary measure is the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html Assay Operations for SAR Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129102848/http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html |date=2006-11-29 }} NIH Chemical Genomics Center&lt;/ref&gt; The half maximal effective concentration is sometimes also expressed as &lt;!-- pEC50 redirects here - the following term is bolded per MOS:BOLD --&gt;'''pEC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' instead of EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, where:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{pEC50} = -\log_{10} (\ce{EC50}) &lt;/math&gt;

A small change in [[ligand]] concentration typically results in rapid changes in response in the biological system, following a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]]al function. The [[inflection point]] at which the increase in response with increasing ligand concentration begins to slow is the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be mathematically determined by derivation of the best-fit line. While relying on a graph for estimation is more convenient, this typical method yields less accurate results and less precise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html Assay Operations for SAR Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129102848/http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html |date=2006-11-29 }} NIH Chemical Genomics Center&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
Many different equations can be used to derive an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. One possible function is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;Y = (\ce{Bottom}) + \frac\ce{(Top) - (Bottom)}{1 + \left(\frac\ce{X}\ce{EC50}\right)^{-(\text{Hill coefficient})} }&lt;/math&gt;

where Y is the observed value, Bottom is the lowest observed value, Top is the highest observed value, and the [[Hill coefficient]] gives the largest absolute value of the slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaplot.com/products/sigmaplot/Standard_Curves_Analysis.pdf EC50 equation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417121807/http://www.sigmaplot.com/products/sigmaplot/Standard_Curves_Analysis.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }} - see page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

The effects of a stressor or drug generally depend on the exposure time. Therefore, the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (and similar statistics) will be a function of exposure time. The exact shape of this time function will depend upon the stressor (e.g., the specific toxicant), its mechanism of action, the organism exposed, etc. This time dependency hampers the comparison of [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] or [[toxicity]] between compounds and between different organisms.

An early life stage (ELS) test is a chronic toxicity test using sensitive early life stages like embryos or larvae to predict the effects of toxicants on organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985"&gt;McKim JM. 1985. Early life stage toxicity tests. In Rand GM (1995). Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp 974–1010. {{ISBN|1-56032-091-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ELS tests were developed to be quicker and more cost-efficient than full life-cycle tests, taking on average 1–5 months to complete compared to 6–12 months for a life-cycle test. They are commonly used in [[aquatic toxicology]], particularly with fish. Growth and survival are the typically measured endpoints, for which a [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration]] (MATC) can be estimated. ELS tests allow for the testing of fish species that otherwise could not be studied due to length of life, spawning requirements, or size. ELS tests are used as part of environmental risk assessments by regulatory agencies including the [[EPA|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and [[Environment Canada]], as well as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name="EPAEEC"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/toera_analysis_eco.htm Technical Overview of Ecological Risk Assessment Analysis Phase: Ecological Effects Characterization.] US EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECDFELS"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 1992. Guideline 210: Fish early-life stage toxicity test. ''OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
ELS tests were adapted from full life-cycle toxicity tests, chronic tests that expose an organism to a contaminant for its entire life-cycle.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; These are widely considered to be the best tests for estimating long-term "safe" concentrations of toxicants in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The first full life-cycle tests on fish were developed for the [[fathead minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas''),&lt;ref name="Mount Stephan"&gt;Mount DI, Stephan CE. 1967. A method for establishing acceptable limits for fish-Malathion and the butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D. ''Trans Am Fish Soc'' 96:185-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit DA, Puglisi FA, Olson DL. 1982. A fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') early life stage toxicity test method evaluation and exposure to four organic chemicals. ''Environ Pollution Series A, Ecological and Biological'' 28:189-197.&lt;/ref&gt; and later for [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochirus''), [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis''), [[flagfish]] (''Jordanella floridae''), and [[sheepshead minnow]] (''Cyprinodon variegatus'').&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen DJ, Parrish PR, Schimmel SC, Goodman LR. 1978. Life-cycle toxicity test using sheepshead minnows (''Cyprinodon variegatus''). ''Bioassay Procedures for the Ocean Disposal Permit Program'', EPA-600/9-78-010.&lt;/ref&gt; While useful, full life-cycle tests require a high number of test organisms and extensive exposure time in the lab, especially for vertebrates.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Typically, life-cycle tests take 6–12 months for [[fathead minnow]] and 30 months for [[brook trout]].

Following the passage of the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) in the [[United States]] in 1976, there was an increased need for quicker, more efficient vertebrate toxicity tests.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The [[EPA]] was now required to assess the environmental effects of new chemicals before they could be commercially produced. Less costly and time-intensive tests were needed to evaluate a multitude of new chemicals. Researchers began developing toxicity tests that focused on early life stages, since these have been shown to be more sensitive to environmental stressors than later life stages.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Many critical events occur in a short period of time in the early stages of development.&lt;ref name="McKim 1977"&gt;McKim JM. 1977. Evaluation of tests with early life stages of fish for predicting long-term toxicity. ''J Fish Res Board Can'' 34:1148–1154.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stressor disrupts developmental events (including their timing), it could result in adverse effects that reduce the organism's chances of survival. Meta-analysis has found that early life-cycle portions of full life-cycle tests usually estimate an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] within a factor of 2 of full life-cycle estimates in saltwater and freshwater fish.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McKim 1977" /&gt; In 83% of 72 tests, the ELS portion resulted in the same [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] as the full life-cycle estimate, and the remaining 17% were within a factor of 2.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;

==Limitations==
There remain some limitations with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life cycle tests, they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds of fish and 1 to 5 months to complete.&lt;ref name="villeneuve"&gt;Villeneuve D, Volz DC, Embry MR, Ankley GT, Belanger SE, Léonard M, Schirmer K, Tanguay R, Truong L, Wehmas L. 2014. Investigating alternatives to the fish early-life stage test: a strategy for discovering and annotating adverse outcome pathways for early fish development. ''Environ Toxicol Chem'' 33:158-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues include the lack of mechanistic information, differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's [[mechanism of action]]. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATCs]] are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This could be due to the [[mode of action]] of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Additionally, growth response has been found to be an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]].&lt;ref&gt;Woltering DM. 1984. The growth response in fish chronic and early life stage toxicity tests: A critical review. ''Aquat Toxicol'' 5:1–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests.

==Methodology==
In a typical early life stage toxicity test, a flow-through dilutor system administers different concentrations of a toxicant to different test chambers.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; At least five different concentrations of a toxicant are tested, plus controls, with at least two exposure chambers for each treatment. The length of the exposure depends on the test species. For example, [[fathead minnow]] tests are 1–2 months long, while [[brook trout]] tests are around 5 months long. Growth and survival are the typical endpoints, for which an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] can be found.

Standard methods for ELS tests have been established by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]],&lt;ref name="OECDFELS" /&gt; [[ASTM International]],&lt;ref&gt;ASTM International.

==Current developments==
An extended ELS test has been examined as a potential surrogate for a fish full life-cycle test to detect weak environmental estrogens.&lt;ref name="panter"&gt;Panter GH, Hutchinson TH, Hurd KS, Bamforth J, Stanley RD, Duffell S, Hargreaves A, Gimeno S, Tyler CR. 2006. Development of chronic tests for endocrine active chemicals: Part 1. An extended fish early-life stage test for oestrogenic active chemicals in the fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') ''Aquat Toxicol'' 77:279-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) are ubiquitous in the environment, prompting the need for better screening assays to predict their effects, especially in aquatic species. Slightly longer ELS tests could be used instead of full life-cycle tests, taking into account sensitive windows of exposure like sexual differentiation and early gonadal development. Extended ELS tests have proven successful in detecting the effects of weak estrogens in [[fathead minnow]]s.&lt;ref name="panter" /&gt;

Additionally, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are being used to develop an alternative to FELS testing.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt; Industry and regulatory agencies are increasingly interested in an animal-free, cost-efficient surrogate.&lt;ref&gt;Knapen D, Vergauwen L, Verstraelen S, Dardenne F, Witters H, Blust R, Villeneuve DL, Ankley GT. 2013. Development of an alternative testing strategy for the fish early life-stage for predicting chronic toxicity." ''Toxicology Letters'' 221: S104.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are developing FELS-related AOPs to create a high-throughput, less costly screening strategy for toxicants that takes the [[mechanism of action]] into account.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt;

An '''epitome''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|əm|iː}}; {{lang-gr|ἐπιτομή}}, from ἐπιτέμνειν ''epitemnein'' meaning "to cut short") is a summary or miniature form, or an instance that represents a larger reality, also used as a [[synonym]] for embodiments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Epitomacy represents, "to the degree of." An [[abridgment]] differs from an epitome in that an abridgment is made of selected quotations of a larger work; no new writing is composed, as opposed to the epitome, which is an original summation of a work, at least in part.

Many documents from the [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds survive now only "in epitome", referring to the practice of some later authors (epitomators) who wrote distilled versions of larger works now lost. Some writers attempted to convey the stance and spirit of the original, while others added further details or anecdotes regarding the general subject. As with all secondary historical sources, a different [[bias]] not present in the original may creep in.

Documents surviving in epitome differ from those surviving only as fragments quoted in later works and those used as unacknowledged sources by later scholars, as they can stand as discrete documents but refracted through the views of another author.

Epitomes of a kind are still produced today when dealing with a corpus of literature, especially classical works often considered dense and unwieldy and unlikely to be read by the average person, to make them more accessible: some are more along the lines of abridgments, such as many which have been written of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon's]] ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', a work of eight large volumes (some 3600 pages), often published as one volume of about 1400 pages

Some are of the same type as the ancient epitome, such as various epitomes of the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' of [[St Thomas Aquinas]], originally written as an introductory textbook in theology, and now accessible to very few except for the learned in [[theology]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy]], such as ''A Summa of the Summa'' and ''A Shorter Summa''. Many epitomes today are published under the general title, "The Companion to...", such as ''The Oxford Companion to Aristotle'' or "An Overview of" or "guides", such as ''An Overview of the Thought of [[Immanuel Kant]]'', ''How to Read [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]'', or, in some cases, as an introduction, in the cases of ''An Introduction to [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'' or ''A [[Very Short Introduction]] to the [[New Testament]]'' (many philosophical "introductions" and "guides" share the epitomic form, unlike general "introductions" to a field).

==Examples of epitomes for lost works==
* [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius]] epitomes of [[Manetho]]'s ''[[Manetho#Aegyptiaca|Aegyptiaca]]''
* [[John Xiphilinus]]'s precis of the missing portions of [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History''
* [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]]'s abridged version of the ''Philippic History'' by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]], one of the main sources for the life of [[Alexander the Great]]
* The epitome of Book IV of the Pseudo-Apollodorus's ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' [''Library''], a comprehensive [[encyclopedia]] of [[Greek mythology]]

'''Ethnobiology''' is the [[Science|scientific study]] of the way living things are treated or used by different human cultures. It studies the [[System dynamics|dynamic relationships]] between people, [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and environments, from the distant past to the immediate present.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;[http://www.ethnobiology.org/education/whatis.html Society of Ethnobiology's "What is Ethnobiology" webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416233913/http://www.ethnobiology.org/education/whatis.html |date=2008-04-16 }}  Accessed 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"People-biota-environment" interactions around the world are documented and studied through time, across [[culture]]s, and across [[List of academic disciplines|disciplines]] in a search for [[Validity (logic)|valid]], [[Reliabilism|reliable]] answers to two 'defining' questions: "How and in what ways do human societies use nature, and how and in what ways do human societies view nature?"&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Brent (1992) Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings (15th century–19th century)===
[[File:WrightMolyneux-ChartoftheWorld-c1599.jpg|thumb|16th-century English map of the world showing extent of western geographic knowledge in 1599]]

Biologists have been interested in [[Traditional knowledge|local biological knowledge]] since the time [[Europe]]ans started [[European colonialism|colonising]] the world, from the 15th century onwards. Paul Sillitoe wrote that:&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt;

{{quote|Europeans not only sought to understand the new regions they intruded into but also were on the look-out for resources that they might profitably exploit, engaging in practices that today we should consider tantamount to [[biopiracy]]. Many new crops .. entered into Europe during this period, such as the potato, tomato, pumpkin, maize, and tobacco.&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt; (Page 121)}}

Local biological knowledge, collected and sampled over these early centuries significantly informed the early development of modern [[biology]]:&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt;
* during the 17th century [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] benefited from local biological knowledge in producing his catalogue, [[Rumphius#Herbarium Amboinense|''"Herbarium Amboinense"'']], covering more than 1,200 species of the plants in [[Indonesia]];
* during the 18th century, [[Carl Linnaeus]] relied upon Rumphius's work, and also corresponded with other people all around the world when developing the [[Scientific classification|biological classification]] scheme that now underlies the arrangement of much of the accumulated knowledge of the biological sciences.
* during the 19th century, [[Charles Darwin]], the 'father' of [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]], on his [[Charles Darwin#Journey of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]] took interest in the local biological knowledge of peoples he encountered.

===Phase I (1900s–1940s)===
Ethnobiology itself, as a distinctive practice, only emerged during the [[20th century]] as part of the records then being made about [[Other (philosophy)|other peoples]], and other cultures. As a practice, it was nearly always ancillary to other pursuits when documenting others' languages, [[folklore]], and natural resource use. Roy Ellen commented that:

{{quote|At its earliest and most rudimentary, this comprised listing the names and uses of plants and animals in native non-Western or 'traditional' populations often in the context of salvage ethnography ..[ie] ''ethno''-biology as the descriptive biological knowledge of 'primitive' peoples.&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"&gt;Ellen, Roy (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This 'first phase' in the development of ethnobiology as a practice has been described as still having an essentially [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] purpose, often focusing on identifying those 'native' plants, animals and technologies of some potential use and value within increasingly dominant [[Capitalism|western economic systems]]&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Examples of studies from this 'first' phase in the development of ethnobiology include Stevenson (1915), Castetter (1944) and Harrington (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase II (1950s–1970s)===
Arising out of practices in Phase I (above) came a 'second phase' in the development of 'ethnobiology', with researchers now striving to better document and better understand how other peoples' themselves "conceptualize and categorize" the natural world around them.&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt; In Sillitoe's words:

{{quote|By the mid-20th century .. utilitarian-focussed studies started to give way to more cognitively framed ones, notably studies that centred on elucidating classificatory schemes.&lt;ref name="SILL2006"&gt;Sillitoe, Paul (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; (Page 122)}}

[[File:Tawbuid men.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Some Mangyan (who count the Hanunóo among their members) men, on [[Mindoro]] island, [[Philippines]], where Harold Conklin did his ethnobiological work]]

This 'second' phase is marked:&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt;
* in [[Northern America]] (mid 1950s) with [[Harold Conklin]]'s completing his doctorate entitled ''"The relation of [[Hanuno'o language|Hanunóo]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213135409/http://www.mangyan.org/tribal/index.html#hanunoo] culture to the plant world"''&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, H.C. (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[Great Britain|Britain]] (mid 1960s) with the publication of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' book ''The Savage Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; legitimating "folk biological classification" as a worthy cross-cultural research endeavour
* in [[France]] (mid 1970s) with [[André-Georges Haudricourt]]'s [[Linguistics|linguistic]] studies of [[botanical nomenclature]]&lt;ref&gt;Haudricourt, Andre-Georges (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; and R. Porteres' and others work in economic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Porteres, R. (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present (1980s–2000s)===
By the turn of the 21st century ethnobiological practices, research, and findings have had a significant impact and influence across a number of fields of biological inquiry including [[ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;for instances of ethnobiology's influence on ecology, see Balée (1998); Plotkin (1995); Schultes &amp; von Reis (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; [[conservation biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for instances of ethnobiology's influence on conservation biology see Cunningham (2001); Johannes (1989); Laird (2002); Tuxill &amp; Nabhan (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; [[development studies]],&lt;ref&gt;for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on development studies, see Warren, Slikkerveer &amp; Brokensha (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[political ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on political ecology see Zerner (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of Ethnobiology advises on its web page:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ethnobiology is a rapidly growing field of research, gaining professional, student, and public interest .. internationally
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ethnobiology has come out from its place as an ancillary practice in the shadows of other core pursuits, to arise as a whole field of inquiry and research in its own right: taught within many tertiary institutions and educational programs around the world;&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt; with its own methods manuals,&lt;ref&gt;Ethnbiology methods manuals include Alexiades (1996) and Martin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; its own readers,&lt;ref&gt;one Ethnobiology reader is Minnis (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own textbooks&lt;ref&gt;one Ethnobiology textbook is Cotton (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of inquiry==

===Usage===
All societies make use of the biological world in which they are situated, but there are wide differences in use, informed by perceived need, available technology, and the culture's sense of morality and sustainability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ethnobiologists investigate what lifeforms are used for what purposes, the particular techniques of use, the reasons for these choices, and symbolic and spiritual implications of them.

===Taxonomy===
Different societies divide the living world up in different ways. Ethnobiologists attempt to record the words used in particular cultures for living things, from the most specific terms (analogous to species names in [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnean]] biology) to more general terms (such as 'tree' and even more generally 'plant'). They also try to understand the overall structure or hierarchy of the classification system (if there is one; there is ongoing debate as to whether there must always be an implied hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Roy (1993) pages 216 forward&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological, moral and spiritual significance===
Societies invest themselves and their world with meaning partly through their answers to questions like "how did the world happen?", "how and why did people come to be?", "what are proper practices, and why?", and "what realities exist beyond or behind our physical experience?" Understanding these elements of a societies' perspective is important to cultural research in general, and ethnobiologists investigate how a societies' view of the natural world informs and is informed by them.

===Traditional ecological knowledge===
In order to live effectively in a given place, a people needs to understand the particulars of their environment, and many traditional societies have complex and subtle understandings of the places in which they live.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ethnobiologists seek to share in these understandings, subject to ethical concerns regarding [[Indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]] and [[cultural appropriation]].

===Cross-cultural ethnobiology===
In cross cultural ethnobiology research, two or more communities participate simultaneously. This enables the researcher to compare how a bio-resource is used by different communities.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, F.M. and Narasimhan, D. (2012). ''Ethnobotany of the Kondh, Poraja, Gadaba and Bonda of the Koraput region of Odisha, India''. D.K. Printworld, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

===Ethnobotany===
{{main article|Ethnobotany}}

:Ethnobotany investigates the relationship between human societies and plants: how humans use plants – as food, technology, medicine, and in ritual contexts; how they view and understand them; and their symbolic and spiritual role in a culture.

===Ethnozoology===
{{main article|Ethnozoology}}
{{further information|Birds in culture|Insects in culture}}

:The subfield ethnozoology focuses on the relationship between animals and humans throughout human history. It studies human practices such as hunting, fishing and [[animal husbandry]] in space and time, and human perspectives about animals such as their place in the moral and spiritual realms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Ethnoecology===
{{main article|Ethnoecology}}

:Ethnoecology refers to an increasingly dominant 'ethnobiological' research [[paradigm]] focused, primarily, on documenting, describing, and understanding how other peoples perceive, manage, and use whole [[ecosystem]]s.

==Other disciplines==
Studies and writings within ethnobiology draw upon research from fields including [[archaeology]], [[geography]], [[linguistics]], [[systematics]], [[population biology]], [[ecology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnography]], [[pharmacology]], [[nutrition]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Ethics==
Through much of the history of ethnobiology, its practitioners were primarily from dominant cultures, and the benefit of their work often accrued to the dominant culture, with little control or benefit invested in the [[indigenous peoples]] whose practice and knowledge they recorded.

Just as many of those indigenous societies work to assert legitimate control over physical resources such as traditional lands or artistic and ritual objects, many work to assert legitimate control over their [[indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]].

In an age when the potential exists for large profits from the discovery of, for example, new food crops or medicinal plants, modern ethnobiologists must consider [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property rights,]] the need for informed consent, the potential for harm to informants, and their "debt to the societies in which they work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/committees/ethics/ethcode.htm Code of Ethics of the American Anthropological Association, section A]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, these questions must be considered not only in light of western industrialized nations' common understanding of ethics and law, but also in light of the ethical and legal standards of the societies from which the ethnobiologist draws information.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exequatur''' is a legal document issued by a sovereign authority that permits the exercise or enforcement of a right within the [[jurisdiction]] of the authority. The word is a form of the [[Latin]] verb "''exequi''", which denotes "let it be executed".

==International relations==
An exequatur is a [[letters patent|patent]] which a [[head of state]] issues to a foreign [[Consul (representative)|consul]], guaranteeing the consul's rights and privileges of office and ensuring recognition in the [[Sovereign state|state]] to which the consul is appointed to exercise such powers. If a consul is not appointed by [[Letters patent|commission]], the consul receives no exequatur; the government will usually provide some other means to recognize the consul. The exequatur may be withdrawn, but in practice, where a consul is obnoxious, an opportunity is afforded to his government to recall him.

==Catholic Canon law==
{{Main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
{{canon law}}
An exequatur is a legal instrument issued by secular authorities in [[Roman Catholic]] nations to guarantee the legal force of [[Papal]] doctrines have legal force within the jurisdiction of the secular authority. This custom began during the [[Western Schism]], when the legitimately elected [[Supreme Pontiff]] permitted secular leaders to verify the authenticity of Papal decrees before enforcing them.

Some dissidents in the Church claim, however, that the custom arose as an implication of the nature of secular authority over the Church and that such a state privilege to verify Papal doctrine was exercised since the early days of the Church.  However, Church doctrine denies that any permission from secular authority is necessary for Papal decrees to be legally effective, even though secular authorities sometimes do not enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05707a.htm|title=Exequatur|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In Brazilian, French, Luxembourg, Italian, Mexican, and Spanish law, an exequatur is a judgment of a tribunal (in the case of Italy, the Court of Appeal) that a decision issued by a foreign tribunal is to be executed in the jurisdiction of the former, thereby granting authority to the decision of the foreign tribunal as if it issued from the native tribunal.

In [[Puerto Rico]], an exequatur is a document that validates a [[court order]] of a [[United States]] [[civil court]] as if a court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico issued it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnuevodia.com/madreboricuaclamaporayudapararecuperarasuhijo-1830092.html ''Madre boricua clama por ayuda para recuperar a su hijo: El padre del menor amenaza con que no devolverá el pequeño que se encuentra en Nuevo México.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">'''Extinction threshold''' is a term used in [[conservation biology]] to explain the point at which a [[species]], [[population]] or [[metapopulation]], experiences an abrupt change in density or number because of an important parameter, such as habitat loss. It is at this critical value below which a species, population, or metapopulation, will go [[extinct]],&lt;ref name="ETMM"&gt;Ovaskainen, O. and Hanski, I. 2003:Extinction Threshold in Metapopulation Models, Ann.Zool.Fennic.40:81-97.&lt;/ref&gt; though this may take a long time for species just below the critical value, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R.

Extinction thresholds are important to conservation biologists when studying a species in a population or metapopulation context because the colonization rate must be larger than the extinction rate, otherwise the entire entity will go extinct once it reaches the threshold.&lt;ref name="PCB"&gt;Groom, M., Meffe, G. K., and Carroll, C.R. 2000:Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd Ed, Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction thresholds are realized under a number of circumstances and the point in modeling them is to define the conditions that lead a population to extinction.&lt;ref name="ETPFL"&gt;With, K.A. and King, A.W. 1999:Extinction Thresholds For Species in Fractal Landscapes, Conservation Biology: Vol 13, No.2,pp.314-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling extinction thresholds can explain the relationship between extinction threshold and [[habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref name="EHFET"&gt;Fahrig, Lenore. 2002:Effect of Habitat Fragmentation on the Extinction Threshold: A Synthesis, Ecological Applications: Vol.12, No.2, pp.346-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical models ==

Metapopulation-type models are used to predict extinction thresholds. The classic metapopulation model is the [[Levins Model]], which  is the model of metapopulation dynamics established by [[Richard Levins]] in the 1960s. It was used to evaluate patch occupancy in a large network of patches. This model was extended in the 1980s by [[Russell Lande]] to include habitat occupancy.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt; This mathematical model is used to infer the extinction values and important population densities. These mathematical models are primarily used to study extinction thresholds because of the difficulty in understanding extinction processes through empirical methods and the current lack of research on this subject.&lt;ref name="ETHPD"&gt;Deredec, A. and Courchamp,F, 2003:Extinction Thresholds in Host-Parasite Dynamics, Ann. Zool. Fennic. 40:115-130.&lt;/ref&gt; When determining an extinction threshold there are two types of models that can be used: deterministic and stochastic metapopulation models.

=== Deterministic ===

Deterministic metapopulation models assume that there are an infinite number of habitat patches available and predict that the metapopulation will go extinct only if the threshold is not met.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

'''''dp/dt = chp (1-p)-ep'''''

Where p= occupied patches, e= extinction rate, c= colonization rate, and h= amount of habitat.

A species will persist only if '''''h&gt; δ''''' 

where '''''δ=e/c''''' 

δ= species parameter, or how successful a species is in colonizing a patch.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

=== Stochastic ===

Stochastic metapopulation models take into account stochasticity, which is the non-deterministic or random processes in nature. With this approach a metapopulation may be above the threshold if determined that it is unlikely it will go extinct within a certain time period.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt; 

The complex nature of these models can result in a small metapopulation that is considered to be above the deterministic extinction threshold, but  in reality has a high risk of extinction .&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

== Other factors ==

When using metapopulation-type models to predict extinction thresholds there are a number of factors that can affect the results of a model. First, including more complicated models, rather than relying solely on the Levins model produces different dynamics. For example, in an article published in 2004, [[Otso Ovaskainen]] and [[Ilkka Hanski]] explained with an empirical example that when factors such as [[Allee effect]] or Rescue effect were included in modeling the extinction threshold, there were unexpected extinctions in a high number of species. A more complex model came up with different results, and in practicing conservation biology this can add more confusion to efforts to save a species from the extinction threshold. Transient dynamics, which are effects on the extinction threshold because of instability in either the metapopulation or environmental conditions, is also a large player in modeling results. Landscapes that have recently endured habitat loss and fragmentation may be less able to sustain a metapopulation than previously understood without considering transient dynamics.  Finally, environmental stochasticity, which may be spatially correlated, can lead to amplified regional stochastic fluctuations and therefore greatly affect the extinction risk.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

[[Dark fermentation]] reactions do not require light energy.  These are capable of constantly producing [[hydrogen]] from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Typically these reactions are coupled to the formation of carbon dioxide or formate.  Important reactions that result in hydrogen production start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exegonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

Using [[synthetic biology]], bacteria can be genetically altered to enhance this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163896478.html Synthetic biology and hydrogen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/19/chemistry.agriculture | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Chris | last=Edwards | title=Synthetic biology aims to solve energy conundrum | date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photofermentation]] differs from [[dark fermentation]], because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]]. [[Electrohydrogenesis]] is used in [[microbial fuel cell]]s.

==Bacteria strains==
For example photo-fermentation with ''[[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]]'' SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18477081 High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark-and photo-fermentation of sucrose]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterobacter aerogenes'' is an outstanding hydrogen producer. It is an anaerobic facultative and mesophilic bacterium that is able to consume different sugars and in contrast to cultivation of strict anaerobes, no special operation is required to remove all oxygen from the fermenter. ''E. aerogenes'' has a short doubling time and high hydrogen productivity and evolution rate. Furthermore, hydrogen production by this bacterium is not inhibited at high hydrogen partial pressures; however, its yield is lower compared to strict anaerobes like ''Clostridia''. A theoretical maximum of 4&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose can be produced by strict anaerobic bacteria. Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as ''E. aerogenes'' have a theoretical maximum yield of 2&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7329">Automatic '''fish counters''' are automatic devices for measuring the number of fish passing along a particular river in a particular period of time. Usually one particular species is of interest.

One important species studied by fish counters are [[Atlantic salmon]]. This species is of interest owing to its ecologically vulnerable status and [[Fish migration|anadromous]] lifestyles.

== Methods of operation ==

Fish counters can be divided into three principal types: resistive counters, optical counters, and hydroacoustic counters.

=== Resistive counters ===

A resistive counter is associated with an in-river structure, an example constituting a Crump weir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunt.de/networks/gunt/sites/s1/mmcontent/produktbilder/07016033/Datenblatt/07016033%202.pdf Crump weir]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[resistivity]] of a fish is lower than that of water. So, as fish cross this barrier, they pass embedded [[electrodes]], and the difference in resistivity disturbs the field established in the vicinity of the electrodes, altering inter-electrode resistance. With three electrodes these disturbances can then be measured by a [[Wheatstone bridge]], or other means, to detect the size and direction of travel of the fish.

Fish counters of this type are used widely in [[Scotland]] to census populations of Atlantic salmon, where comparison with closed circuit television shows around a 97% detection rate.

=== Optical counters ===

An [http://vaki.is/Products/RiverwatcherFishCounter/ optical counter] is also associated with an in-river structure. However, rather than pass electrodes, in an optical counter the fish interrupt some of a number of vertically arranged beams of light. The pattern of beam-breaks can be used to determine the size, profile, and direction of motion of the fish.

Infrared light is used for minimizing the disturbance of the fish as they will not see the light when passing through the counter. When a fish swims through the net of light beams, the resulting silhouette image is used for counting as well as estimating the size of each fish. Each individual image is memorized in the control unit so that the counting can be verified afterwards.

Some systems such as the [http://riverwatcher.is/ Riverwatcher] use the infrared scanner to trigger a digital camera to capture between 1 and 5 photos or a short video clip of each fish. The computer then automatically links the images to other information contained in the database for that individual fish such as size, passing hour, speed, silhouette image, temperature etc.

The camera is installed in a special tunnel that contains both the camera and lights providing constant light, and same distance from the camera for the fish. That way, it is possible to get good images of the fish regardless of time of day.

The performance of optical counters has been determined by studies, under various conditions, to be greater than 90%. Optical counters can also distinguish the size of fish more accurately than other counter types and so are particularly useful where a mixture of species inhabit a river (for example rivers where salmon mix with [[sea trout]]).

The key disadvantage of optical counters is the small penetration of the beams through the water, restricting their use to narrow river features or in-river structures, an example being fish ladders.

=== Hydroacoustic counters ===
Hydroacoustic counters operate using the principles of [[sonar]]. A fish is insonified by a sound source and reflections from the fish are detected by an underwater microphone. The reflection occurs because of the sudden change in impedance to sound waves within the fish, particularly at the [[swimbladder]] (90% of the reflection).

Hydroacoustic counters do not require in-river structures, but require skilled installation and operators. Without skilled installation at ideal sites hydroacoustic counters can be inaccurate. Studies typically indicate detection rates of 50% to 80%, though one study found detection rates as low as 3%. Careful planning and pre-siting study must be used to determine effectiveness.

The lack of a requirement for any in-river structure makes the counters an attractive proposition.  Generally used for short-term or seasonal studies, some situations require a long-term count which is accurate in absolute terms, not only in relative change (for example, no hydroacoustic sensors are routinely used in the detection of Scottish Atlantic salmon).  In these instances resistivity or optical sensors tend to be preferred.  Such methods usually require significant habitat modification, such as construction of a [[Fishing weir|weir]] to funnel the fish through the counter.

Recent advances in automated hydroacoustic monitoring systems has allowed continuous monitoring for periods exceeding 18 months.  These systems include intelligent monitoring and real-time data processing, ensuring proper operation and publication of status and results (e.g. fish counts) on a routine basis.

== Siting counters  ==

=== In river structures ===
Resistivity and (particularly) optical fish counters require in-river structures to direct the fish through the detection aperture of the counter. [[Fish ladder]]s and Borland fish passes are effective structures for this purpose and occasionally a natural restriction within the river may be used for a similar purpose. However, for most counters a custom in-river structure will be required. One of the most effective such structures is the Crump weir, a triangular profile weir designed to ensure rapid planar flow over the detector.

=== Siting within the river system ===
A species of anadromous fish, such as the Atlantic salmon, may return to a particular breeding ground throughout its life. This means that within the larger rivers a number of quite distinct populations may cross a counter together, in aggregate. A population which uses a particular tributary may collapse whilst the overall numbers are not clearly affected. Issues with the management of that particular tributary and population therefore go unnoticed. Counters should be placed to count individual populations, rather than the species in aggregate, in order that population collapses and recoveries can be detected.

== Alternative methods ==
The results of automatic fish counters can be supplemented, confirmed, or replaced by a number of alternative techniques, varying in accuracy, cost, complexity, and skew effects.

* [[Fish trap|Traps]]
* Net and rod counts
* [[Spawn (biology)#Spawn cycle|Redd]] counts (disturbances in gravel caused by mating activities of some fish)

A '''fuzzy associative matrix''' expresses [[fuzzy logic]] rules in tabular form. These rules usually take two variables as input, mapping cleanly to a two-dimensional matrix, although theoretically a matrix of any number of dimensions is possible.

Suppose a professional is tasked with writing fuzzy logic rules for a video game monster. In the game being built, entities have two variables: hit points (HP) and firepower (FP):

{|border=1
! HP/FP !! Very low HP !! Low HP !! Medium HP !! High HP !! Very high HP
|-
! Very weak FP
| Retreat! || Retreat! || Defend || Defend || Defend
|-
! Weak FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Defend || Attack || Attack
|-
! Medium FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack!
|-
! High FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack!
|-
! Very high FP
| Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack! || Full attack!
|}

This translates to:

 IF MonsterHP IS VeryLowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS LowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS MediumHP AND MonsterFP is VeryWeakFP THEN Defend

Multiple rules can fire at once, and often will, because the distinction between "very low" and "low" is fuzzy. If it is more "very low" than it is low, then the "very low" rule will generate a stronger response. The program will evaluate all the rules that fire and use an appropriate [[defuzzification]] method to generate its actual response.

An implementation of this system might use either the matrix or the explicit IF/THEN form. The matrix makes it easy to visualize the system, but it also makes it impossible to add a third variable just for one rule, so it is less flexible.

There is no inherent pattern in the matrix. It appears as if the rules were just made up, and indeed they were. This is both a strength and a weakness of fuzzy logic in general. It is often impractical or impossible to find an exact set of rules or formulae for dealing with a specific situation. For a sufficiently complex game, a mathematician would not be able to study the system and figure out a mathematically accurate set of rules. However, this weakness is intrinsic to the realities of the situation, not of fuzzy logic itself. The strength of the system is that even if one of the rules is wrong, even greatly wrong, other rules that are correct are likely to fire as well and they may compensate for the error.

This does not mean a fuzzy system should be sloppy. Depending on the system, it might get away with being sloppy, but it will underperform. While the rules are fairly arbitrary, they should be chosen carefully. If possible, an expert should decide on the rules, and the sets and rules should be tested vigorously and refined as needed. In this way, a fuzzy system is like an [[expert system]]. (Fuzzy logic is used in many true expert systems, as well.)

The aim of '''fuzzy transportation''' is to find the least transportation cost of some commodities through a [[capacitated network]] when the supply and demand of nodes and the capacity and cost of edges are represented as fuzzy numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Ghatee, M., Hashemi, S.M., Hashemi, B. and Dehghan, M., 2008.

Some concepts of the fuzzy multicommodity flow problem and their application in fuzzy network design. Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 49(5-6), pp.1030-1043.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is a new branch in [[combinatorial optimization]] and [[network flow problem]]s. Combinatorial algorithms can be provided to solve fuzzy transportation problem to find the fuzzy optimal flow(s). Such methods are capable of handling the decision maker's risk taking. Some application of such standpoint were presented in industries. Liu and Kao pursued this attempt to find better solution for this problem&lt;ref&gt;Liu, S.T. and Kao, C., 2004.

Optimal network design and storage management in petroleum distribution network under uncertainty. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 22(4-5), pp.796-807.&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory of this problem has been also presented in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ghatee, M., Hashemi, S.M., Hashemi, B. and Dehghan, M., 2008. The solution and duality of imprecise network problems. Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications, 55(12), pp.2767-2790.&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is interesting to check that which methods in traditional fuzzy optimization problem can be extended to combinatorial optimization problems e.g., transformation that they maintain the nice structure of problem. Then, valuable algorithms can be proposed for fuzzy combinatorial optimization to take the uncertainty of real problems into account.

By using fuzzy transportation, it is a reasonable attempt to find special solutions for hazardous material transportation because of the possibility of implementing the optimistic and pessimistic concepts into account. In &lt;ref&gt;http://norc.aut.ac.ir/are-we-ready-to-apply-fuzzy-optimization-in-transportation/&lt;/ref&gt; the application of fuzzy optimization for transportation studies has been discussed together with some references to the recent researches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21399">[[File:Heinrich Graetz.jpg|thumb|Heinrich Graetz, ca. 1885]]

'''Heinrich Graetz''' ({{IPA-de|ɡʁɛts|lang}}; 31 October 1817&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-the-Jews-Volume-Volume-6-Index/103369/29 "History of the Jews Volume 6" Page 5, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; – 7 September 1891) was amongst the first historians to write a comprehensive history of the [[Jew]]ish people from a Jewish perspective.

Born Tzvi Hirsh Graetz to a butcher family in Xions (now [[Książ Wielkopolski]]), [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now in [[Poland]]), he attended [[University of Wrocław|Breslau University]], but since Jews at that time were barred from receiving Ph.D.s there, he obtained his doctorate from the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2nd ed., vol. 8, sv. "Graetz, Heinrich"&lt;/ref&gt; After 1845 he was principal of the [[Jewish Orthodox]] school of the [[Wrocław|Breslau]] community, and later taught history at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). His [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''History of the Jews'' was quickly translated into other languages and ignited worldwide interest in [[Jewish history]]. In 1869 the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] (Wrocław) granted him the title of Honorary Professor. In 1888 he was appointed an Honorary Member of the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences]].

==Biography==
Graetz received his first instruction at [[Zerkov]], where his parents had relocated, and in 1831 was sent to [[Wolsztyn|Wolstein]], where he attended the [[yeshivah]] up to 1836, acquiring [[secular]] knowledge by private study. The "Neunzehn Briefe von Ben Uziel" (see [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]) made a powerful impression on him; and he resolved to prepare himself for academic studies in order to champion the cause of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. His first intention was to go to [[Prague]], to which place he was attracted by the fame of its old yeshivah and the facilities afforded by the university. Being rejected by the immigration officers, he returned to Zerkov and wrote to [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], then rabbi of Oldenburg, intimating his desire. Hirsch offered him a home in his house. Graetz arrived there on May 8, 1837, and spent three years with his patron as a pupil, companion, and amanuensis. In 1840 he accepted a tutorship with a family at [[Ostrów Wielkopolski|Ostrowo]], and in October 1842 he entered the University of Breslau.

At that time the controversy between Orthodoxy and [[Reform Judaism]] was at its height, and Graetz, true to the principles which he had imbibed from Hirsch, began his literary career by writing contributions to the "Orient," edited by [[Julius Fürst]], in which he severely criticized the Reform party, as well as Geiger's text-book of the [[Mishnah]] ("Orient," 1844). These contributions and his championship of the Conservative cause during the time of the rabbinical conferences made him popular with the Orthodox party. This was especially the case when he agitated for a vote of confidence to be given to [[Zecharias Frankel]] after he had left the [[Frankfurt]] conference because of the stand which the majority had taken on the question of the [[Hebrew language]]. After Graetz had obtained his degree of Ph.D. from the [[University of Jena]] (his dissertation being "De Auctoritate et Vi Quam Gnosis in Judaismum Habuerit," 1845; published a year later under the title "[[Gnosticism]]us und Judenthum"), he was made principal of a religious school founded by the Conservatives in Breslau. In the same year he was invited to preach a trial sermon before the congregation of [[Gliwice|Gleiwitz]], [[Silesia]], but failed completely.

He remained in Breslau until 1848, when, upon the advice of a friend, he went to Vienna, purposing to follow a journalistic career. On the way he stopped at [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]], where [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] was residing as Moravian chief rabbi. Hirsch, who then contemplated the establishment of a rabbinical seminary, employed Graetz temporarily as teacher at Nikolsburg, and afterward gave him a position as principal of the Jewish school in the neighboring city of Lundenburg (1850). In October 1850, Graetz married Marie Monasch, the daughter of the printer and publisher B. L. Monasch, of [[Krotoszyn|Krotoschin]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Memoirs of B. L. Monasch of Krotoschin", edited and translated by [[Peter Fraenkel (journalist)|Peter Fraenkel]]. ''Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook'' (1979) 24 (1): 195-223; here: p. 213. [[doi: 10.1093/leobaeck/24.1.195]].&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Hirsch's departure from Nikolsburg had an influence on Graetz's position; for in 1852 the latter left [[Lundenburg]] and went to Berlin, where he delivered a course of lectures on Jewish history before rabbinical students. They do not seem to have been successful. Meantime his advocacy of Frankel's course had brought him into close contact with the latter, for whose magazine he frequently wrote articles; and accordingly in 1854 he was appointed a member of the teaching staff of the seminary at Breslau, over which Frankel presided. In this position he remained up to his death, teaching history and Bible exegesis, with a preparatory course on the [[Talmud]]. In 1869 the government conferred upon him the title of professor, and thenceforward he lectured at Breslau University.

In 1872 Graetz went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the company of his friend [[Gottschalck Levy]] of [[Berlin]], for the purpose of studying the scenes of the earliest period of Jewish history, which he treated in volumes  one and two of his history, published in 1874-76; these volumes brought that great work to a close. While in Palestine, he gave the first impetus to the foundation of an orphan asylum there. He also took a great interest in the progress of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]], and participated as a delegate in the convention assembled at Paris in 1878 in the interest of the [[Romania]]n Jews. Graetz's name was prominently mentioned in the [[anti-Semitic]] controversy, especially after [[Heinrich von Treitschke|Treitschke]] had published his "Ein Wort über Unser Judenthum" (1879–1880), in which the latter, referring to the eleventh volume of the history, accused Graetz of hatred of [[Christianity]] and of bias against the [[German people]], quoting him as a proof that the Jews could never assimilate themselves to their surroundings.

[[File:Grobowiec-HeinrichGraetz.jpg|thumb|Graetz's tomb in the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Wrocław|Jewish Cemetery in Wrocław]]]]

This arraignment of Graetz had a decided effect upon the public. Even friends of the Jews, like [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], and advocates of Judaism within the Jewish fold expressed their condemnation of Graetz's passionate language. It was due to this comparative unpopularity that Graetz was not invited to join the commission created by the union of German Jewish congregations ([[Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund]]) for the promotion of the study of the history of the Jews of Germany (1885). On the other hand, his fame spread to foreign countries; and the promoters of the [[Anglo-Jewish Exhibition]] invited him in 1887 to open the Exhibition with a lecture. His seventieth birthday was the occasion for his friends and disciples to bear testimony to the universal esteem in which he was held among them; and a volume of scientific essays was published in his honor ("Jubelschrift zum 70. Geburtstage des Prof. Dr. H. Graetz," Breslau, 1887). A year later (27 October 1888) he was appointed an honorary member of the [[Spanish Academy]], to which, as a token of his gratitude, he dedicated the third edition of the eighth volume of his history.

As usual he spent the summer of 1891 in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]]; but alarming symptoms of heart disease forced him to discontinue his use of the waters. He went to Munich to visit his son [[Leo Graetz|Leo]], a professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|university of that city]], and died there after a brief illness. He was buried in Breslau. Besides Leo, Graetz left three sons and one daughter.

==Works==

===History of the Jews===
Graetz is chiefly known as the Jewish historian, although he did considerable work in the field of [[exegesis]] also. His ''Geschichte der Juden'' superseded all former works of its kind, notably that of [[Isaak Markus Jost|Jost]], in its day a very remarkable production; and it has been translated into many languages. The fourth volume, beginning with the period following the destruction of Jerusalem, was published first. It appeared in 1853; but the publication was not a financial success, and the publisher refused to continue it. However, the publication society [[Institut zur Förderung der Israelitischen Litteratur]], founded by [[Ludwig Philippson]], had just come into existence, and it undertook the publication of the subsequent volumes, beginning with the third, which covered the period from the death of [[Judas Maccabeus]] to the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. This was published in 1856 and was followed by the fifth, after which the volumes appeared in regular succession up to the eleventh, which was published in 1870 and brought the history down to 1848, with which year the author closed, not wishing to include living persons.

In spite of this reserve he gravely offended the Liberal party, which inferred, from articles that Graetz contributed to the ''Monatsschrift'', that he would show little sympathy for the Reform element, and therefore refused to publish the volume unless the manuscript was submitted for examination. This Graetz refused to do; and the volume therefore appeared without the support of the publication society. Volumes i. and ii. were published, as stated above, after Graetz had returned from Israel. These volumes, of which the second practically consisted of two, appeared in 1872-75, and completed the stupendous undertaking. For more popular purposes Graetz published later an abstract of his work under the title ''Volksthümliche Geschichte der Juden'', in which he brought the history down to his own time.

The fourth volume of the ''History of the Jews'' received a detailed review by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in a series of essays in Vols. II-IV (1855-8) of his monthly journal ''Jeschurun''. In these essays, a 203-page masterpiece of objective critique, Hirsch proves beyond doubt that Graetz is guilty of the utmost sloppiness of scholarship: e.g., Graetz omitted the second halves of quotations which, if quoted in their entirety, flatly contradict his thesis. Graetz claims, on the basis of one or two quotations from certain Talmudic sages, that they "were wont to do" something - despite sources explicitly to the contrary - and goes on to develop these suppositions into theories affecting the entire Torah tradition. Graetz fabricates dates, rearranges generations, speaks of "most of these laws" when in fact his description applies, even by a charitable interpretation, to fewer than half, and in many other ways rewrites the Talmud to support his theses and facilitate the flow of his history.

A translation into English was begun by [[S. Tuska]], who in 1867 published in [[Cincinnati]] a translation of part of vol. ix. under the title "Influence of Judaism on the [[Protestant Reformation]]". The fourth volume was translated by James K. Gutheim under the auspices of the American Jewish Publication Society, the title being "History of the Jews from the Down-fall of the [[Jewish State]] to the Conclusion of the Talmud" (New York, 1873).

A five-volume English edition was published in London in 1891-92 as ''History of the Jews from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (5 vols.; edited and in part translated by Bella Löwy).  According to a review in the January–April 1893 edition of ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', it "was passing through the press in its English version, and had received the author's final touches, when Graetz died in September 1891".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Quarterly Review |issue=January &amp; April 1893}}, reprinted in {{Cite journal|title=Littel's Living Age |issue=April–June 1893 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=geuPPcrxzykC&amp;pg=PA467#PPA451,M1 |volume=197 |author1=Littell, Eliakim |author2=Project, Making of America |author3=Littell, Robert S |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the Jordan Publishing Co. of New York published a two-volume "improved" edition, with a supplement of recent events by Dr. Max Raisin. Rabbi A. B. Rhine provided the English translation.

===Exegesis===
Graetz's historical studies, extending back to [[Biblical]] times, naturally led him into the field of [[exegesis]]. As early as the fifties he had written in the "Monatsschrift" essays dealing with exegetical subjects, as "Fälschungen in dem Texte der LXX." (1853) and "Die Grosse Versammlung: Keneset Hagedola " (1857); and with his translation of and commentaries on Ecclesiastes and Canticles (Breslau, 1871) he began the publication of separate exegetical works. A commentary and translation of the Psalms followed (ib. 1882-83). Toward the end of his life he planned an edition of the whole Hebrew Bible with his own [[textual emendation]]s. A prospectus of this work appeared in 1891. Shortly before the author's death, a part of it, [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]], was issued in the form in which the author had intended to publish it; the rest contained only the textual notes, not the text itself. It was edited, under the title "Emendationes in Plerosque Sacræ Scripturæ Veteris Testamenti Libros," by W. Bacher (Breslau, 1892–94).

The most characteristic features of Graetz's exegesis are his bold textual emendations, which often substitute something conjectural for the [[Masoretic]] text, although he always carefully consulted the ancient versions. He also determined with too much certainty the period of a Biblical book or a certain passage, when at best there could only be a probable hypothesis. Thus his hypothesis of the origin of [[Ecclesiastes]] at the time of [[Herod the Great]], while brilliant in its presentation, is hardly tenable. His textual emendations display fine tact, and of late they have become more and more respected and adopted.

===Other literary work===
Graetz's activity was not limited to his special field. He enriched other branches of Jewish science, and wrote here and there on general literature or on questions of the day. To the field of general literature belongs also his essay on "[[Shylock]]," published in the ''Monatsschrift'', 1880. In the early years of the anti-Semitic movement he wrote, besides the articles in which he defended himself against the accusations of Treitschke, an anonymous essay entitled "Briefwechsel einer Englischen Dame über Judenthum und Semitismus," Stuttgart, 1883. To supplement his lectures on Jewish literature he published an anthology of neo-Hebraic poetry under the title "Leḳeṭ Shoshannim" (Breslau, 1862), in which he committed the mistake of reading the verses of a poem horizontally instead of vertically, which mistake Geiger mercilessly criticized (''Jüdische Zeitschrift für Wissenschaft und Leben'', 1, p.&amp;nbsp;68-75). A very meritorious work was his edition of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] in one volume (Krotoschin, 1866). A bibliography of his works has been given by [[Israel Abrahams]] in ''The [[Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' (4, p.&amp;nbsp;194-203).

====The Kompert Affair====
Graetz's essay "Die Verjüngung des jüdischen Stammes," in Wertheimer-Kompert's ''Jahrbuch für Israeliten'', vol. x., Vienna, 1863 (reprinted with comments by Th. Zlocisti, in ''Jüdischer Volks-Kalender'', p.&amp;nbsp;99, Brünn, 1903), caused a suit to be brought against him by the clerical anti-Semite [[Sebastian Brunner]] for libeling the Jewish religion. As Graetz was not an [[Austria]]n subject, the suit was nominally brought against [[Leopold Kompert]] as editor, and the latter was fined (30 December 1863).

Graetz had interpreted [[Isaiah]] chapters 52 and 53 to refer not to the personal [[Messiah]], but rather to the entire people Israel. Graetz and Kompert were brought to court in Vienna for publishing ideas that were heretical to the Catholic faith, in addition to contradicting Jewish tradition. Viennese rabbis [[Isaak Noah Mannheimer]] and [[Lazar Horowitz]] defended Graetz, and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]] criticized them for doing so; [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]] published a pamphlet entitled ''Neẓaḥ Yisrael'' in support of their testimony.

This case, known as the "Kompert Affair," was important in defining the wedge between [[Orthodox Judaism]] and the nascent [[Conservative Judaism]] championed by the likes of Graetz and [[Zecharias Frankel]]. Thus, within the Jewish fold the lawsuit also had its consequences, as the Orthodox raised against Graetz the accusation of heresy because he had denied the personal character of the prophetic [[Messiah]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Legacy==
Graetz's history became very popular and influential in its time. The material for Jewish history being so varied, the sources so scattered in the literatures of all nations, and the chronological sequence so often interrupted, made the presentation of this history as a whole a very difficult undertaking; and it can not be denied that Graetz performed his task with consummate skill, that he mastered most of the details while not losing sight of the whole. Another reason for the popularity of the work is its sympathetic treatment. This history of the Jews is not written by a cool observer, but by a warm-hearted Jew. On the other hand, some of these commendable features are at the same time shortcomings. {{according to whom|date=April 2017}}

Some characterize Graetz's main elements of Jewish experience through the ages to be 'suffering and spiritual scholarship', while later Jewish scholarly works like [[Salo W. Baron]]'s 1937 ''A Social and Religious History of the Jews'', opposed the view of Jewish history as being 'all darkness and no light' and sought to restore balance, by writing a social history.  Baron strove to integrate the religious dimension of Jewish history into a full picture of Jewish life and to integrate the history of Jews into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived.   Baron brought very distinctive views to his scholarship. He inveighed against what he termed the "lachrymose conception of Jewish history," sometimes identified with Heinrich Graetz. In a 1975 interview Baron said: "Suffering is part of the destiny [of the Jews], but so is repeated joy as well as ultimate redemption." According to [[Arthur Hertzberg]], Baron was writing social history, insisting that spiritual creativity and the political situation were all borne by a living society and its changing forms,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEED91630F935A15752C1A96F948260 Salo W.

The '''Human Terrain System''' ('''HTS''') was a [[United States Army]], [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)]] support program employing personnel from the social science disciplines – such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], regional studies, and [[linguistics]] – to provide military commanders and staff with an understanding of the local population (i.e. the "human terrain") in the regions in which they are deployed.&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|authorlink=Maximilian Forte|title=The Human Terrain System and Anthropology: A Review of Ongoing Public Debates|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2011|volume=113|issue=1|pages=149–153|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

The concept of HTS was first developed in a paper by [[Montgomery McFate]] and Andrea Jackson in 2005,&lt;ref name=McFate&amp;Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Andrea Jackson|title=An Organizational Solution for DODs Cultural Knowledge Needs|journal=Military Review|date=July–August 2005|pages=18–21|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/mcfate2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed a pilot version of the project as a response to "identified gaps in [US military] commanders' and staffs' understanding of the local population and culture", such as became particularly visible during the US invasion of [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Steve Fondacaro|title=Reflections on the Human Terrain System During the First Four Years|journal=Prism|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/reflections-human-terrain-system.html|publisher=NDU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;  HTS was subsequently launched as a [[proof-of-concept]] program, run by the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC), in February 2007, with five HTS teams deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; Since 2007, HTS has grown from a program with five deployed teams and a $20 million two-year budget to one with 31 deployed teams and a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; HTS became a permanent US Army program in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

Ever since its launch, HTS has been surrounded by controversy.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fattahi|first=Kambiz|title=US Army enlists anthropologists|publisher=BBC News|date= 16 October 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/americas/7042090.stm|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schactman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title='Human Terrain' Chief Ousted|publisher=Wired|date=15 June 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/human-terrain-chief-ousted/#more-26041|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the program initially received positive coverage in the US media, it quickly became the subject of heavy criticism – particularly from anthropologists, but also from journalists, military officials and HTS personnel and former personnel.&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; Most notably, on 31 October 2007, the Executive Board of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise" that conflicted with the AAA's Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf American Anthropological Association’s Executive Board Statement on the Human Terrain System Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101015936/http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }} American Anthropological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAstatement&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=Statement on HTS|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/statement-on-HTS.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; Following the publication of a report on HTS by the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) in 2009,&lt;ref name=Glenn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenn|first=David|title=Program to Embed Anthropologists with Military Lacks Ethical Standards, Report says|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=3 December 2009|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Program-to-Embed/49344/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Panel Criticizes Military's Use of Embedded Anthropologists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/04anthro.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AAA released a further statement of disapproval, which they re-iterated in 2012 after rumours that the controversy had died down.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name=C41SR&gt;{{cite news|last=Albro|first=Robert|title=Comment: Do No Harm|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR02/304250001/Commentary-8216-Do-no-harm-8217-?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell|accessdate=16 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=April 2012|author2= Gusterson, Hugh|agency=Defense News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program evolved into a mechanism for supporting security force assistance. The program ended operations on September 30, 2014.

==Background==
In the most immediate sense, HTS was developed as a response to concerns about mismanagement of US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in particular, to the negative effects of recognized "deficiencies" in US military "cultural understanding" of these countries. In 2006 the Human Terrain System was launched by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Roberto|title=Human Terrain: Past, Present and Future Applications|journal=Anthropology Today|date=February 2008|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–26|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2008.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fawcett&gt;{{cite web|last=Fawcett|first=Grant S.|title=Cultural Understanding in Counterinsurgency: Analysis of the Human Terrain System|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA505497|publisher=Army Command and General Staff Coll Fort Leavenworth KS School of Advanced Military Studies|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, military analysts and academics have also suggested earlier historical contexts for the program's development.

===CORDS: a US military precedent===
A number of military officials have invoked [[Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) – a counterinsurgency program developed by the US military during the [[Vietnam war]] – as a precedent for HTS.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilon|first=Juliana Geran|title=Cultural Intelligence for Winning the Peace|year=2009|publisher=[[The Institute of World Politics]] Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9824888-0-7|pages=|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}}&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Carol|title=Military Culture and Education|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409407577|pages=29–38 [32]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=56HiId0a84QC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=CORDS+vietnam+Human+Terrain+system+military#v=onepage&amp;q=CORDS%20vietnam%20Human%20Terrain%20system%20military&amp;f=false|editor=Douglass Higbee|accessdate=21 June 2012|chapter=Combat Ethnography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a foundational article on HTS, a group of military analysts, Kipp ''et al'', described the program as "a CORDS for the 21st Century".&lt;ref name=Kipp&gt;{{cite web|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA457490|publisher=Defense Technology Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=18 June 2012|author2=Lester Grau |author3=Karl Prinslow |author4=Don Smith |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KippB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century (full document)|journal=Military Review|date=September–October 2006|pages=8–15|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA457490|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|volume=4|issue=11|date=September–October 2006|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their article appraised CORDS as a successful and effective program that was "premised on a belief that the war would ultimately be won or lost not on the battlefield, but in the struggle for the loyalty of the people". Kipp ''et al'' contended that the only major problems with the CORDS program were that it lacked adequate [[Reachback#Defense usage|reachback]] facilities and that it "was started too late and ended too soon".  As such, they argued that it provided "many important lessons" to "guide" the development of HTS as an "effective cultural intelligence program" that could "support tactical and operational-level commanders today".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} By contrast, critics of HTS have drawn attention to the fact that, in Vietnam, CORDS was run in conjunction with the [[Phoenix Program]], which used information gathered through CORDS in its effort to "neutralize" (by means of assassination, infiltration and capture) supporters of the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalesInterview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency, Anthropology and Disciplinary Complicity|journal=Counterpunch|date=3 February 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/02/03/counterinsurgency-anthropology-and-disciplinary-complicity/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the concept of "human terrain"===
The concept of "human terrain" has been defined in military documents pertaining to HTS as "the human population in the operational environment ... as defined and characterized by sociocultural, anthropologic and ethnographic data and other non-geographical information".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|15}} According to Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]], and one of the most vocal critics of HTS), this concept can be traced back to a 1968 report by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) about "the perceived threat of the [[Black Panthers]] and other militant groups".&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt; He argues that the concept gradually gained in popularity and usage, in the military and elsewhere, through the writing of military officials, such as [[Ralph Peters]], and pundits, such as [[Max Boot]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

===History of anthropological engagement with the military===
Commentators on HTS have also drawn attention to the long history of anthropological involvement in military operations in the US and Europe, though for different reasons.  In a 2005 article, [[Montgomery McFate]] (HTS's Senior Social Scientist from 2007 to 2010, and an anthropologist by training) argued that anthropology was born as a "warfighting discipline", having served in its early history as "the handmaiden of colonialism".&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|title=Anthropology and counterinsurgency: the strange history of their curious relationship|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2005|url=http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813124239/http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that anthropology had retreated "into the Ivory Tower" following the Vietnam war, and contended that anthropologists should become involved in developing "military applications of cultural knowledge". [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of anthropology and sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) also noted that anthropology and warfare have "merged" many times before, but argued that the difference with HTS was that the program had been "clearly identified" as involving activities that betrayed "basic ethical standards for protecting the interests and well-being of studied populations".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain Systems, Anthropologists and the War in Afghanistan|journal=Counterpunch|date=1 December 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/12/01/human-terrain-systems-anthropologists-and-the-war-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil L Whitehead]] (Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]) likewise argued that the "collaboration" between anthropological theory and colonial practice was "nothing new", but went on to suggest that this history – and particularly recent developments such as HTS and the [[Minerva Initiative]] – should prompt a critical re-assessment and transformation of anthropological methodology.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|title=Ethnography, Torture and the Human Terrain / Terror Systems|journal=Fast Capitalism|year=2009|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/5_2/Whitehead5_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "cultural turn" in the US Army===
A number of commentators on HTS have described the program as part of a "[[cultural turn]]" in US military policy, particularly pertaining to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Derek|title=The Rush to the Intimate: Counterinsurgency and the Cultural Turn|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=July–August 2008|volume=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jager&gt;{{cite book|last=Jager|first=Sheila Miyoshi| authorlink = Sheila Miyoshi Jager| title=On the Uses of Cultural Knowledge|year=2007|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute|location=Washington|isbn=1-58487-330-2|pages=v|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub817.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Jonathon|title=A kinder, gentler counter-terrorism: counter-insurgency, human security and the War on Terror|journal=Security Dialogue|date=February 2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=25–26|doi=10.1177/0967010610393390|url=http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/42/1/21.abstract|publisher=Sage|format=([[PDF]]), Restricted Access.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gusterson2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Anthropology and Global Counterinsurgency|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-42994-6|pages=279–298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=du5kcfUuL9oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=cultural+turn+in+the+u+s+army#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20turn%20in%20the%20war%20on%20terror&amp;f=false|editor=John Kelly|chapter=The Cultural Turn in the War on Terror|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zehfuss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehfuss|first=Maja|title=Culturally sensitive war?

== History and recent developments ==

===Chronological history of developments in HTS===
The beginnings of HTS can be traced to a pilot proposal for a "Pentagon Office of Operational Cultural Knowledge", published in 2005 by Montgomery McFate and Andrea Jackson.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2005, the [[Foreign Military Studies Office]] (FMSO) initiated an HTS pilot project (named Cultural Operations Research – Human Terrain System, or COR-HTS), which was headed up by Captain Don Smith, and housed at the Training and Doctrine Command in [[Fort Leavenworth]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  The pilot lasted until August 2006.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2006, [[Colonel]] Steve Fondacaro (retired) was hired by TRADOC to transition the pilot into an active program.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;  In October 2006, Jacob Kipp and colleagues outlined the Human Terrain System in an official FMSO public press release.&lt;ref name=Kipp /&gt;

HTS began recruiting in early 2007.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In February 2007, the first team was deployed to Afghanistan. Further teams were deployed to Iraq in the summer of that year.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  Originally, HTS project leaders McFate and Fondacaro had planned for the program to run at a small scale (five teams: two in Afghanistan, three in Iraq) for two years.&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;  However, in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from Central Command issued in April 2007, calling for an HTS Team in every Army Brigade and Marine Corps Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;CENTCOM JUONS dated 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Defense Secretary]], [[Robert M. Gates]], authorized a $40 million expansion of the program in September 2007.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Adam, "Odyssey Took Man From Campus to Combat", ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' ([[Associated Press]]), 8 March 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The JUONS demanded a 420 per cent expansion of HTS, from the existing five teams to twenty-six teams divided between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; McFate and Fondacaro referred to this as a "catastrophic success", meaning that "while the boost from the DOD ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) was gratifying, fulfilling the mandate would stretch a new organization to the limit".&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;

Following the public statement of disapproval from the AAA, and significant media coverage of the controversy surrounding HTS, the [[United States Congress]] issued an order for an independent assessment of HTS to be undertaken by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in September 2009.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; In May 2010, the [[House Armed Services Committee]] (HASC) temporarily limited the Army's funding obligation towards the program while this assessment was completed. The CNA report, which contained the results of interviews with 19 out of 71 commanders supported by HTS,&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA /&gt; was completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=CNAR&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Yvette|title=Congressionally Directed Assessment of the Human Terrain System|url=http://openanthropology.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/gettrdoc.pdf|publisher=CNA|accessdate=20 June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently published on the [[Defense Technical Information Center]] (DTIC) website in February 2011, but withdrawn from the website shortly after.&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon|title=Retracted Center for Naval Analyses Assessment of Human Terrain System|publisher=Public Intelligence|date=7 March 2011|url=http://publicintelligence.net/retracted-center-for-naval-analyses-assessment-of-the-human-terrain-system|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, HTS was approved by the US Army and became a permanent Army program.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; In June 2010, [[Maxie McFarland]], the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence at TRADOC, terminated Fondacaro's temporary position as HTS Program Manager.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberger2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title='Human Terrain' hits rocky ground|journal=Nature|date=22 June 2010|volume=465|issue=993|doi=10.1038/465993a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100622/full/465993a.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|pages=993|pmid=20577178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonel Sharon Hamilton was appointed as his replacement. McFate also left HTS in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

On 8 March 2011, the Center for Complex Operations at the [[National Defense University]] hosted a conference titled Inter-agency Human Terrain Program and Requirements.&lt;ref name=CCO&gt;{{cite web|last=Centre for Complex Operations|title=CCO Event: Interagency Human Terrain Programs and Requirements|date=8 March 2011|url=http://ccoportal.org/event/2011/cco-event-interagency-human-terrain-programs-and-requirements|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center stated that the aims of the conference were to "improve understanding of human terrain information and analysis and of how it is currently being used"; to discuss the "effectiveness" of HTS; and to discuss ethical and legal issues associated with the program.&lt;ref name=CCO /&gt; In June 2011, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] requested and launched a pilot HTS program.&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Army HQ|journal=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin|title=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin: Human Terrain System|date=October–December 2011|volume=37|issue=4|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2011_04.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2012|publisher=US Army Military Intelligence Center of Excellence|id=PB 34-11-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2011, Colonel Hamilton reported that the US Central Command had issued a requirement for an increase of 9 HTS teams in Afghanistan by summer 2012, to bring the total number of teams in Afghanistan up to 31.&lt;ref name=Bertuca&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertuca|first=Tony|title=Army increasing number of Human Terrain Teams; advising allies|url=http://defensenewsstand.com/NewsStand-General/The-INSIDER-Free-Article/army-increasing-number-of-human-terrain-teams-advising-allies/menu-id-720.html|publisher=Inside Washington Publishers|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, HTS officials began prioritizing HTS involvement in "Phase Zero" or, in other words, the earliest, "prevention of conflict" stage of a military campaign.&lt;ref name=McFate2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{cite news|last=Hodges|first=Jim|title=Cover Story: US Army's Human Terrain Experts May Help Defuse Future Conflicts|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120322/C4ISR02/303220015/Cover-Story-U-S-Army-8217-s-Human-Terrain-Experts-May-Help-Defuse-Future-Conflicts|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, ''Defense News'' reported that the Director of HTS, Colonel Sharon Hamilton, had been "working on a plan" to expand the use of HTS into other regions such as Africa and Latin America, and was considering whether HTS personnel could be deployed in Mexico to support military counter-narcotic work.&lt;ref name=DNanti-drug&gt;{{cite news|last=Iannotta|first=Ben|title=New tool eyed by U.S. for anti-drug war|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR01/304250006/New-tool-eyed-by-U-S-anti-drug-war|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Defense News|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schactman 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Que Curioso!

As part of the ongoing drawdown from Afghanistan in 2013–2014, the Army programmed HTS funding to drop proportionately, eliminating human terrain teams as units were removed from [[Theater (warfare)|theater]]. By September 2014, all HTS teams and personnel had been withdrawn from Afghanistan. Contract and personnel support to the program ceased at the end of the month, effectively ending the program's operations as of 1 October 2014. However, money was still allocated for the program in FY 2015.

===Notable operations===

====Operation Khyber====
During a 15-day operation in the late summer of 2007, 500 [[Afghan army|Afghan]] and 500 US soldiers were deployed to clear an estimated 200 to 250 Taliban insurgents out of [[Paktia Province]], secure southeastern Afghanistan's most important road, and halt a string of [[suicide attacks]] on US troops and local governors. During the operation, an HTS anthropologist, Tracy St. Benoit,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} identified an unusually high concentration of widows in poverty, creating pressure on their sons to join the well-paid insurgents.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Scott|title=US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=7 September 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing St. Benoit's advice, US officers developed a job training program for the widows.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; She also interpreted the beheading of a local tribal elder as an effort to divide and weaken the [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], rather than as a more general attempt at intimidation. As a result, Afghan and US officials focused on uniting the Zadran, one of southeastern Afghanistan's most powerful [[tribe]]s, as a way of hindering the Taliban's operations in the area.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

====Operation Maiwand====
800 Afghan soldiers, 400 US soldiers and 200 Afghan policemen took part in Operation Maiwand, in which Afghan soldiers raided houses of suspected militants.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''International Herald Tribune'', [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php Afghan army plans, executes first big operation, taking step forward in US exit strategy], 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094440/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported that in one [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] village, [[Kuz Khadokhel]], the Human Terrain Team (HTT) made it possible for negotiator Captain Aaron White to understand [[body language]] in the context of the culture, to identify leaders during negotiations, and to reinforce a perception of leadership by not conferring with fellow officers and by demonstrating good faith through projects facilitated by the Ghazni [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT), which included roads, a visit by the PRT's [[field hospital|mobile medical clinic]], the construction of a deep well for irrigation, and the beginnings of a road to Afghanistan's main [[Highway 1 (Afghanistan)|Highway 1]].&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt;

===Deaths===
[[Michael V. Bhatia]], a member of HTT AF1, was killed along with two other soldiers by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED (Improvised Explosive Device)]] while riding in a [[Humvee]] in [[Khost]], Afghanistan in May 2008.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geller|first=Adam|title=Professor Pays Ultimate Price in Country He Loved|newspaper=''[[Arizona Republic]]''|publisher=([[Associated Press]])|date=9 March 2009|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/03/08/20090308dangerous-onlinePART2.html|page=1|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geller /&gt;

Nicole Suveges, a member of HTT IZ3, was killed on 24 June 2008, along with 11 other soldiers, Iraqi government officials and United States Embassy personnel when a bomb exploded at the District Council building in [[Sadr City]].&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="hts.army" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SuevgesCNN&gt;{{cite news|title=American Grad Student Dies in Iraq|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/06/26/iraq.american.death/|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=CNN News|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2008, HTS member Paula Loyd was fatally injured whilst surveying the village of [[Chehel Gazi]] with a US Army platoon. She was doused with gasoline disguised in a jar of cooking oil and lit on fire by Abdul Salam, an Afghan national. Loyd was severely burned over 60 percent of her body.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|110}} Salam was captured by Don. M Ayala (another member of HTS) and other US Army personnel almost immediately after the attack, as he tried to escape.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|112}} About ten minutes later, after learning of the severity of Loyd's injuries, Ayala shot Salam in the head, killing him instantly. Loyd, 36, died at [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] in [[San Antonio]] on 7 January 2009.&lt;ref name="hts.army"&gt;[http://hts.army.mil/htsImageSliderMemoriam.aspx HTS Memoriam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818025311/http://hts.army.mil/htsImageSliderMemoriam.aspx |date=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in federal court in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] in February 2009.

===End of the HTS===
With the end of major American presences in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a shift towards electronic data collection, the need for HTS became less apparent.  On 30 September 2014, funding ended for the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/06/29/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-human-terrain-system/ The Rise and Fall of the Human Terrain System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and organizational structure==
[[File:Human terrain teams.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Human Terrain Team at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|An HTS senior seminar leader provides feedback to Human Terrain Teams at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in May 2010]]

=== Role of HTS in the US Army ===
HTS is defined as an "intelligence enabling capability",&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;{{rp|1}} and is categorized as "Intelligence support activity".&lt;ref name=HTSFAQs&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – FAQs|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsFAQ.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the HTS website, the aim of the program is to "provide sociocultural teams to commanders and staff" in the US Army in order to "improve the understanding of the local population", and to "apply this understanding to the [[Military Decision Making Process]] (MDMP)".&lt;ref name="HTS website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Terrain System|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/Default.aspx|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also argues that the program was designed to address an identified "operational need" in the US Army for "sociocultural support".&lt;ref name=HTSBackground&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – Background|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsAboutBackground.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTS components===
HTS has two main components: an institutional component referred to as the "Army Enduring Base", and an operational component referred to as "Deployed Teams".&lt;ref name=HTSComp&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS Components|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsComponentsDeployed.aspx|work=HTS website|publisher=www.army.mil|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both components include numerous sub-divisions.

====Army Enduring Base====

=====Project Office=====
The Project Office is based in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and is composed of the Director, the Deputy Director, and Project staff (including human resources, social scientists, knowledge management, and [[information technology]] (IT) teams).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Reachback Research Center (RRC)=====
The RRC is a [[Contiguous United States#CONUS and OCONUS|Continental United States (CONUS)]]-based research and analysis program that provides support to deployed HTTs, HTATs, and TCEs.  It is made up of a combination of social scientists, military analysts and civilian analysts who are organized into teams that specialize in research in a particular geographical region.  RRC personnel are responsible for supplying information from [[Open-source intelligence|open source]] and classified sources to deployed HTS teams, and for continuously updating HTS databases.&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====HTS training=====
HTS training is based at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in [[Kansas]]. Training focuses on field research methods, staff planning and procedures, and equipment training.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

====Deployed teams====

=====Human Terrain Teams (HTT)=====
Human Terrain Teams (HTT) work at the brigade or regimental level of the US Army. They undertake research among the local population, and represent that population (referred to as the "human terrain") in the various stages of military operations: planning, preparation, execution, and assessment.&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"&gt;

Human Terrain and Analysis Teams provide support to echelons of the US Army that are above brigade or regimental level (e.g., [[Division (military)|division]] or regional command).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;  They form a part of the Commander's staff and are responsible for analyzing the information provided by HTTs in order to support the Commander's Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTATs are made up of one Team Leader, one or two Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Coordination Elements (TCE)=====
TCEs are made up of a mixture of military and civilian staff. They are responsible for providing sociocultural support to the military staff and commanders of a particular operational region or theater.  A TCE comprises one Team Leader, three Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Support Office (TSO)=====
TSOs are responsible for providing administrative and logistics support to HTTs in a particular operational region or theater.  They are made up of one Theater Support Officer and a variably-sized support team.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Social Science Research and Analysis (SSRA)=====
SSRA is responsible for liaising with indigenous polling organizations and [[Small and medium enterprises|small or medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in order to gather data and information from the local population.  This information is then passed on to the TCE.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

===Methods===
The HTS program focuses on mapping the "human terrain" (i.e. the local population in an area in which military are deployed). In order to do this, HTTs create databases of information about local leaders, tribes or social groups, political disputes, economic issues, and social problems. This information is then analyzed by HTATs, used to advise military staff and commanders, and used to inform the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR" /&gt; Collected data is compiled and stored in a larger archive in order to be accessible for the military and other government agencies.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

===Equipment===
HTS has developed the MAP-HT Toolkit, an integrated software suite provided to HTTs for data visualization and reporting.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"/&gt;  This includes software for mapping (of the spatial distribution of social groups, for example), and for producing link charts (of power structures and social networks in informal economies, for example) and timelines.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=The Culture Warriors|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=30 November 2007|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/iraq/2007/11/30/the-pentagon-deploys-social-scientists-to-help-understand-iraqs-human-terrain.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components in the toolkit include: ANTHROPAC, UCINET, Axis PRO, [[i2 Limited|i2]] [[Analyst's Notebook]], and TerraExplorer, a 3D earth visualization application provided by Skyline Software Systems.

===Funding===
The initial funding for the Human Terrain System came from the [[Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization]] (JIEDDO).&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=John|authorlink=John Stanton (journalist)|title=General David Patraeus' Favorite Mushroom: Inside the U.S. Army's Human Terrain System|year=2009|publisher=Wiseman Publishing|location=|isbn=978-90-8963-019-3|pages=189|oclc=677926603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The JIEDDO funding of $20 million, granted in the summer 2006, supported the pilot HTS project from mid-2006 to 2007.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; Following the Central Command JUONS request for the major and rapid expansion of HTS in April 2007, the Defense Secretary approved a $40 million expansion of HTS to be funded by the Department of Defense (DOD).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;  DOD provided HTS funding until 2009 when funding responsibilities were assumed by Army [[Staff (military)#Continental Staff System|G2]] (i.e., the Army's Military Intelligence budget).&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt; In 2009 it was reported that the annual budget for the program was $143 million.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Caryl|title=Human Terrain Teams|journal=Foreign Policy|date=8 September 2009|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/08/reality_check_human_terrain_teams?page=0,0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 the HASC temporarily limited the funding obligation to HTS until the Army submitted an assessment of the program that addressed concerns that had been raised.&lt;ref name=Forte2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian|title=Human Terrain System Criticized by US Congress|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/2010/05/21/human-terrain-system-criticized-by-u-s-congress/|publisher=zeroanthropology.net|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, McFate stated that HTS had a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

==Public debate: praise, criticism and controversy==

===Praise and support===

====US government officials====
In a speech in 2008, [[Robert Gates]] (US Defense Secretary) praised HTS, saying that although the program had experienced early "teething problems" the "net effect" of HTS efforts was often "less violence across the board, with fewer hardships and casualties among civilians as a result".&lt;ref name=Jaschik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|title=A Pentagon Olive Branch to Academe|journal=Inside Higher Ed|date=16 April 2008|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/16/minerva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 article on HTS in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[David Rohde]], an American journalist who has twice won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], reported that one of the first HTTs to be deployed in Afghanistan had received "lavish" praise from officers for "helping them see the situation from an Afghan perspective and allowing them to cut back on combat operations".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He wrote that HTS had also been praised by Afghan and Western civilian officials in the area, although they had been "cautious about predicting long term success".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Rohde also cited Colonel David Woods (Commander of the 4th Squadron of the [[73rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|73rd Cavalry Regiment]]) as having remarked: "Call it what you want, it works ... It works in helping you define the problems, not just the symptoms."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In a statement to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2008, Colonel Martin Schweitzer, Commander of the 4th [[Brigade Combat Team]] of the [[82nd Airborne Division]], claimed that HTS capabilities had reduced his unit's "kinetic operations" in Afghanistan by 60–70 per cent within a year.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer&gt;{{cite web|last=Schweitzer|first=Martin P.|title=Statement of Colonel Martin P.

The US media has reported a number of positive review from HTS employees.  In 2008, ''World Politics Review'' ran a feature article on David Matsuda (a former professor of anthropology at [[California State University]]) who described HTS as "the chance to change the nature of warfare, the chance to anthropologize the military – and not the other way around – the chance to lessen casualties, avoid conflict, take people through the post-conflict to peace".&lt;ref name=McLeary&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeary|first=Paul|title=Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/2774/human-terrain-teams?page=2|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=World Politics Review|date=14 October 2008|format=.

====In the media====
In 2006, [[George Packer]], author of ''The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq'' and ''New Yorker'' magazine staff writer, wrote an article about the increasing use of social science in US military operations and the early trials of the HTS program. He reflected: "At a moment when the Bush Administration has run out of ideas and lost control, it could turn away from its "war on terror" and follow a different path – one that is right under its nose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Packer|first=George|title=Knowing the Enemy|newspaper=New Yorker (magazine)|date=18 December 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/18/061218fa_fact2#ixzz1bytdTVKw|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a (mainly critical) book about HTS entitled ''David Petraeus's Favorite Mushroom: Inside the US Army's Human Terrain System'' (2009), [[John Stanton (journalist)|John Stanton]] stated that HTS had been successful in advising a US military unit in Iraq on proper mealtime etiquette, i.e., not only how to properly eat, but also the gestures during the meal, and especially how to observe the Ramadan feast.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Criticism and controversy===

====American Anthropological Association====
{{quote box
 |title = |quote = When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.|source = —CEAUSSIC, Final Report on HTS (2009)|align = right|width = 30%|border = 1px|fontsize = 88%|bgcolor = |style = |title_bg = |title_fnt = |tstyle = |qalign = |qstyle = |salign = |sstyle =}}

On 31 October 2007, the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise".&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAstatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; The statement argued that HTS personnel would have responsibilities to the U.S military working in war zones that would conflict with anthropologists' duty, as outlined in the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 1), to "do no harm to those they study".&lt;ref name=AAAstatement /&gt; It further maintained that, working in a war zone, HTS personnel would be unable to ensure the "voluntary informed consent (without coercion)" of those whom they communicate with, as is also required by the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 4).&lt;ref name=AAAstatement/&gt;

In December 2008, the AAA Executive Board followed up their initial statement of disapproval by asking the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) to thoroughly review the HTS program.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; CEAUSSIC's "Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain Proof-of-Concept System" was released in December 2009.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR&gt;{{cite book|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |year=2009|publisher=AAA|url=https://www.box.com/shared/kg8t2cop82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |date=14 October 2009|url=http://www.policyscience.net/CEAUSSIC_HTS_Final_Report.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEAUSSIC's 74-page report argued that the "goals" and "basic identity" of HTS were characterized by "confusion", and that the program was designed to simultaneously perform multiple tasks that were "potentially irreconcilable"; e.g., serving as research function whilst also operating as "a source of intelligence" and a "tactical function in counterinsurgency warfare".&lt;ref name=Glenn /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It added that this confusion would make it unclear to anthropologists whether they could follow the Code of Ethics or not.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; The commission further maintained that HTS personnel would be unable to "maintain reliable control" over the information they collected, and that there was a "significant likelihood" that HTS data would be used "as part of military intelligence", which would place "researchers and their counterparts in the field in harm's way".&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It also noted that if HTS were a research organization, "it would be required to comply with federal law for subject protection" and suggested that it was "unusual" that the program had avoided oversight by an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB).&lt;ref name=Zehfuss /&gt; In conclusion, the report stated: "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology". It recommended that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with [[Anthropology|anthropological]] disciplinary ethics and practice.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICreport&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=CEAUSSIC Releases Final Report on Army HTS Program|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/CEAUSSIC-Releases-Final-Report-on-Army-HTS-Program.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the AAA restated their disapproval of the HTS program after a cover story article in [[C4ISR Journal|''C4ISR'']] (a ''[[Defense News]]'' publication) claimed that "the controversy ha[d] cooled" and that HTS would have a recruiter at the annual AAA meeting in November that year.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name="C41SR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAblog&gt;{{cite web|last=AAA blog|title=Anthropologists and the Human Terrain System|url=http://blog.aaanet.org/2012/04/25/anthropologists-and-the-human-terrain-system/|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAA denied both claims.&lt;ref name=C41SR /&gt;

====Anthropologists====
In 2007, the [[Network of Concerned Anthropologists]] (NCA) was founded by a group of anthropologists, largely in response to the HTS program.&lt;ref name=JacksonMIT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Jean|title=Anthropologists Express Concern Over Government Plan to Support Military Research|journal=MIT Faculty Newsletter|date=May–June 2008|volume=20|issue=1|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/205/jackson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite&gt;{{cite web|last=Network of Concerned Anthropologists|title=NCA website|url=https://sites.google.com/site/concernedanthropologists/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Network wrote an "Anthropologists' Statement on the Human Terrain System Program" to the [[United States House of Representatives]], which was signed by over 700 anthropologists.&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Do Professional Ethics Matter in War?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=March 2010|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/do-professional-ethics-matter-war|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement called for Congress to halt governmental support to HTS and cancel plans for its expansion, giving the following reasons: "There is no evidence that HTS is effective"; "HTS is dangerous and reckless"; "HTS wastes taxpayers money"; "HTS is unethical for anthropologists and other social scientists".&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite /&gt;

Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]]), [[Hugh Gusterson]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[George Mason University]]), and [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) – three of the founding members of NCA – have all written numerous articles criticizing HTS as an effort to "weaponize anthropology". In a 2010 article, Gusterson wrote of the program: "The Pentagon seems to have decided that anthropology is to the war on terror what physics was to the [[cold war]]".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;  He criticized HTS for performing "drive-by research" as well as violating disciplinary ethics, arguing that the AAA Code of Ethics is comparable to the [[Hippocratic oath]]: "Asking an anthropologist to gather intelligence that may lead to someone's death or imprisonment ... is like asking an army doctor to kill a wounded insurgent".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Flintoff&gt;{{cite web|last=Flintoff|first=Corey|title=Marines Tap Social Sciences in Afghan War Effort|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125502485|publisher=NPR|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Price has described HTS as part of a "[[neocolonialism|neocolonial]]" mission.&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; "Human Terrain System", he maintained, "is not some neutral humanitarian project, it is an arm of the US military and it is part of the military's mission to occupy and destroy opposition to US goals and objectives ... HTS's goal is a gentler form of domination".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; In an article in ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'' in April 2009, Price disputed Colonel Schweitzer's claims that HTS had reduced kinetic action by 60–70%, reporting that his efforts to track the studies (via the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]) on which these statistics were based resulted in Schweitzer's admission that there were no such studies and that the statistics were a "loose estimate".&lt;ref name=counterpunch.com /&gt;  In the same article, Price also criticized the coverage of HTS in the US media and published a list of ten fundamental issues that reporters needed to address.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency's free ride|journal=Counterpunch|date=7 April 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.com/price04072009.html |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026015533/http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/04/07/counterinsurgency-s-free-ride/ |archivedate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper from 2009, [[Neil L Whitehead]], Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], questioned whether HTS can work in the way that it is promoted to do.  Drawing on anthropological studies of warfare that demonstrate the socially transformative effects of warfare and military action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=R. Brain|title=War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Warfare|year=2000|publisher=School of American Research Press|isbn=0933452802|author2=Neil L. Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead argued that the practice of anthropology becomes "highly problematic" in a situation where anthropology is being deployed to report on "the very phenomenon it is a part of changing, whether consciously or not".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt; He therefore suggested that ethical objections to HTS are not limited to the anthropologist's potential violation of their duty of confidentiality and responsibility to their informants, but also include the questionable "ethical responsibility" of those anthropologists and military planners "erroneously" promoting HTS as being able to work in ways that "in all likelihood" cannot actually work, thereby "endangering anthropologists and soldiers alike".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt;

Other anthropologists who have criticized HTS include [[Marshall Sahlins]], who describes HTS as "manipulating local culture, imposing [our government's objectives] on them, transforming anthropologists into spies, and putting people you work with [in the locale] at risk"; and Maximilian Forte, who has published numerous articles on HTS in academic journals and on internet websites.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobsen|first=Kurt|title=Are we there just to help the Army aim better?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/may/13/internationaleducationnews.highereducation|accessdate=24 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteZA&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|title=Max Forte|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/about-the-bloggers/max-forte/|publisher=Zeroanthropology.net|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military officials and former HTS personnel====
In 2009, Major Ben Connable ([[Marine Corps]]) published an article in ''[[Military Review]]'' which argued that HTS was "undermining" the US Army's "cultural competence".&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Connable&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connable|first=Ben|title=All our Eggs in a Broken Basket: How the Human Terrain System is Undermining Sustainable Military Cultural Competence|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2009|pages=57–64|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20090430_art010.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former HTS personnel have also criticized the program. In 2007, social scientist Zenia Helbig was fired from HTS after raising concerns that the program was disorganized and provided insufficient region-specific training.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title=Military Research: The Pentagon's Culture Wars|journal=Nature|date=October 2001|volume=455|pages=583–585|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081001/full/455583a.html|doi=10.1038/455583a|accessdate=25 June 2012|issue=7213|pmid=18833247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchactmanZH&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Army Social Scientists Calm Afghanistan, Make Enemies at Home|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/11/human_terrain?currentPage=1|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HelbigAAA&gt;{{cite news|last=Helbig|first=Zenia|title=Personal Perspective on HTS: Address to AAA Conference (.doc)|url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/files/aaa_helbig_hts.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2012|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Matt Tompkins, an HTT Leader, remarked that defense contractors supporting HTS were not providing sufficient training or staffing, and that the social scientists on his team lacked region-specific expertise.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012 /&gt; After resigning from the program in 2010, John Allison criticized HTS for its doctrinal inflexibility and lack of openness to anthropological perspectives and suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref name=Price2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain System Dissenter Resigns, Tells Inside Story of Training's Heart of Darkness|journal=Counterpunch|date=15 February 2010|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2010/02/15/human-terrain-systems-dissenter-resigns-tells-inside-story-of-training-s-heart-of-darkness/|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NDU Study====
In June 2013, a team of four researchers from the US [[National Defense University]] in Washington, DC published an in-depth assessment of HTS and the HTTs in Afghanistan, entitled ''Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare''.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Christopher|last2=Orton|first2=James Douglas|last3=Davies|first3=Michael C.|last4=Pikulsky|first4=Theodore T.|title=Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare|year=2013|publisher=Institute of World Politics Press|location=|isbn=978-0988864207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first publicly released book with a history of the program as well as an assessment of the teams in the field. The study's conclusions were also published in ''Joint Force Quarterly'' in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|title=The Way Ahead for Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=739537|publisher=NDU Press|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study emerged from the [[Project for National Security Reform]] and its flagship assessment of the US national security system, [[Forging a New Shield]]. The study interviewed 87 individuals in a total of 105 interviews. The participants were principally team members, with commanders (primarily Brigade- and Task Force-level commanders) being the core variable able to define effectiveness of the team under their command. HTS program managers, knowledgeable defense-related persons, and some Iraq team members were interviewed.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|157}} In researching the program's history, the study's authors found that the relationship between HTS and the Army's [[Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) was one of the primary reasons for the problems within the program. Decisions made about HTS by TRADOC, such as new personnel contracts, had a negative impact on the program. However, the lack of a theory of performance in the beginning by HTS, and the lack of continual assessments of the teams in the field by HTS, meant that the program managers lacked the knowledge to train and deploy effective HTTs.

The authors also point out that the study's assessments strongly agree with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at [[West Point]], the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] (CNA), and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited the effectiveness of the teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|175–176}}

The NDU study was different in that it categorized the commanders' assessments according to basic concepts of "Cultural Awareness" (Description), "Cultural Understanding" (Explanation), and "Cultural Intelligence" (Prediction). It was found that most commanders only found and used their HTTs at the first level, Awareness. Some of the better performing HTTs could offer Understanding. Only a few HTTs, the very high performing teams with highly effective individuals, held a strong sense of teamwork and were commanded by culturally aware units and commanders. If commanders did not care about cultural issues, which did occur in some cases, the team would have no impact regardless of the team's effectiveness in other circumstances.

Finally, the nature of the intelligence architecture in Afghanistan was seen as the issue that had the biggest impact on HTT performance. Because the intelligence architecture did not value sociocultural knowledge and was not built to provide it, HTTs themselves had to be the ground sensors, a role they had not been designed to fulfill. HTTs were intended to be the aggregators of knowledge at the Brigade level to synthesize information to commanders directly. If HTTs had been built to be the sensors, they would have had to be multiplied in size and number many times over. By utilizing the HTTs as the primary interviewers and data analysts, their effectiveness was constrained. Since HTT members had relatively short tours (9–12 months), and would usually have a new Brigade arrive in the middle of their tour, their effectiveness was further reduced by their constant need to train new units on area features. The NDU team concluded that had soldiers themselves been the primary sensors on the ground, as recommended in LTG [[Michael T. Flynn]]'s ''Fixing Intel'' monograph, HTTs would have better been able to perform the role they were originally intended to serve.&lt;ref name="Flynnbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flly|first1=Michael T.|last2=Pottinger|first2=Matthew|last3=Batchelor|first3=Paul D.|title=Fixing Intel|year=2010|publisher=Center for a New American Security|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDU book ends by suggesting that HTS be turned over to the [[U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC). There were a number of reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple programmatic problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a greater degree than regular Army/Marines units.

====In the media====
[[Ann Marlowe]] wrote a piece about HTS for the ''Weekly Standard'' in November 2007, stating that "there are some things the Army needs in Afghanistan, but more academics are not at the top of the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marlowe|first=Ann|title=Anthropology Goes to War|newspaper=The Weekly Standard (magazine)|date=26 November 2007|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/15464 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a quantity grows towards a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] under a finite variation (a "[[finite-time singularity]]") it is said to undergo '''hyperbolic growth'''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [https://www.academia.edu/32757085/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics._Models_of_the_World_System_Development._Moscow_KomKniga_URSS_2006 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006. P. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the [[reciprocal function]] &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; has a [[hyperbola]] as a graph, and has a singularity at 0, meaning that the [[limit of a function|limit]] as &lt;math&gt;x \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is infinite: any similar graph is said to exhibit hyperbolic growth.

==Description==
If the output of a function is [[inversely proportional]] to its input, or inversely proportional to the difference from a given value &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, the function will exhibit hyperbolic growth, with a singularity at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In the real world hyperbolic growth is created by certain non-linear [[positive feedback]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Alexander V. Markov]],  and [[Andrey Korotayev|Andrey V. Korotayev]] (2007). [https://www.academia.edu/24472865/Phanerozoic_marine_biodiversity_follows_a_hyperbolic_trend "Phanerozoic marine biodiversity follows a hyperbolic trend". Palaeoworld. Volume 16. Issue 4. Pages 311-318].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with other growth===
Like [[exponential growth]] and [[logistic growth]], hyperbolic growth is highly [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], but differs in important respects.
These functions can be confused, as exponential growth, hyperbolic growth, and the first half of logistic growth are [[convex function]]s; however their [[asymptotic behavior]] (behavior as input gets large) differs dramatically:
* logistic growth is constrained (has a finite limit, even as time goes to infinity),
* exponential growth grows to infinity as time goes to infinity (but is always finite for finite time),
* hyperbolic growth has a singularity in finite time (grows to infinity at a finite time).

==Applications==

===Population===
Certain mathematical models suggest that until the early 1970s the [[world population]] underwent hyperbolic growth (see, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''] by [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.''). It was also shown that until the 1970s the hyperbolic growth of the world population was accompanied by quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world [[GDP]], and developed a number of [[mathematical model]]s describing both this phenomenon, and the [[World-system theory|World System]] withdrawal from the blow-up regime observed in the recent decades. The hyperbolic growth of the [[world population]] and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world [[GDP]] observed till the 1970s have been correlated by [[Andrey Korotayev]]  and his colleagues to a non-linear second order [[positive feedback]] between the demographic growth and technological development, described by a chain of causation: technological growth leads to more [[carrying capacity]] of land for people, which leads to more people, which leads to more inventors, which in turn leads to yet more technological growth, and on and on.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [https://www.academia.edu/32757085/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics._Models_of_the_World_System_Development._Moscow_KomKniga_URSS_2006 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006; Korotayev A. V. [http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf A Compact Macromodel of World System Evolution // Journal of World-Systems Research 11/1 (2005): 79–93.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706205516/http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf |date=July 6, 2009 }}; for a detailed mathematical analysis of this issue see [https://www.academia.edu/25994385/A_compact_mathematical_model_of_the_World_System_economic_and_demographic_growth_1_CE_1973_CE A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE - 1973 CE. "International Journal of Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences". 2016. Vol. 10, pp. 200-209 ].&lt;/ref&gt; Other models suggest [[exponential growth]], logistic growth, or other functions.

===Queuing theory===
Another example of hyperbolic growth can be found in [[queueing theory]]: the average waiting time of randomly arriving customers grows hyperbolically as a function of the average load ratio of the server. The singularity in this case occurs when the average amount of work arriving to the server equals the server's processing capacity. If the processing needs exceed the server's capacity, then there is no well-defined average waiting time, as the queue can grow without bound. A practical implication of this particular example is that for highly loaded queuing systems the average waiting time can be extremely sensitive to the processing capacity.

===Enzyme kinetics===
A further practical example of hyperbolic growth can be found in [[enzyme kinetics]]. When the rate of reaction (termed velocity) between an [[enzyme]] and [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] is plotted against various concentrations of the substrate, a hyperbolic plot is obtained for many simpler systems. When this happens, the enzyme is said to follow [[Enzyme kinetics#Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten]]  kinetics.

==Mathematical example==
The function
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{1}{t_c-t}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits hyperbolic growth with a singularity at time &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt;: in the [[limit of a function|limit]] as &lt;math&gt;t \to t_c&lt;/math&gt;, the function goes to infinity.

More generally, the function
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{K}{t_c-t}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits hyperbolic growth, where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scale factor]].

Note that this algebraic function can be regarded as analytical solution for the function's differential:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [https://www.academia.edu/32757085/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics._Models_of_the_World_System_Development._Moscow_KomKniga_URSS_2006 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006. P. 118-123.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{K}{(t_c-t)^2}=\frac{x^2}{K}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that with hyperbolic growth the absolute growth rate of the variable x in the moment t is proportional to the square of the value of x in the moment t.

Respectively, the quadratic-hyperbolic function looks as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{K}{(t_c-t)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ishikism''', [pron: 'Ishik-ism] ({{lang-tr|Işıkçılık}}) or '''Ishik Alevism''' (''{{lang|tr|Işık Aleviliği}}''), also known as '''Chinarism''' (''{{lang|tr|Çınarcılık}}''), is a [[new religious movement|new]] [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement among [[Alevism|Alevis]] who have developed an alternative understanding of [[Alevism]] and its history. These alternative interpretations and beliefs were inspired by Turkish writer Erdoğan Çınar with the publication of his book ''Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi'' (''The Secret History of Alevism'') in 2004.

==Işık faith==
While mainstream Alevis believe the term ''"Alevi"'' means  "follower of [[Ali]]", as in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word [[‘Alawī]] (علوي), and consider themselves followers of the teachings and practices of 13th-century Alevi saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]], Ishik believe differently. The Ishik movement claim that the term "Alevi" is derived from the old [[Anatolia]]n [[Luvians]], claiming that the word "Luvi" means "People of light" in the [[Hittite language]]. Some [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] documents from the 16th century refer to the ancestors of today's Alevis as "Işık Taifesi", meaning "People of Light". This is, according to Ishikīs, a proof of the connection between the Luvians and Alevis.

The Ishik Alevis have been likened to the Kurdish [[Yezidi]]s, as part of a wider monotheistic tradition called [[Yazdanism]].  A shared cultural history of that nature relates to common folklore describing the invention of agriculture by plant domestication.  Wheat is assumed to have been first cultured in the northern part of the Middle East; and likewise, regional peoples shared a culinary tradition in the types of vegetables they consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pieroni | first1 = Andrea | first2 = Hiwa M. | last2 = Ahmed | first3 = Hawre | last3 = Zahir| title = The spring has arrived: traditional wild vegetables gathered by Yarsanis (Ahl-e Haqq) and Sunni Muslims in Western Hawraman, SE Kurdistan, Iraq | journal = history | volume = 86| issue =1 | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-image===
Ishikīs consider themselves to be [[Esotericism|esotericists]], claiming that Alevism is Esotericism itself, meaning that they identify themselves with every type of esotericism in history (e.g. [[Jewish]] esotericists, [[Christian]] esotericists, [[Islam]]ic and [[Pagan]] esotericism etc.)

They claim that [[Alevism]] is the oldest religion in the world, that has changed shapes throughout time. This "First and True Religion" of the world, is claimed to have been the main source for all other religions and beliefs in the world:

{{quote|It has now been brought into the open with all its truth, that Alevism, with its tens of thousands of years of history, has influenced all beliefs and has been the Original Source (the so-called "Serçeşme" - meaning "Beginning Spot of Fountain") of the celestial religions.| Erdoğan Çınar in: ''Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi'', 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|tr|Aleviliğin, on binlerce yıllık geçmişten gelen, bütün inanışları etkilemiş, semavi dinlere başlangıç oluşturmuş asıl kaynak, "Serçeşme", olduğunu bütün gerçekliğiyle ortaya çıkartıyor.}}" in: {{harvnb|Çınar|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Ishikīs also claim that the religious ceremonies practiced by [[Alevis]] were practiced as early as by the [[Hittites]] and even by the [[Sumer]]ians. According to Ishikīs, medieval [[Christian]] sects as [[Paulicianism]], [[Bogomilism]] etc. were also [[Alevis]]. A good example of this belief can be found in the translation of the book ''The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sean Martin (writer and director)|Sean Martin]]|title=The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages |year=2005 |publisher=Pocket Essentials}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005) by [[Sean Martin (writer and director)|Sean Martin]]. Even though the original [[English language|English]] version does not contain the word "Alevi", the Turkish translator has translated the title of the book as ''Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi - Katharlar'' (An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sean Martin |title=Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi – Katharlar |trans-title=An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars |year=2005 |publisher=Kalkedon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical beliefs===
Compared to traditional [[Alevism]], the most striking differences of the Ishik movement are their interpretation of history. The Ishik movement claims that [[Alevis]] have changed their apparent identity several times in history in order to survive. According to Ishikī belief, [[heretic]] sects like the Paulicians and Bogomils were actually [[Alevis]] compelled to appear as [[Christian]]s because of the [[Byzantine]] oppression. Likewise the modern [[Alevis]] have gained an Islamic appearance because of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] oppression.

Ishikī thought is convinced that most [[heterodox]] groups are inventions as a result of oppression, meaning that groups like the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]], [[Bektashism and folk religion|Bektashism]], [[Ibn Nusayr|Nusayrī]] [[Alawism]], [[Ghulāt]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]] are in reality separate from real [[Islam]].
 	
==Criticism==
The Ishikī versus Traditionalist split has caused a deep gap in [[Alevi]] society. This is the first time in centuries that [[Alevis]] have experienced such a great split in terms of beliefs.

*Traditionalist [[Alevis]] have strongly opposed the Ishikīs, who they consider as people who are creating a completely new religion, or sometimes as undercover agents, trying to disrupt [[Alevi]] unity. Ishikīs are also criticized for being extremely political and for abandoning fundamental [[Alevi]] sources, such as the [[Buyruks]], one of the most known written source among [[Alevis]].
*The Alevi historian, Hamza Aksüt, responded to the works of Erdoğan Çınar in several articles, criticizing him for being intentionally manipulative and highly conspirational. were officially given as a reply to the interview with Erdoğan Çınar: ''Çınar'dan uyarı: 'Her flörtün sonu evlilikle bitmez''' (Notice from Çınar: 'Not all flirts end with marriage').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hamza Aksüt |title=Çınar'dan uyarı: 'Her flörtün sonu evlilikle bitmez' |publisher=renkhaber |date=9 March 2009 |url=http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Roportaj.56/Cinar_dan_uyari___Her_flortun_sonu_evlilikle_bitmez_/8270.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319080118/http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Roportaj.56/Cinar_dan_uyari___Her_flortun_sonu_evlilikle_bitmez_/8270.html |archivedate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer, Ünsal Öztürk has also criticized Erdoğan Çınar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ünsal Öztürk |title=Yazın hayatının tanımadığı bir facia: Erdoğan Çınar |publisher=renkhaber |date=10 March 2009 |url=http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Yorum_Analiz.39/Yazin_hayatinin_tanimadigi_bir_facia__Erdogan_Cinar/8316.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121042710/http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Yorum_Analiz.39/Yazin_hayatinin_tanimadigi_bir_facia__Erdogan_Cinar/8316.html |archivedate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Hamza Aksüt, Hasan Harmancı and Ünsal Öztürk went together in publishing the book ''Alevi Tarih Yazımında Skandal – Erdoğan Çınar Örneği'' (A Scandal in Alevi History Writing – The Erdoğan Çınar Example), which is an analysis and explaining of the claimed manipulation and "tampering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harmancı |first=Hamza |title=Alevi Tarih Yazımında Skandal |publisher=Yurt Kitap Yayın |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by Erdoğan Çınar.
*''Erdoğan Çınar'' received lots of criticism from [[Alevi]]s and Alevi [[Dede (religious figure)|Dedes]] (for example Baki Güngör dede&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|3G5xw_AD8WM}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who claim that Çınar's book is full of misconceptions and contradictions and consider it as yet another attempt of ''"Yol-Yezidiler" (enemies of the path of their tariqa)'' to assimilate the [[Alevi]]s and to separate them from the mystic teachings of [[Haji Bektash Veli]], [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], [[Yunus Emre]] and [[The Twelve Imams]].
*Some traditionalists have even gone so far as to demand that Ishikī dedes like ''Hasan Kılavuz'' should get the penalty of social exclusion which in reality does not correspond with the actual welcoming nature of Alevisim.

==Ishikī Dedes==
Even though most [[dedes]] are still traditionalists, some of them have eventually adopted Ishikī thought. The first dedes who openly declared their non-traditionalist beliefs were Ali Haydar Cilasun, with the publication of his book ''Alevilik Bir Sır Değildir'' (Alevism is Not a Secret) in 1995, and Hasan Kılavuz in 2003. The latter is now one of the prominent figures in the Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) and its television channel YOL TV.

==Ishikī organizations==
The Ishik movement have succeeded in becoming very influential in important and powerful [[Alevi]] organizations.{{dubious|date=November 2015}} The Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) for instance, has abandoned its traditional Alevi beliefs in 2006, which it replaced with a marginal Ishikī type{{Original research inline|date=November 2015}} of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AABF ve AABK yeni proğram değişikliği ile Aleviliği kuşa çevirmeye devam ediyor! |publisher=Alevi Yolu |date=15 January 2007 |url=http://www.aleviyolu.net/15-01-2007/aabf-ve-aabk-yeni-program-degisikligi-ile-aleviligi-kusa-cevirmeye-devam-ediyor.html

The '''Langenberg transmission tower''' (also translated as "Sender Langenberg" or "Transmission Facility Langenberg") is a broadcasting station that transmits [[mediumwave|MW]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[TV]] signals.  It is located in [[Langenberg (Rhineland)|Langenberg]], [[Velbert]], [[Germany]] and has had a very turbulent history since its inauguration.  The [[transmitter]] first went into service in 1927 with 60 [[kilowatt]]s (kW) of power and a [[T-aerial]] hanging on two 100-metre freestanding steel-frame towers insulated against ground.

==Attempted manipulation==
In the early 1930s, [[communism|communist]] underground groups tried to manipulate the line from the studio to the transmitter in order to broadcast their own propaganda. Their attempts failed, but they did manage to attach a red star to the top of one of the towers, which was removed on the same day.

==Modifications==

===Pre-1945===
In 1934 the T-aerial was replaced by an [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]] hanging from a 160-metre wood framework tower and the transmission power was increased to 100&amp;nbsp;kW. However, this tower was destroyed on October 10, 1935 by a [[tornado]].  After this a triangular aerial hung on three 45-metre freestanding towers was built; this went into service in December 1935.  In 1940/41 a second aerial was installed on a 240-metre insulated guyed steel tube mast. The entire aerial system was destroyed by [[Postschutz|SS-Postschutz]] troops on April 12, 1945.

===Post-1945===
After [[World War II]], [[United Kingdom|British]] forces built two triangular aerials mounted on 6 masts, each 50 metres high.  One of these aerials was removed in 1948 and a {{convert|160|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} insulated [[radio]] mast built on its site.  The other aerial was destroyed in a storm in 1949 which broke two of the three masts.  The third mast was transformed into an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmitter and was in service until 1957.  In 1949 a second radio mast with a height of 120 metres was built, and in 1952 a third guyed mast followed with a height of 210 metres for FM and TV. The 120-metre mast was used as an AM transmitter and was insulated against [[Ground (electricity)|ground]], while the 210-metre mast, used eventually for TV and FM broadcasts, was grounded.

===The 1960s===
In the middle of the 1960s the transmission power of the AM transmitter was enormously increased and its frequency was changed to the almost clear [[frequency]] of 1586 [[kilohertz|kHz]] which allowed night-time reception, even in the USA.  This 120-metre radio mast was reduced to 95 metres and it was equipped with two separation insulators.

===The 1970s===
In course of the workout of the [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975]], the facility lost the exclusive frequency of 1586&amp;nbsp;kHz and the transmitter was retuned to 1593&amp;nbsp;kHz. Because this frequency is used by other broadcasters, [[Co-channel interference|interference]] problems occurred at night-time in spite of the 800&amp;nbsp;kW transmitting power.  As compensation, station owner WDR was allotted a second medium wave frequency of 720&amp;nbsp;kHz for daytime transmission only.

===The 1980s===
Between 1988 and 1990, the 95-metre mediumwave mast and the 210-metre TV- and FM-mast were replaced by a {{convert|301|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} guyed steel-framework grounded radio mast with a [[cage aerial]] for mediumwave in its lower sections.

===The 1990s===
In 1993, the 1593&amp;nbsp;kHz mediumwave transmitter was shut down because some components had been manufactured with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s. 720&amp;nbsp;kHz remained in service, but it was not allowed to use this frequency for night transmission until new regulations were enacted in 1995.

At these point there were two radio masts in Langenberg: the 160-metre radio mast for medium wave and the 301-metre radio mast for MW, FM and TV. The shorter mast had to be renovated in 1996; unfortunately, one auxiliary rope tore during this work and the mast collapsed on September 2, 1996.

In 1995 the transmission power had to be reduced for ecological reasons. Until the early 1990s the whole radiated power in the AM range was 1000&amp;nbsp;kW (800&amp;nbsp;kW on 1593&amp;nbsp;kHz and 200&amp;nbsp;kW on 720&amp;nbsp;kHz), but after 1995 the transmitter was restricted to 85&amp;nbsp;kW. After the collapse of the 160 metre mast, radiation power of the AM transmitter was reduced to 20&amp;nbsp;kW.

Soon after the collapse of the 160 metre mast, WDR planned a new mast in the form of a guyed grounded steel framework with a height of 170 metres and a cage aerial.  The medium wave frequency of 1593&amp;nbsp;kHz was given to [[Radio Free Europe]].  The 720&amp;nbsp;kHz transmitter was fitted with a directional antenna that minimized propagation of signals westward. Construction of the new mast started in the middle of 1999, but problems delayed its inauguration until July 2000.  After the inauguration of the new 170-metre radio mast, transmitter power on medium wave could be once again increased to 85&amp;nbsp;kW.

'''Magnetomyography''' ('''MMG''') is a technique for mapping muscle activity by recording [[magnetic field]]s produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the [[muscle]]s, using arrays of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices). It has a better capability than [[electromyography]] for detecting slow or direct currents. The magnitude of the MMG signal is in the scale of pico (10−12) to femto (10−15) Tesla (T). Miniaturizing MMG offers a prospect to modernize the bulky SQUID to wearable miniaturized magnetic sensors  &lt;ref&gt; Heidari, H., Zuo, S., Krasoulis, A. and Nazarpour, K. (2018) CMOS Magnetic Sensors for Wearable Magnetomyography. In: 40th International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Honolulu, HI, USA, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
At the early 18th century, the electric signals from living tissues have been investigated. These researchers have promoted many innovations in healthcare especially in medical diagnostic. Some example is based on electrical signals produced by human tissues, including Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG). Besides, with the development of technologies, the biomagnetic measurement from the human body, consisting of  Magnetocardiogram (MCG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Magnetomyogram (MMG), provided clear evidence that the existence of the magnetic fields from ionic action currents in electrically active tissues can be utilized to record activities. For the first attempt, Cohen et al. used a point-contact superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in a shielded room to measure the MCG. They reported that the sensitivity of the recorded MCG was orders of magnitude higher than the previously recorded MCG. The same researcher continued this MEG measurement by using a more sensitive SQUID magnetometer without noise averaging. He compared the EEG and alpha rhythm MEG recorded by both normal and abnormal subjects.  It is shown that the MEG has produced some new and different information provided by the EEG. Because the heart can produce a relatively large magnetic field compared to the brain and other organs, the early biomagnetic field research originated from the mathematical modelling of MCG. Early experimental studies also focused on the MCG. In addition, these experimental studies suffer from unavoidable low spatial resolution and low sensitivity due to the lack of sophisticated detection methods. With advances in technology, research has expanded into brain function, and preliminary studies of evoked MEGs began in the 1980s.
These studies provided some details about which neuronal populations were contributing to the magnetic signals generated from the brain. However, the signals from single neurons were too weak to be detected. A group of over 10,000 dendrites is required as a group to generate a detectable MEG signal. At the time, the abundance of physical, technical, and mathematical limitations prevented quantitative comparisons of theories and experiments involving human electrocardiograms and other biomagnetic records. Due to the lack of an accurate micro source model, it is more difficult to determine which specific physiological factors influence the strength of MEG and other biomagnetic signals and which factors dominate the achievable spatial resolution.
In the past three decades, a great deal of research has been conducted to measure and analyze the magnetic field generated by the flow of ex vivo currents in isolated axons and muscle fibers. These measurements have been supported by some complex theoretical studies and the development of ultra-sensitive room temperature amplifiers and neuromagnetic current probes. Nowadays, cell-level magnetic recording technology has become a quantitative measurement technique for operating currents.

==Miniaturized MMG==
Very recently CMOS compatible magnetic sensors have been proposed for future of MMG in form of wearable devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''Metapragmatics''' is a term from the [[Semiotics|semiotically]]-informed [[linguistic anthropology]] of [[Michael Silverstein]] that describes how the effects and conditions of language use themselves become objects of discourse. Metapragmatic signalling allows participants to construe what is going on in an interaction. Examples include:
* describing the "correct way" of using language ("I before E except after C."),
* specifying under which conditions a specific kind of communication are, or should be, used ("You should never tell a dirty joke at a funeral."),
* signalling, explicitly or implicitly, the type of social event occurring (explicit: "I promise to be there at 3:00 p.m." implicit: "I will be there at 3:00 p.m.")
* linking speech to another event outside the moment of speaking ("Every day she goes jogging." ).

Discussions of linguistic [[pragmatics]]—that is, discussions of what speech ''does'' in a particular context—are meta-pragmatic, because they describe the meaning of speech as action. Although it is useful to distinguish semantic (i.e. denotative or referential) meaning (dictionary meaning) from pragmatic meaning, and thus metasemantic discourse (for example, "Mesa means 'table' in Spanish") from metapragmatic utterances (e.g. "Say 'thank you' to your grandmother," or "It is impolite to swear in mixed company"), meta-[[semantic]] characterizations of speech are a type of metapragmatic speech. This follows from the assertion that metapragmatic speech characterizes speech function, and denotation or reference are among the many functions of speech. Because metapragmatics describes relations between different discourses it relates crucially to the concepts of [[intertextuality]] or [[interdiscursivity]].

In [[linguistic anthropology|anthropology]], describing the rules of use for metapragmatic speech (in the same way that a grammar would describe the rules of use for 'ordinary' or semantic speech) is important because it can aid the understanding and analysis of a culture's [[language ideology]]. Silverstein has also described universal limits on metapragmatic awareness that help explain why some linguistic forms seem to be available to their users for conscious comment, while other forms seem to escape awareness despite efforts by a researcher to ask native speakers to repeat them or characterize their use.

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]], or reflexive, metapragmatic statements are [[Indexicality|indexical]]. That is, their meaning comes from their temporal contiguity with their referent: themselves. Example: "This is an example sentence."

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] discussed the method of loci in his ''[[De Oratore]]''.]]
The '''method of loci''' (''loci'' being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. The method of loci is also known as the '''memory journey''', '''memory palace''', or '''mind palace technique'''. This method is a [[mnemonic]] device  adopted in [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Oratore]]'', and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''). Many [[Memory sport|memory contest]] champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

The term is most often found in specialised works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[Lynn Nadel]] refer to:&lt;blockquote&gt;'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by [[Frances Yates|Yates]] (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.&lt;ref name="cognitivemap"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = O'Keefe| first1 =John |last2 = Nadel |first2 =Lynn| authorlink2 = Lynn Nadel  | title =The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = December 7, 1978| location = Oxford|url =http://www.cognitivemap.net | isbn = 978-0198572060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Roman Room Technique| work = AcademicTips.org| url =http://www.academictips.org/memory/romanrom.html| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Many effective memorisers today use the "method of loci" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the [[World Memory Championship]], was initiated in 1991 and the first [[USA Memory Championship|United States championship]] was held in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Foer| first =Joshua| authorlink =Joshua Foer| title =Forget Me Not: How to win the U.S. memory championship| work =[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = March 16, 2005| url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html| accessdate = October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to [[long-term memory]] a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, "stop" at each locus, and "observe" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.

Memory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time [[World Memory Champion]] [[Dominic O'Brien]] uses this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 1997 World Memory Championships| work = Mind Sports Worldwide| url =http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121614/http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Town_System_for_Languages|title=Memory Town System for Languages - Memory Techniques Wiki|author=|date=|website=mt.artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[World Memory Champion]], [[Clemens Mayer]], used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in "number half marathon", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise [[pi]] to over 65,536 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Using this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. {{cn|date=September 2017}} The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 5 Minute Speed Cards| work = World Memory Statistics| publisher = World Memory Sports Council| url =http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/discipline.php?id=spdcards| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - Coursera|author=|date=|website=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:
# Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and
# Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.

The method of loci has also been shown to help sufferers of [[Major depressive disorder | depression]] remember positive, self-affirming memories.&lt;ref name="Dagleish"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalgleish |first=Tim |last2=Navrady |first2=Lauren |last3=Bird |first3=Elinor |last4=Hill |first4=Emma |last5=Dunn |first5=Barnaby D. |last6=Golden |first6=Ann-Marie |date=12 February 2013 |title=Method-of-Loci as a Mnemonic Device to Facilitate Access to Self-Affirming Personal Memories for Individuals With Depression |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702612468111 |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |doi=10.1177/2167702612468111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Maryland evaluated participants ability to accurately recall two sets of familiar faces, using a traditional desktop, and with a head-mounted display. The study was designed to leverage the method of loci technique, with virtual environments resembling memory palaces. The study found an 8.8% recall improvement in favor of the head-mounted display, in part due to participants being able to leverage their vestibular and proprioceptive sensations.&lt;ref name="EKrokos"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Krokos|first=Eric|last2=Plaisant|first2=Catherine|last3=Varshney|first3=Amitabh |date=16 May 2018|title=Virtual Memory Palaces: Immersion Aids Recall|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with [[elaborative encoding]] (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium Passages on Memory|first=Douglas Boin/Karl|last=Galinsky|date=|website=www.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/quintillian-on-memory-109.html|title=Quintilian on Memory - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=25 November 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.

A variation of the "method of loci" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bremer| first = Rod| title =The Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM)| publisher =  Fons Sapientiae Publishing | date = September 20, 2011| location = Cambridge, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0956990709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/memory-techniques-brazilian-portuguese-795.html|title=New Project: Use Memory Techniques to Learn Brazilian Portuguese - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=18 December 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something that is likely a reference to the "method of loci" techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finger| first =Stanley| title =Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = October 11, 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 333 | isbn = 978-0195146943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/first-place-second-place-5806.html|title="In the First Place, in the Second Place" - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=12 January 2015|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot [[Timothy Doner]] described in his 2014 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donor|first1=Timothy|title=Breaking the language barrier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book "How to learn and memorise German vocabulary". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.

==Applicability of the term==
The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the [[art of memory]], [[Art of memory#Origins and history|the origins of which are related]], according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]] and the collapsing banquet hall.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from [[The Art of Memory|Frances Yates]]) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the [[art of memory]]. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gutman| first =Sharon A.| title =Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals| publisher = SLACK Incorporated| date = December 1, 2007 |location =Thorofare, New Jersey| pages = 216| isbn =978-1556428005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the [[art of memory]], hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.

== Spatial mnemonics and specific brain activation ==

Brain scans of "superior memorizers", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the [[Parietal lobe|medial parietal cortex]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], and the [[Hippocampus|right posterior hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation.  In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.

In a classic study in cognitive [[neuroscience]], O'Keefe and Nadel proposed "that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated."&lt;ref This theory has generated considerable debate and further experiment. It has been noted that "[t]he hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal [[neurons]] supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fictional portrayals ==
Fictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myths]]. The method of loci also features prominently in the [[BBC]] series  ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in which the titular main character uses a "mind palace" to store information. In the original [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] stories, [[Sherlock Holmes]] referred to his [[brain]] as an [[attic]].&lt;ref name="Zielinski18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=The Secrets of Sherlock’s Mind Palace|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/secrets-sherlocks-mind-palace-180949567/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Smithsonian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], a detailed description of [[Hannibal Lecter]]'s memory palace is provided.&lt;ref name="harris-thomas-hanibal-rising"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris|first=Thomas|year=2006|title=[[Hannibal Rising]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|isbn=0385339410|pages=1-2,167,178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinez-conde-susana-sciam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez-Conde|first=Susana|title=Neuroscience in Fiction: Hannibal Lecter's Memory Palace|date=April 26, 2013|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mittag-Leffler Institute''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] research institute located in [[Djursholm]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]]. It invites scholars to participate in year-long or half-year programs in specialized mathematical subjects. The Institute is run by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] on behalf of research societies representing all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.

The Institute's main building was originally the residence of [[Magnus Gustaf (Gösta) Mittag-Leffler]], who donated it along with his extensive mathematics library. At his death in 1927, however, Mittag-Leffler's fortune was insufficient to set up an active research institute, which began operation only in 1969 under the leadership of [[Lennart Carleson]].

The journals [[Acta Mathematica]] and [[Arkiv för Matematik]] are published by the institute. For a number of years at the beginning of the 20th century, Mittag's villa hosted a celebratory dinner for [[Nobel Prize]] laureates.

==Notable visitors==

Each year the institute invites the best mathematician in their fields to work on specific mathematical themes. Some notable past visitors include:

[[Louis Billera]], [[Sy Friedman]], [[John B. Garnett]], [[Roger Heath-Brown]], [[Sigurður Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurður Helgason]], [[Helge Holden]], [[Harry Kesten]], [[Donald Knuth]], [[George Lusztig]], [[Paul Malliavin]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], [[Lynn Steen]], [[André Weil]], [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], [[Günter M. Ziegler]], [[Kenneth Falconer (mathematician)|Kenneth Falconer]].

'''Music examinations''' are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of pupils learning [[musical instruments]]. These are called grades.

Although there are music [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s available to [[school]] and [[university]] students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability which are open to all.

[[Trinity College London]] was the first organization to offer examinations in music to external students in 1877. As of 2012, Trinity College London conducts around 600,000 assessments worldwide per year, as does the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]]. Other examination boards based in the UK include the [[London College of Music Examinations|London College of Music]], [[Victoria College of Music and Drama]], the [[National College of Music]] and [[RSL (Rockschool Ltd.)|Rockschool]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rslawards.com/rockschool/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many students who enter these exams have taken a course of [[music lesson]]s with a private tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children to receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place of learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to music later in life.

Music exams are set in both [[music theory|theory]] and practical aspects. The theory examinations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas such as [[musical notation]], construction of [[major scale|scales]] and [[musical composition|composition]].

The practical exams concentrate on the particular instrument favored by the pupil, for example [[piano]], [[guitar]] or [[flute]]. They cover elements such as playing set pieces, technical work including [[Musical scale|scales]], [[sight reading]], aural, musical knowledge and improvisation.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the music exams are graded from 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being the entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher study in a music college. Additionally, Trinity College London offers an Initial level qualification at Entry Level 3 of the UK Qualifications and Credit Framework, and ABRSM offer a Prep Test qualification as a useful preparation before the Grade 1 exam. LCM offers two Step exams at this level and VCM offers four Introductory grades aimed at those in the first 18 months of learning.

Other reputable music examination boards offering examinations on musical instruments and music theory include:
* [[Australian Music Examinations Board]]
* New Zealand Music Examinations Board
* Guitarmonk Examination Board, India
* Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra (Board of music and fine arts education), India
* [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]], Canada
* [[University of South Africa]] - Directorate Music
* Vienna Music Examination Board (''Wiener Musik-Prüfungskommission'')

Different music examination boards may have different grade levels for instruments and music theory examination. Depending on how they are recognised by regulatory bodies such as Ofqual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/ Ofqual]&lt;/ref&gt;, examination results or credits may be transferable from one exam board to the other.

A '''natural region''' is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a [[region]] which is distinguished by its common natural features of [[geography]], [[geology]], and [[climate]]. 

From the [[ecology|ecological]] point of view, the naturally occurring flora and fauna of the region are likely to be influenced by its geographical and geological factors, such as [[soil]] and [[water resources|water availability]], in a significant manner. Thus most natural regions are homogeneous [[ecosystem]]s. Human impact can be an important factor in the shaping and destiny of a particular natural region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1739/ UNESCO - Natural and Cultural Landscape of Danube Region]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 11 major regions in the world.

The concept "natural region" may refer to a large, poor area, or to a large basic geographical unit, like the vast [[boreal forest]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/natural-regions Natural Regions - The Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also be used generically, like in [[alpine tundra]], or specifically to refer to a particular place.

The term is particularly useful where there is no corresponding or coterminous official region. [[The Fens]] of eastern [[England]], the [[Thai highlands]], and the [[Pays de Bray]] in Normandy, are examples of this. Others might include regions with particular geological characteristics, like [[badlands]], such as the [[Bardenas Reales]], an upland [[massif]] of acidic rock, or [[The Burren]], in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9352">'''Network planning and design''' is an iterative process, encompassing 
[[#A network planning methodology|topological design]], [[#A network planning methodology|network-synthesis]], and [[#A network planning methodology|network-realization]], and is aimed at ensuring that a new [[telecommunications network]] or service meets the needs of the subscriber and [[network operator|operator]].&lt;ref name="[1]"&gt;Penttinen A., ''Chapter 10 – Network Planning and Dimensioning, Lecture Notes: S-38.145 - Introduction to [[Teletraffic]] Theory'', Helsinki University of Technology, Fall 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
The process can be tailored according to each new network or service.&lt;ref name="[*]"&gt;Farr R.E., ''Telecommunications Traffic, Tariffs and Costs – An Introduction For Managers'', Peter Peregrinus Ltd,  1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A network planning methodology==
A traditional network planning methodology in the context of business decisions involves five layers of planning, namely:

* need assessment and resource assessment 
* short-term network planning 
* IT resource 
* long-term and medium-term network planning
* operations and maintenance.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;
Each of these layers incorporates plans for different time horizons, i.e. the business planning layer determines the planning that the operator must perform to ensure that the network will perform as required for its intended life-span. The Operations and Maintenance layer, however, examines how the network will run on a day-to-day basis.

The network planning process begins with the acquisition of external information. This includes:

* forecasts of how the new network/service will operate;
* the economic information concerning costs; and 
* the technical details of the network’s capabilities.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;&lt;ref name="[*]" /&gt;

Planning a new network/service involves implementing the new system across the first four layers of the [[OSI Model|OSI Reference Model]].&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt; Choices must be made for the [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s and transmission technologies.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;&lt;ref name="[*]" /&gt;

Network planning process involves three main steps:

* '''Topological design''': This stage involves determining where to place the components and how to connect them. The ([[network topology|topological]]) optimisation methods that can be used in this stage come from an area of mathematics called [[Graph Theory]]. These methods involve determining the costs of transmission and the cost of switching, and thereby determining the optimum [[connection matrix]] and location of switches and concentrators.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;
* '''Network-synthesis''': This stage involves determining the size of the components used, subject to [[performance criterion|performance criteria]] such as the [[Grade of service|Grade of Service]] (GOS). The method used is known as "Nonlinear Optimisation", and involves determining the topology, required GoS, cost of transmission, etc., and using this information to calculate a routing plan, and the size of the components.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;
* '''Network realization''': This stage involves determining how to meet capacity requirements, and ensure reliability within the network. The method used is known as "Multicommodity Flow Optimisation", and involves determining all information relating to demand, costs and reliability, and then using this information to calculate an actual physical circuit plan.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;

These steps are performed iteratively in parallel with one another.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;&lt;ref name="[*]" /&gt;

==The role of forecasting==

During the process of Network Planning and Design, estimates are made of the expected [[traffic intensity]] and [[Network congestion|traffic load]] that the network must support.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt; If a network of a similar nature already exists, [[Traffic measurement (telecommunications)|traffic measurements]] of such a network can be used to calculate the exact traffic load.&lt;ref name="[*]" /&gt; If there are no similar networks, then the network planner must use [[telecommunications forecasting]] methods to estimate the expected traffic intensity.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;

The forecasting process involves several steps:&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;

* Definition of problem;
* Data acquisition;
* Choice of forecasting method;
* Analysis/Forecasting;
* Documentation and analysis of results.

==Dimensioning==&lt;!-- [[Overprovisioning]] redirects here --&gt;
Dimensioning a new network determines the minimum capacity requirements that will still allow the [[Teletraffic Grade of Service]] (GoS) requirements to be met.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;&lt;ref name="[*]" /&gt; To do this, dimensioning involves planning for peak-hour traffic, i.e. that hour during the day during which traffic intensity is at its peak.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;

The dimensioning process involves determining the network’s topology, routing plan, traffic [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and GoS requirements, and using this information to determine the maximum call handling capacity of the [[network switch|switches]], and the maximum number of channels required between the switches.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt; This process requires a complex model that simulates the behavior of the network equipment and [[routing protocol]]s.

A dimensioning rule is that the planner must ensure that the traffic load should never approach a load of 100 percent.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt; To calculate the correct dimensioning to comply with the above rule, the planner must take on-going measurements of the network’s traffic, and continuously maintain and upgrade resources to meet the changing requirements.&lt;ref name="[1]"/&gt;&lt;ref name="[*]" /&gt; Another reason for '''overprovisioning''' is to make sure that traffic can be rerouted in case a failure occurs in the network.

Because of the complexity of network dimensioning, this is typically done using specialized software tools. Whereas researchers typically develop custom software to study a particular problem, network operators typically make use of commercial network planning software.

==Traffic engineering==
Compared to network engineering, which adds resources such as links, routers and switches into the network, traffic engineering targets changing traffic paths on the existing network to alleviate traffic congestion or accommodate more traffic demand.

This technology is critical when the cost of network expansion is prohibitively high and network load is not optimally balanced.  The first part provides financial motivation for traffic engineering while the second part grants the possibility of deploying this technology.

==Survivability==
Network survivability enables the network to maintain maximum network connectivity and quality of service under failure conditions. It has been one of the critical requirements in network planning and design. It involves design requirements on topology, protocol, bandwidth allocation, etc..  Topology requirement can be maintaining a minimum two-connected network against any failure of a single link or node.  Protocol requirements include using dynamic routing protocol to reroute traffic against network dynamics during the transition of network dimensioning or equipment failures.  Bandwidth allocation requirements pro-actively allocate extra bandwidth to avoid traffic loss under failure conditions.  This topic has been actively studied in conferences, such as the International Workshop on Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1002110 International Workshop on Design of Reliable Communication Networks, DRCN]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data driven network design==
More recently, with the increasing role of Artificial Intelligence technologies in engineering, the idea of using data to create data driven models of existing networks has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-016-3242-8 C. Fortuna, E. De Poorter, P. Škraba, I. Moerman, Data Driven Wireless Network Design: A Multi-level Modeling Approach, Wireless Personal Communications, May 2016, Volume 88, Issue 1, pp 63–77.]&lt;/ref&gt;. By analyzing large network data, also the less desired behaviors that may occur in a real-world networks can be understood, worked around and avoided in future designs. 

Both the design and management of networked systems can be improved by data-driven paradigm &lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67235-9_9 J. Jiang, V. Sekar, I. Stoica, H. Zhang, Unleashing the Potential of Data-Driven Networking, Springer LNCS vol LNCS, volume 10340, September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. Data driven models can also be used at various phases of service and network management life cycle such as: service instantiation, service provision, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic &lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-wu-model-driven-management-virtualization-00.html An Architecture for Data Model Driven Network Management: the Network Virtualization Case, IETF draft.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Tools==
There are a wide variety of tools available for network planning and design depending on the technologies being used. These include:

* [[OPNET]]
* [[NetSim]]

The nervous system in vertebrates is made up of two major types of cells – [[Neuroglia|neuroglial cells]] and [[neuron]]s. Hundreds of different types of neurons exist in humans, with varying functions – some of them process external stimuli; others generate a response to stimuli; others organize in centralized structures ([[brain]], [[Ganglia, spinal|spinal ganglia]]) that are responsible for cognition, perception, and regulation of motor functions. Neurons in these centralized locations tend to organize in giant networks and communicate extensively with each other. Prior to the availability of [[Gene expression profiling|expression arrays]] and [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequencing methodologies]], researchers sought to understand the cellular behaviour of neurons (including [[Synapse|synapse formation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and neuronal development and regionalization in the human nervous system) in terms of the underlying molecular biology and biochemistry, without any understanding of the influence of a neuron’s genome on its development and behaviour. As our understanding of the genome has expanded, the role of networks of gene interactions in the maintenance of neuronal function and behaviour has garnered interest in the [[neuroscience]] research community. Neurogenomics allows scientists to study the nervous system of organisms in the context of these underlying regulatory and transcriptional networks. This approach is distinct from [[neurogenetics]], which emphasizes the role of single genes without a network-interaction context when studying the nervous system.&lt;ref name="Jain 7–16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neurogenetics and Neurogenomics|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-62703-272-8_2|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781627032711|pages = 7–16|language = en|first = Kewal K.|last = Jain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Cirelli &amp; Tononi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differences in gene expression during sleep and wakefulness|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/07853899908998787|journal = Annals of Medicine|pages = 117–124|volume = 31|issue = 2|doi = 10.3109/07853899908998787|first = Chiara|last = Cirelli|first2 = Giulio|last2 = Tononi}}&lt;/ref&gt; first reported the association of genome-wide brain gene expression profiling (using [[microarray]]s) with a behavioural phenotype in mice.

Probes can also have species-specific binding affinities that can confound comparative analysis.

Notably, the association between behavioural patterns and high [[penetrance]] single [[Gene locus|gene loci]] falls under the purview of [[neurogenetics]] research, wherein the focus is to identify a simple causative relationship between a single, high penetrance gene and an observed function/behaviour.  However, it has been shown that several neurological diseases tend to be [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]], being influenced by multiple different [[gene]]s and [[regulatory regions]] instead of one gene alone. There has hence been a shift from single gene approaches to network approaches for studying neurological development and diseases, a shift that has been greatly propelled by the advent of [[next generation sequencing]] methodologies.

However, linkage studies have largely failed at identifying causative variants for psychiatric disorders such as these, primarily because of their complex genetic architecture. Multiple low penetrance [[Risk allele|risk variants]] can be aggregated in affected individuals and families, and sets of causative variants could vary across families.

With the availability of massively parallel [[next generation sequencing]] methodologies, scientists have been able to look beyond the probe based captures of expressed genes. [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]], for example, identifies 25-60% more expressed genes than microarrays do. In the upcoming field of neurogenomics, it is hoped that by understanding the genomic profiles of different parts of the brain, we might be able to improve our understanding of how the interactions between genes and pathways influence cellular function and development. This approach is expected to be able to identify the secondary gene networks that are disrupted in neurological disorders, subsequently assisting drug development stratagems for brain diseases.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Opinion: The Present and Future of Neurogenomics {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36028/title/Opinion--The-Present-and-Future-of-Neurogenomics/|website = The Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BRAIN Initiative|BRAIN initiative]] launched in 2013, for example, seeks to "''inform the development of future treatments for brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury''"  .

Additionally, these mutations are not statistically enriched in individual genes, but rather, exhibit patterns of statistical enrichment in groups of genes associated with networks regulating neurological development and maintenance. Such a discovery would have been impossible with prior gene-centric approaches ([[neurogenetics]], [[Behavioral neuroscience|behavioural neuroscience]]). Neurogenomics allows for a high-throughput system-based approach for understanding the [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]] basis of [[Neuropsychiatric disorder|neuropsychiatric]] disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Imaging studies and optical mapping===
When [[autism]] was identified as a distinct biological disorder in the 1980s, researchers found that autistic individuals showed a brain growth abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] in their early developmental years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hypoplasia of cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII in autism|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1988-05-26|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 3367935|pages = 1349–1354|volume = 318|issue = 21|doi = 10.1056/NEJM198805263182102|first = E.|last = Courchesne|first2 = R.|last2 = Yeung-Courchesne|first3 = G. A.|last3 = Press|first4 = J. R.|last4 = Hesselink|first5 = T. L.|last5 = Jernigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has indicated that 90% of autistic children have a larger brain volume than their peers by 2 to 4 years of age, and show an expansion in the white and gray matter content in the [[cerebrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unusual brain growth patterns in early life in patients with autistic disorder: an MRI study|journal = Neurology|date = 2001-07-24|issn = 0028-3878|pmid = 11468308|pages = 245–254|volume = 57|issue = 2|first = E.|last = Courchesne|first2 = C.

These findings highlighted the influence of structural variance in the brain on psychiatric disorders, and have motivated the use of imaging technologies to map regions of divergence between healthy and diseased brains. Furthermore, while it may not always be possible to retrieve biological specimens from different areas live human brains, [[neuroimaging]] techniques offer a noninvasive means to understanding the biological basis of neurological disorders. It is hoped that an understanding of localization patterns of different psychiatric diseases could in turn inform network analysis studies in neurogenomics.

====MRI====
[[Magnetic resonance imaging|Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) can be used to identify the structural composition of the brain. Particularly in the context of neurogenomics, MRI has played an extensive role in the study of [[Alzheimer's disease]](AD) over the past four decades. It was initially used to rule out other causes of [[dementia]],&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent studies indicated the presence of characteristic changes in patients with AD. As a result, MRI scans are currently being used as a neuroimaging tool to help identify the temporal and spatial pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, such as specific cerebral alterations and [[amyloid imaging]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The ease and non-invasive nature of MRI scans has motivated research projects that trace the development and onset of psychiatric diseases in the brain. Alzheimer disease has become a key candidate in this topographical approach to psychiatric diseases. For example, MRI scans are currently being used to track the resting and task-dependent functional profiles of brains in children with autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain Imaging and Blood Biomarker Abnormalities in Children With Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal = JAMA Neurology|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 2168-6157|pmc = 4625544|pmid = 26121081|pages = 912–919|volume = 72|issue = 8|doi = 10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.1099|first = Yakeel T.|last = Quiroz|first2 = Aaron P.|last2 = Schultz|first3 = Kewei|last3 = Chen|first4 = Hillary D.|last4 = Protas|first5 = Michael|last5 = Brickhouse|first6 = Adam S.|last6 = Fleisher|first7 = Jessica B.|last7 = Langbaum|first8 = Pradeep|last8 = Thiyyagura|first9 = Anne M.|last9 = Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have found indications of early onset brain alterations in at-risk individuals for AD.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Autism Center of Excellence at University of California, San Diego, is also conducting MRI studies with children between 12 and 42 months, in the hopes of characterizing brain development abnormalities in children who present behavioural symptoms of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence|url = https://autism-center.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx|website = autism-center.ucsd.edu|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional research has indicated that there are specifics patterns of [[atrophy]] in the cerebrum (as a repercussion of [[neurodegeneration]]) in different neurological disorders and diseases. These disease-specific patterns of progression of atrophy can be identified with MRI scans, and provide a clinical phenotype context to neurogenomic research. The temporal information about disease progression provided by this approach can also potentially inform the interpretation of gene network-level perturbations in psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Optical mapping ====
One prohibitive feature of 2nd generation sequencing methodologies is the upper limit on the genomic range accessible by [[Whole genome sequencing|mate-pairing.]] [[Optical mapping]] is an emerging methodology used to span large-scale variants that cannot usually be detected using paired end reads. This approach has been successfully applied to detect [[Structural variation|structural variants]] in [[oligodendroglioma]], a type of brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Discovery of structural alterations in solid tumor oligodendroglioma by single molecule analysis|url = http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-505|journal = BMC Genomics|date = 2013-07-26|pmc = 3727977|pmid = 23885787|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-14-505|language = En|first = Mohana|last = Ray|first2 = Steve|last2 = Goldstein|first3 = Shiguo|last3 = Zhou|first4 = Konstantinos|last4 = Potamousis|first5 = Deepayan|last5 = Sarkar|first6 = Michael A|last6 = Newton|first7 = Elizabeth|last7 = Esterberg|first8 = Christina|last8 = Kendziorski|first9 = Oliver|last9 = Bogler|pages=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has also highlighted the versatility of optical maps in improving existing genome assemblies. [[Chromosomal rearrangement]]s, [[microdeletion]]s, and large-scale [[translocations]] have been associated with impaired neurological and [[cognitive function]], for example in hereditary [[Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa|neuropathy]] and [[neurofibromatosis]]. Optical mapping can significantly improve variant detection and inform gene interaction network models for the diseased state in neurological disorders.

==== Studying other brain diseases ====
Apart from neurological disorders, there are additional diseases that manifest in the brain and have formed exemplar use-case scenarios for the application of brain imaging in network analysis. In a classic example of imaging-genomic analyses, a research study in 2012 compared MRI scans and gene expression profiles of 104 glioma patients in order to distinguish treatment outcomes and identify novel targetable genomic pathways in [[Glioblastoma multiforme|Glioblastoma Multiforme]] (GBM). Researchers found two distinct groups of patients with significantly different organization of [[white matter]] (invasive vs non-invasive). Subsequent pathway analysis of the gene expression data indicated mitochondrial dysfunction as the top canonical pathway in an aggressive, low-mortality GBM phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Imaging genomic mapping of an invasive MRI phenotype predicts patient outcome and metabolic dysfunction: a TCGA glioma phenotype research group project|journal = BMC Medical Genomics|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1755-8794|pmc = 4057583|pmid = 24889866|pages = 30|volume = 7|doi = 10.1186/1755-8794-7-30|first = Rivka R.|last = Colen|first2 = Mark|last2 = Vangel|first3 = Jixin|last3 = Wang|first4 = David A.|last4 = Gutman|first5 = Scott N.|last5 = Hwang|first6 = Max|last6 = Wintermark|first7 = Rajan|last7 = Jain|first8 = Manal|last8 = Jilwan-Nicolas|first9 = James Y.|last9 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of brain imaging approaches to other diseases can be used to rule out other medical illnesses while diagnosing psychiatric disorders, but cannot be used to inform the presence or absence of a psychiatric disorder.

== Research developmental models ==

=== In humans ===
The current approaches in collecting gene expression data in human brains are to use either [[microarray]]s or [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]]. Currently, it is rare to gather "live" brain tissue – only when treatments involve brain surgery is there a chance that brain tissue is collected during the procedure. This is the case with epilepsy.

Currently, gene expression data is usually collected on post mortem brains and this is often a barrier to neurogenomics research in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Since RNA degrades after death, a fresh brain is optimal – but not always available. This in turn can influence a variety of downstream analyses.

* The cause of death is also an important variable to consider in the collection of human brain samples for the purposes of neurogenomics research. For example, brain samples of individuals with clinical [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]] are often collected after suicide. Certain conditions of death, such as drug overdose or self-inflicted gunshot, will alter the expression of the brain. 
* Another issue with studying gene expression in brains is the cellular heterogeneity of brain tissue samples. Bulk brain samples may vary in proportions of specific cell populations from case to case. This can impact the gene expression signatures and may significantly change differential expression analysis.

===Animal models===
Ongoing genomics research in neurological disorders tends to use animal models (and corresponding [[Homologous chromosome|gene homologs]]) to understand the network interactions underlying a particular disorder due to ethical issues surrounding the retrieval of biological specimens from live human brains. This, too, is not without its roadblocks.

Neurogenomic research with a model organism is contingent on the availability of a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Additionally, the RNA profiles ([[MicroRNA|miRNA]], [[Non-coding RNA|ncRNA]], [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]) of the model organism need to be well catalogued, and any inferences applied from them to humans must have a basis in functional/sequence [[Homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Experimental mice models for psychiatric disorders ====
A common approach to using a mouse model is to apply an experimental treatment to a pregnant mouse in order to affect a whole litter. However, a key issue in the field is the treatment of litters in a statistical analysis. Most studies consider the total number of offspring produced as that may lead to an increase in statistical power. However, the correct way is to count by the number of litters and to normalize based on litter size. It was found that several autism studies incorrectly performed their statistical analyses based on total number of offspring instead of number of litters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several anxiety disorders such as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) involve [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] changes in several different brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[nucleus accumbens]]. The cellular encoding of traumatic events and the behavioral responses triggered by such events has been shown to lie primarily in changes in signaling molecules associated with [[synaptic transmission]].

Global [[gene expression profiling]] of the various gene regions implicated in fear and anxiety processing, using mice models, has led to the identification of temporally and spatially distinct sets of differentially expressed genes. Pathway analysis of these genes has indicated possible roles in [[neurogenesis]] and anxiety-related behavioural responses, alongside other functional and phenotypic observations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Mice models for brain research have contributed significantly to [[drug development]] and increased our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of several neurological diseases in the last generation. [[Chlorpromazine]], the first [[antipsychotic]] drug (discovered in 1951), was identified as a viable treatment option after it was shown to suppress response to aversive stimuli in rats in a behavioural screen.

==== Challenges ====
The modelling and assessment of latent symptoms (thoughts, verbal learning, social interactions, cognitive behaviour) remains a challenge when using model organisms to study [[psychiatric disorders]] with a complex genetic [[pathology]]. For example, a given genotype+phenotype in a mouse model must imitate the genomic underpinnings of a phenotype observed in a human.

This is a particularly crucial item of consideration in spectrum disorders such as [[autism]]. Autism is a disorder whose symptoms can be divided into two categories: (i) deficits of social interactions and (ii) repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. Since mice tend to be more social creatures amongst all members of the order ''[[Rodent]]ia'' currently being used as model organisms, mice are generally used to model human psychiatric disorders as closely as possible. Particularly for autism, the following work-arounds are currently in place to emulate human behavioural symptoms:
* For the first diagnostic category of impaired social behaviour, mice are subject to a social assay intended to represent typical autistic social deficits. Normal social behaviour for mice includes sniffing, following, physical contact and [[allogrooming]]. Vocal communication could be used as well. 
* There are a number of ways the second diagnostic category can be observed in mice. Examples of repetitive behaviours can include excessive circling, self-grooming and excessive digging. Usually these behaviours would be performed consistently within a long measurement of time (i.e. self-grooming for 10 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** While repetitive behaviours are easily observable, it is difficult to characterize actual restricted interests of mice. One aspect of restricted interests of autistic individuals is the "insistence of sameness"—the concept that autistic individuals require their environment to remain consistent. If that environment should change, the individual would experience stress and anxiety. There has been reported success in confirming a mouse model of autism by changing the mouse’s environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In any of these experiments, the ‘autistic’ mice have a ‘normal’ socializing partner and the scientists observing the mice is unaware/'''blind''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' to the genotypes of the mice.

==Gene expression in the brain==
The gene expression profile of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) is unique. Eighty percent of all human genes are expressed in the brain; 5,000 of these genes are solely expressed in the CNS. The human brain has the highest amount of gene expression of all studied mammalian brains. In comparison, tissues outside of the brain will have more similar expression levels in comparison to their mammalian counterparts. One source of the increased expression levels in the human brain is from the non-protein coding region of the genome. Numerous studies have indicated that the human brain have a higher level of expression in regulatory regions in comparison to other mammalian brains. There is also notable enrichment for more [[alternative splicing]] events in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Jain 7–16"/&gt;

===Spatial differences===
Gene expression profiles also vary within specific regions of the brain. A [[Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization|microarray study]] showed that the transcriptome profile of the CNS clusters together based on region. A different study characterized the regulation of gene expression across 10 different regions based on their [[Expression quantitative trait loci|eQTL]] signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic variability in the regulation of gene expression in ten regions of the human brain|url = http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n10/full/nn.3801.html|journal = Nature Neuroscience|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 1097-6256|pmc = 4208299|pmid = 25174004|pages = 1418–1428|volume = 17|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/nn.3801|language = en|first = Adaikalavan|last = Ramasamy|first2 = Daniah|last2 = Trabzuni|first3 = Sebastian|last3 = Guelfi|first4 = Vibin|last4 = Varghese|first5 = Colin|last5 = Smith|first6 = Robert|last6 = Walker|first7 = Tisham|last7 = De|last8 = UK Brain Expression Consortium|last9 = North American Brain Expression Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the varying expression profiles relates to function, [[neuron migration]] and cellular heterogeneity of the region.

The researchers sequenced 36 neurons from the cerebral cortex of three normal individuals, and found that highly expressed genes, and neural associated genes, were significantly enriched for single-neuron [[Single nucleotide variants|SNVs]]. These SNVs, in turn, were found to be correlated with chromatin markers of transcription from fetal brain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Somatic mutation in single human neurons tracks developmental and transcriptional history|journal = Science|date = 2015-10-02|issn = 1095-9203|pmc = 4664477|pmid = 26430121|pages = 94–98|volume = 350|issue = 6256|doi = 10.1126/science.aab1785|first = Michael A.|last = Lodato|first2 = Mollie B.|last2 = Woodworth|first3 = Semin|last3 = Lee|first4 = Gilad D.|last4 = Evrony|first5 = Bhaven K.|last5 = Mehta|first6 = Amir|last6 = Karger|first7 = Soohyun|last7 = Lee|first8 = Thomas W.|last8 = Chittenden|first9 = Alissa M.|last9 = D'Gama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development patterns in humans===
Gene expression of the brain changes throughout the different phases of life. The most significant levels of expression are found during early development, with the rate of gene expression being highest during fetal development. This results from the rapid growth of neurons in the embryo. Neurons at this stage are undergoing [[Neuron|neuronal differentiation]], [[cell proliferation]], migration events and dendritic and [[Synapse|synaptic development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v508/n7495/full/nature13185.html|journal = Nature|date = 2014-04-10|issn = 0028-0836|pmc = 4105188|pmid = 24695229|pages = 199–206|volume = 508|issue = 7495|doi = 10.1038/nature13185|language = en|first = Jeremy A.|last = Miller|first2 = Song-Lin|last2 = Ding|first3 = Susan M.|last3 = Sunkin|first4 = Kimberly A.|last4 = Smith|first5 = Lydia|last5 = Ng|first6 = Aaron|last6 = Szafer|first7 = Amanda|last7 = Ebbert|first8 = Zackery L.|last8 = Riley|first9 = Joshua J.|last9 = Royall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene expression patterns shift closer towards specialized functional functional profiles during embryonic development, however, certain developmental steps are still ongoing at parturition. Consequently, gene expression profiles of the two brain hemispheres appear asymmetrical at birth. At birth, gene expression profiles appear asymmetrical between [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]]. As development continues, the gene expression profiles become similar between the hemispheres.  Given a healthy adult, expression profiles stay relatively consistent from the late twenties into the late forties. From the fifties onwards, there is significant decrease in the expression of genes important for regular function. Despite this, there is an increase in the diversity of genes being expressed across the brain. This age related change in expression may be correlated with [[GC-content|GC content]]. At later stages of life, there is an increase in the induction of low GC-content pivotal genes as well as an increase in the repression of high GC-content pivotal genes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another cause of the shift in gene diversity is the accumulation of mutations and DNA damage. Gene expression studies show that genes that accrue these age-related mutations are consistent between individuals in the aging population. Genes that are highly expressed at development decrease significantly at late stages in life, whereas genes that are highly repressed at development increase significantly at the late stages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sequence data is used to understand the evolutionary genetic changes which led to the development of the human CNS. We can then understand how the neurological phenotypes differ between species. [[Comparative genomics]] entails comparison of sequence data across a [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] to pinpoint the genotypic changes that occur within specific lineages, and understand how these changes might have arisen. The increase in high quality mammalian reference sequences generally makes [[Qualitative comparative analysis|comparative analysis]] better as it increases [[statistical power]]. However, the increase in number of species in a [[phylogeny]] does risk adding unnecessary noise as the alignments of the [[Orthologous gene|orthologous]] sequences usually decrease in quality. Furthermore, different classes of species will have significant differences in their phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Geschwind 633–647"&gt;{{Cite journal

Despite this, comparative genomics has allowed us to connect the genetic changes found in a phylogeny to specific pathways. In order to determine this, lineages are tested for the functional changes that accrue over time. This is often measured as a ratio of [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s to [[synonymous substitution]]s or the [[dN/dS ratio]] (sometimes, further abbreviated to ω). When the dN/dS ratio is greater than 1, this indicates [[positive selection]]. A dN/dS ratio equal to 1 is evidence of no selective pressures. A dN/dS ratio less than 1 indicates [[negative selection (artificial selection)|negative selection]]. For example, the conserved regions of the genome will generally have a dN/dS ratio of less than 1 since any changes to those positions will likely be detrimental.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal

Understanding the significance of the [[positive selection]] is generally the next step. For example, ''[[ASPM (gene)|ASPM]]'', ''[[CDK5RAP2]]'' and ''[[NIN (gene)|NIN]]'' are genes that are positively selected for on the human lineage and have been directly correlated with brain size. This finding may help elucidate why human brains are larger than other mammalian brains.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Network level expression differences between species ===
It is thought that gene expression changes, being the ultimate response for any genetic changes, are a good proxy for understanding [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences within biological samples. Comparative studies have revealed a range of differences in the [[Transcriptional regulation|transcriptional controls]] between [[primate]]s and [[rodent]]s. For example, the gene ''[[CNTNAP2]]'' is specifically enriched for in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The mouse homolog of ''CNTNAP2'' is not expressed in the mouse brain. ''CNTNAP2'' has been implicated in cognitive functions of language as well as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. This suggests that the control of expression plays a significant role in the development in unique human cognitive function.  As a consequence, a number of studies have investigated the brain specific enhancers. [[Transcription factor]]s such as ''[[SOX5]]'' have been found to be positively selected for on the human lineage. Gene expression studies in humans, [[chimpanzee]]s and [[rhesus macaque]]s, have identified human specific co-expression networks, and an elevation in gene expression in the human cortex in comparison to primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decoding human gene expression signatures in the brain|journal = Transcription|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 2154-1272|pmc = 4042582|pmid = 23665540|pages = 102–108|volume = 4|issue = 3|first = Guang-Zhong|last = Wang|first2 = Genevieve|last2 = Konopka|doi=10.4161/trns.24885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders==

Neurogenomic disorders manifest themselves as [[neurological disorder]]s with a complex genetic architecture and a [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-Mendelian]]-like pattern of inheritance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Some examples of these disorders include [[Bipolar disorder]] and [[Schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several genes may be involved in the manifestation of the disorder, and mutations in such disorders are generally rare and ''de novo.'' Hence it becomes extremely unlikely to observe the same (potentially causative) variant in two unrelated individuals affected with the same neurogenomic disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ongoing research has implicated several ''[[De novo mutation|de novo]]'' exonic variations and structural variations in [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD), for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[allelic spectrum]] of the rare and common variants in neurogenomic disorders therefore necessitates a need for large cohort studies in order to effectively exclude low effect variants and identify the overarching pathways frequently mutated in the different disorders, rather than specific genes and specific [[High-penetrance|high penetrance]] mutations.

[[Whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) and [[whole exome sequencing]] (WES) has been used in [[Genome-wide association study|Genome Wide Association Studies]] (GWAS) to  characterize genetic variants associated with neurogenomic disorders. However, the impact of these variants cannot always be verified because of the non-Mendelian inheritance patterns observed in several of these disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another prohibitive feature in network analysis is the lack of large-scale datasets for many psychiatric (neurogenomic) diseases. Since several diseases with neurogenomic underpinnings tend to have a [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]] basis, several nonspecific, rare, and partially penetrant ''de novo'' mutations in different patients can contribute to the same observed range of phenotypes, as is the case with Autism Spectrum Disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Modelling psychiatric disorders in neurogenomics research – issues ===
One major [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] study identified 13 new risk loci for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genome-wide association analysis identifies 13 new risk loci for schizophrenia|journal = Nature Genetics|date = 2013-10-01|issn = 1546-1718|pmc = 3827979|pmid = 23974872|pages = 1150–1159|volume = 45|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ng.2742|first = Stephan|last = Ripke|first2 = Colm|last2 = O'Dushlaine|first3 = Kimberly|last3 = Chambert|first4 = Jennifer L.|last4 = Moran|first5 = Anna K.|last5 = Kähler|first6 = Susanne|last6 = Akterin|first7 = Sarah E.|last7 = Bergen|first8 = Ann L.|last8 = Collins|first9 = James J.|last9 = Crowley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the impact of these candidates would ideally demonstrate a schizophrenia phenotype in animal models, which is usually difficult to observe due to its manifestation as a latent personality. This approach is able to determine the molecular impact the [[candidate gene]]. Ideally the candidate genes would have a neurological impact, which in turn would suggest that it plays a role in the neurological disorder. For example, in the aforementioned schizophrenia GWAS study, Ripke and colleagues&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; determined that these candidate genes were all involved in calcium signalling. Alternatively, one can study these variants in model organisms in the context of affected neurological function. It is important to note that the [[High-penetrance|high penetrance]] variants of these disorders tend to be ''de novo'' mutations.

A further complication to studying neurogenomic disorders is the heterogeneous nature of the disorder. In many of these disorders, the mutations observed from case to case do not stay consistent. In autism, an affected individual may experience a large amount of deleterious mutations in gene X. A different affected individual may not have any significant mutations on gene X but have a large amount of mutations in gene Y. The alternative is to determine if gene X and gene Y impact the same biochemical pathway—one that influences a neurological function. A bioinformatics network analysis is one approach to this problem. Network analyses methodologies provide a generalized, systems overview of a molecular pathway.

One final complication to consider is the comorbidity of neurogenomic genes. Several disorders, especially at the more severe ends of the spectrum tend to be comorbid with each other. For example, more severe cases of [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] tend to be associated with [[intellectual disability]] (ID). This raises the question of whether or not there are true, unique ASD genes and unique ID genes or if there are just genes just associated with neurological function that can be mutated into an abnormal phenotype. One confounding factor may be the actual diagnostic category and methods of the spectrum disorders as symptoms between severe disorders may be similar. One study investigated the comorbid symptoms between groups of ID and ASD, and found no significant difference between the symptoms of ID children, ASD children with ID and ASD children without ID. Future research may help establish a more stringent genetic basis for the diagnoses of these disorders.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the general steps for network analysis remain the same. 
* The analytical process starts out with the identification of a biological network based on experimental validation. This can be a [[gene co-expression network]], or a [[Protein–protein interaction|protein-protein interaction]] (PPI) network. The nodes of the network will be clustered.
* Subsequently, a specific list of genes with known associations to a particular phenotype of interest is generated. This list could be determined by experimental data, agnostic of genetic studies in psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is referred to as a 'hit list'. 
* Genes that belong to the hit list as well as the biological network selected in the first step are marked as such.  
* This is followed by a guilt-by-association (GBA) step. This means that clusters within the biological network that have a significant amount of genes from the hit list are investigated further using functional enrichment tools and database querying for the pathways in which these high scoring cluster genes participate &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* Thus the biological associations of the high-scoring, experimentally implicated cluster members are investigated, expanding the search area from beyond the initial hit list to include gene members of additional pathways that may have significant association with the initial biological network under consideration. This results in a set of candidate genes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The underlying principle of this approach is that the genes that cluster together, will also jointly affect the same molecular pathway. Again, they would ideally be part of a neurological function. The candidate genes can then be used to prioritize variants for wet lab validation.

== Neuropharmacology ==
Historically, due to the behavioural stimulation manifested as a symptom in several the neurogenomic disorders, the therapies would rely mostly on [[Antipsychotic|anti-psychotics]] or antidepressents. These classes of medications would suppress common symptoms of the disorders, but with questionable efficacy. The biggest barrier to neruopharmacogenomic research was the cohort sizes. Given newly available large-cohort sequencing data, there has been a recent push to expand therapeutic options. The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies. It is rare to find single high penetrance causative genes in neurological diseases. The genomic profiles understandably vary between cases, and logically, the therapies would need to vary between cases. Further complicating the issue is that many of these disorders are spectrum disorders. Their genetic etiology will vary within this spectrum. For example, severe ASD is associated with high penetrance de novo mutations. Milder forms of ASD is usually associated with a mixture of common variants.

The key issue then is the translation of these newly identified genetic variants (from [[Copy-number variation|Copy Number Variant]] studies, candidate gene sequencing and high throughput sequencing technologies) into an intervention for patients with neurogenomic disorders. One aspect will be if the neurological disorder are medically actionable (i.e. is there a simple metabolic pathway that a therapy can target). For example, specific cases of [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] have been associated with microdeletions on [[TMLHE]] gene. This gene codes for the enzyme of [[carnitine biosynthesis]]. Supplements to elevate carnitine levels appeared to alleviate certain ASD symptoms but the study was confounded by many influencing factors. As mentioned earlier, using a gene network approach will help identify relevant pathways of interest. Many neuropharmacogenomic approaches have focused on targeting the downstream products of these pathways.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine in Neuropsychiatry|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731200431X|journal = Neuron|date = 2012-06-07|pmc = 3407812|pmid = 22681682|pages = 773–776|volume = 74|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.05.004|first = Francis J.|last = McMahon|first2 = Thomas R.|last2 = Insel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From De Novo Mutations to Personalized Therapeutic Interventions in Autism|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-med-091113-024550|journal = Annual Review of Medicine|date = 2015-01-01|pmid = 25587659|pages = 487–507|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-091113-024550|first = William M.|last = Brandler|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Sebat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blood brain barrier ===
Studies in animal models for several brain diseases has shown that the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood brain barrier]] (BBB) undergoes modification at many levels; for example, the surface glycoprotein composition can influence the types of HIV-1 strains transported by the BBB. The BBB has been found to be key in the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mouse models of neurological disorders: a view from the blood-brain barrier|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2010-10-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmc = 2891624|pmid = 19879356|pages = 881–888|volume = 1802|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.011|first = William A.|last = Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely difficult, however, to be able to study this in humans due to obvious restrictions with accessing the brain and retrieving biological specimens for sequencing or morphological analysis. Mice models of the BBB and models of disease states have served well in conceptualizing the BBB as a regulatory interface between disease and good health in the brain.

=== Personalized neurobiology ===
The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Genomic samples of individual patients could be used to identify predictive factors, or to better understand the specific prognosis of a neurogenomic disease, and use this information to guide treatment options.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is a clear clinical utility to this approach, the adaptation of this approach is still nonexistent.

There are various issues prohibiting the application of personalized genomics to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. 
* Firstly, the causative network biology of several spectrum disorders with neurogenomic underpinnings is not fully understood yet, in spite of extensive studies conducted with disorders like [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum]]&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus, the analytical validity of standing hypotheses concerning the etiology of neurogenomic disorders has still not been fully established and is subject to debate and controversy.
* The clinical validity of genetic variants that have shown to be highly correlated with specific neurogenomic disorders is often a major cause of concern.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The interpretation of these test results, and subsequent decision making, are a complicated undertaking given the polygenic nature of many of these disorders. Complicating things further, it has been shown that pre-emptive intervention in major psychiatric disorders does not always reduce the risk for the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intervention might not even be available for at-risk offspring of affected adults, thereby limiting the 'medical actionability' of the data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
* Ethical concerns have also been raised regarding the safeguarding of personal genomic information, and how best to approach the burden of incidental findings and family risk assessment. 
** Consanguinity and in-breeding can lead to selective enrichment of rare, otherwise low penetrance genetic mutations attributed to various symptoms of neurogenomic disorders. Thus, the interpretation of family-specific genetic mutations and/or network-level disruptions in the onset of a rare psychiatric disorder requires careful consideration of the motivations of participants included in the study.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
** That said, these issues can be addressed by effective education and counseling, and collection of genomic data from patients with psychiatric disorders should not be disqualified solely on this basis. The data itself serves as a dynamic health resource and can significantly further our understanding of the genomic basis of several psychiatric disorders.

[[File:M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center Nathan M. Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.jpg|thumb|275px|Entrance to the Yeh Student Center]]

The '''Nathan M. Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory''', or '''Newmark Lab''', located at 205 N. Mathews Avenue in [[Urbana, Illinois]] on the campus of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], houses the university's [[Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering]].  The Lab was built in 1967, and has been modified and updated a number of times since then.&lt;ref name=fac&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/portalresearch_facilities "Civil and Environmental Engineering: Research Facilities"]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was named after professor and department head [[Nathan M. Newmark]] after his death.

The building consists of classrooms and offices surrounding a large open area called the crane bay for large scale experiments,&lt;ref name=fac /&gt; including those of the Newmark Structural Engineering Lab (NSEL). Newmark also contains a professional machine shop where students and faculty can have material fabricated by the staffed professionals, and a student instrumentation workshop where students and faculty can fabricate materials themselves.

In 2011, the M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center was added to the building.

== Crane bay ==

The crane bay is a large open area in the center of Newmark Laboratory with a three story height. It is where much of the department's structural research and testing is done. There are large doors on both the north and south sides of this area, where trucks and equipment can move through.  The crane bay gets its name from two large yellow hydraulic cranes on rails above the room, which move heavy equipment around. The crane bay houses many structural analysis equipment, including a concrete cylinder crusher for strength tests and beam deflection measurement devices. There is also a {{convert|28|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} L-shaped concrete reaction wall with hydraulic actuators, which was added in 2004. The crane bay's large open size is also sometimes used for departmental events such as Engineering Open House and the department's annual career fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Grzegorz Banas | title=NSEL Policy 2009 | url=http://nsel.cee.illinois.edu/website2008upgrade/safety.policy/nsel.policy.2009.02.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center ==

In 2011, an addition called the M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center, designed by Teng &amp; Associates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecandsinc.com/newmarkyeh.html "M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center Addition - Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory - University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Campus"]&lt;/ref&gt; was completed at the cost of $7 million, adding {{convert|20500|sqft|m2}}  of classrooms, student study space and meeting rooms. The Yeh Center was funded entirely with private gifts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/yehcenter "Civil and Environmental Engineering: M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leader&gt;[http://issuu.com/ceeatillinois/docs/history_2_pdf_issuu "Leadership and Legacy"]&lt;/ref&gt; in particular a $4 million gift from M. T. Geoffrey Yeh, a 1953 graduate of the Department of Civil Engineering. Yeh is chairman of [[Hsin Chong]] International Holdings, Ltd., a large construction company in China.

The remainder of the funding for the addition came from private sources including alumni and corporate sponsors, and $1.0 million contributions by both the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the College of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=March 2011 U of I Trustee Meeting Agenda/ | url=http://www.uillinois.edu/trustees/agenda/March%2011,%202009/014%20mar%20UIUC%20Yeh%20Student%20Center.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in time for the start of classes in fall 2011.

Since the end of the 20th century, [[propaganda]] has evolved significantly. Today's propaganda is characterised by [[psych-op]]s and [[disinformation]], whereas a few decades ago it was dominated by posters and simple films.


==Middle East==

===Afghan War===

In the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]], [[psychological operations]] tactics were employed to [[demoralization (military)|demoralise]] the [[Taliban]] and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six [[EC-130E|EC-130E Commando Solo]] aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages. [[Pamphlets|Leaflets]] were also dropped throughout Afghanistan, offering rewards for [[Osama bin Laden]] and other individuals, portraying Americans as friends of Afghanistan and emphasising various negative aspects of the Taliban. Another shows a picture of [[Mohammed Omar]] in a set of crosshairs with the words: "We are watching."

===Iraq War===

Both the [[United States]] and [[Iraq]] employed propaganda during the [[Iraq War]]. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Altheide, David L 2009"&gt;Altheide, David L. "War and Mass Mediated Evidence." Cultural Studies&amp;nbsp;— Critical Methodologies 9 (2009): 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraqi propaganda====

The Iraqi insurgency's plan was to gain as much support as possible by using violence as their propaganda tool.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Andrew 2007"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 23–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Vietcong]]'s tactics,&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"&gt;Schleifer, Ron. "Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly (2005): 15–24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgents]] were using rapid movement to keep the [[coalition]] off-balance.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Andrew 2007"/&gt; By using low-technology strategies to convey their messages, they were able to gain support.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 24&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti slogans were used on walls and houses praising the virtues of many group leaders while condemning the Iraqi government. Others used flyers, leaflets, articles and self-published newspapers and magazines to get the point across.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Insurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the [[U.S. Government|US Government]] were trying to influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 26&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgents designed advertisements that cost a fraction of what the US was spending on their ads aimed at the same people in Iraq with much more success.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In addition, a domestic [[Arabic language]] television station was established with the aim of informing the Iraqi public of alleged coalition propaganda efforts in the country.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt;

====US propaganda in Iraq====
[[File:your future al-Zarqawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States of America|US]] [[Psychological operations|PSYOP]] [[pamphlet]] disseminated in [[Iraq]]. The pamphlet says: "This is your future, Al-Zarqawi", and shows [[Al-Qaeda]] fighter [[Al-Zarqawi]] caught in a rat trap.]]
To achieve their aim of a moderate, pro-western Iraq, US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis, but differentiating between "good" and "bad" Islam has proved challenging for the US.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt;

The US implemented [[Black Propaganda|black propaganda]] by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro-American information, but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein. One radio station used was ''Radio Tikrit''.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt; Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts; this was brought forth by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="ShahAnup"&gt;Shah, Anup. Iraq War Media Reporting, Journalism and Propaganda. Aug 1, 2007. May 12, 2009. &lt;http://www.globalissues.org/article/461/media-reporting-journalism-and-propaganda.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that it was the [[Lincoln Group]] who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda. However, their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="ShahAnup" /&gt;

The US was more successful with the ''[[Voice of America]]'' campaign, which is an old [[Cold War]] tactic that exploited people's desire for information.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt; While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful,{{fact|date=February 2016}} they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, Sol 2008"&gt;Goldstein, Sol. "A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq." Military Review 88.2 (Mar. 2008): 58–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' alleged that the [[United States military]] had [[media manipulation|manipulated news]] reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the [[insurgency]]. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is "an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents", while a spokesman for former [[Defense Secretary]] [[Donald H. Rumsfeld]] said the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] confirmed the existence of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Baldor | first = Lolita C. | title = U.S. Military Unclear on 'Planted' Stories | agency = Associated Press | date = November 30, 2005 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/11/30/national/w140545S58.DTL | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060630204816/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2005%2F11%2F30%2Fnational%2Fw140545S58.DTL | archivedate = June 30, 2006 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Baldor | first = Lolita C. | title = Pentagon describes Iraq propaganda plan | agency = Associated Press | date = December 2, 2005 | url = http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13305355.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051205031408/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13305355.htm |archivedate = December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda aimed at US citizens====
The extent to which the US government used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book ''Selling Intervention &amp; War,'' by Jon Western, argued that president Bush was "selling the war" to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Thrall, A. Trevor. "A Review of: "Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq, by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber Weapons of Mass Persuasion: Marketing the War Against Iraq, by Paul Rutherford Selling Intervention &amp; War: The Presidency, the..." Political Communication 24.2 (Apr. 2007): 202–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

President George W. Bush gave a talk at the Athena Performing Arts Centre, at Greece Athena Middle and High School, Tuesday, May 24, 2005, in Rochester, New York. About halfway through the event, Bush said: "See, in my line of work, you got to keep repeating things over and over, and over again, for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda."

People had their initial reactions to the War on Terror.  While the United States' official stance was to remove Saddam Hussein's power in Iraq with allegations that his government held weapons of mass destruction or was related to [[Osama Bin Laden]],&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas 2004"&gt;O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas. "Weapons of Mass Seduction: Propaganda, Media and the Iraq War." Journal of Political Marketing 3.4 (2004): 79–104. America: History &amp; Life.&lt;/ref&gt; over time the Iraq war as a whole has been seen in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;John, Sue Lockett, et al. "Going Public, Crisis after Crisis: The Bush Administration and the Press from September 11 to Saddam." Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 10.2 (Summer2007 2007): 195–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Video and picture coverage in the news has shown images of [[torture]] and other PR disasters being done under the [[Iraqi Government]].&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas 2004"/&gt;

==North Korea==
{{Main|Propaganda in North Korea}}
[[File:NKmuseum.jpg|thumb|North Koreans touring the [[Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities|Museum of American War Atrocities]].]]
Every year, a state-owned publishing house{{which|date=July 2014}} releases several cartoons (called ''[[geurim-chaek]]'' in [[North Korea]]), many of which are smuggled across the [[China–North Korea border|Chinese border]] and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the ''[[Juche]]'' philosophy of [[Kim Il-sung]] (the "father" of North Korea)—radical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for naïve North Korean characters.

DPRK textbooks claim that US missionaries came to the Korean Peninsula and committed barbarous acts against Korean children, including injecting dangerous liquids into the children and writing the word "THIEF" on the forehead of any child who stole an apple for missionary-owned orchards in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentaryaddict.com/Nuclear+Nightmare+Understanding+North+Korea-10151-doc.html Nuclear Nightmare: Understanding North Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexican drug cartels==

Drug cartels have been engaged in propaganda and psychological campaigns to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners and [[narcomanta|''narcomantas'']] to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. They have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word ''narco'', and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food and architecture that all have been branded ''narco''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels-newspapers|title=Analysis: A PR department for Mexico's narcos|last=O'Connor|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2010|work=[[GlobalPost]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/the-narco-generation/|title=The Narco Generation|last=Beckhart|first=Sarah|date=February 21, 2011|work=AL DÍA|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]'s Mexico Institute|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==

The [[Shared values initiative]] was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a "new" America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely, without persecution, in post-9/11 America.&lt;ref name="Rampton"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Shared Values Revisited|journal=Center for Media and Democracy|date=October 17, 2007|first=Sheldon|last=Rampton|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.prwatch.org/node/6465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by the [[United States Department of State]], the campaign created a public relations front group known as Council of American Muslims for Understanding (CAMU). The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini-documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. Reaches Out to Muslim World with Shared Values Initiative|journal=America.gov|date=January 16, 2003|first=|last=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id=|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2003/January/20030116185938skaufman@pd.state.gov0.3441126.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018222857/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2003/January/20030116185938skaufman%40pd.state.gov0.3441126.html|archivedate=October 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of propaganda can be traced back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government.&lt;ref name=mitter /&gt; China in the era of [[Mao Zedong]] is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimise the state and the policies of leaders. It was the first Chinese government to successfully make use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and [[Literacy|illiterate]] population.&lt;ref name=mitter /&gt; In poor developing countries, China spreads propaganda through methods such as opening [[Confucius Institute]]s, and providing training programs in China for foreign officials and students.&lt;ref name="KL"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|author2=Perry Link |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124319304482150525| year=2009|title=China's Modern Authoritarianism|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firmas de Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Signatures by Rembrandt published by the Rembrandt Research Project.]]
The '''Rembrandt Research Project''' (RRP) is an initiative of the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (NWO), which is the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. Its purpose is to organize and categorize research on [[Rembrandt]], with the aim of discovering new facts about this [[Dutch Golden Age]] painter and his studio. The project was started in 1968, but has since become the authority on Rembrandt and has final say in whether a painting is ''genuine''.

==Results==
As a result of the project, which analyzed documentation, techniques, and forensic research on Rembrandt paintings from his early years in [[Leiden]] until his death, the number of signed Rembrandt ''self-portraits'' around the world has been reduced by half. Also, more paintings have been attributed to [[List of Rembrandt pupils|students working in the Rembrandt studio]], and more has been discovered about the ways in which the students worked. Recently, period copies of Rembrandt paintings are being studied for clues as to whether certain copies were factory-style pieces for visiting functionaries. Rembrandt's work was in high demand for decades, and he managed to keep productivity up while also keeping his prices high by enforcing strict quality control on the work done in his studio.

The project's six-volume publication, ''A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings'', is considered the definitive authority by all auction houses and dealers who work with works by Rembrandt and his studio. The research project has proved invaluable to art historians, and the lack of such a project for other prominent Dutch painters such as [[Frans Hals]] is felt sorely by museums and collectors trying to acquire the same sort of ''stamp of approval'' on their paintings.  However, the project has also initiated debate about the feasibility of conclusive attribution, particularly for painters who were associated with one or more workshops.

==Concordance with other Rembrandt catalogs==
The research project is also the single point of reference regarding concordance with other catalogs of the master's works, though most of these reference each other, as well. Below is a partial list of some commonly quoted catalogs:
* ''Catalogue extracted from the Register L R. fol. 29 to 39 inclusive, of the Inventory of the Effects of Rembrandt Van Rhyn'', deposited in the Office of the Administration of Insolvent Estates at Amsterdam, 1656 (published in English by Smith, 1836)

===Old man with turban===
In 1998, the pAn Amsterdam art fair showed a Rembrandt for the first time that until then had been attributed to his pupil [[Jacques des Rousseaux]]. This painting was first cataloged in 1917 by [[Abraham Bredius]], who accepted it as a Rembrandt. Later [[Kurt Bauch]] rejected this based on a photograph and attributed it to [[Jan Lievens]] without ever having seen the painting. [[Werner Sumowski]] re-attributed the painting based on photographs to Rousseaux as a rebuttal to the arguments by art historians Bauch, [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Horst Gerson]].&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;Catalog [http://www.pan.nl/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=58&amp;lg=nl pAn Amsterdam] 1998, p.11-17&lt;/ref&gt; The Rembrandt Research project seeks to avoid such arguments by making attributions based on historical and forensic evidence. The study of Rembrandt's oevre includes study of drawings and etchings as well as paintings by a wide range of artists who were Rembrandt's contemporaries. Analysis of his techniques includes the study of paints and panel wood he and his contemporaries used, while x-rays of paintings reveal whether a painting is a copy based on the amount of "discovery" drawing in the underlayer.

The pAn 1998 catalog contains an article by [[Ernst van de Wetering]] with foto's of other depictions of the same man by [[Jan Lievens]], [[Gerard Dou]], and Jacques Rousseau (thus the mis-attribution). The man has clearly the same face in all four portraits.

====Rembrandt's father====
According to Van de Wetering, this is the man often referred to as ''Rembrandt's father'', who was probably not his father, but a functionary in the [[Leiden Guild of St. Luke|Leiden painters' guild]] or male model.&lt;ref name=catalog /&gt;

==End==
In early 2011, the RRP board voted to terminate the project by the end of 2011 even though approximately one-quarter of Rembrandt's oeuvre has not yet been investigated.  A major reason for this decision was the lack of scholars available to assume responsibilities from the RRP's chair, [[Ernst van de Wetering]], who has been involved with the project since 1968.  Other reasons cited included lack of funding, as the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] ceased funding the project in 1998.  However, with funding from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] and the [[Mauritshuis]] have launched a pilot initiative called the [http://www.rembrandtdatabase.org/ Rembrandt Database] that will build off of and supplement research from the RRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rembrandt-Research-Project-ended/23044# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926052740/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rembrandt-Research-Project-ended/23044# |archive-date=2011-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL. Forced sex and intimate partner violence: effects on women’s risk and women’s health. Violence Against Women, 1999, 5:1017–1035.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granados Shiroma M.Salud reproductiva y violencia contra la mujer: un ana lisis desde la perspectiva de género. [Reproductive health and violence against women: an analysis from the gender perspective of Nuevo Leon, Asociación Mexicana de Población, Colegio de México, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual violence may occur without physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hakimi M et al. Silence for the sake of harmony: domestic violence and women’s health in central Java. Yogyakarta, Gadjah Mada University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in a representative sample of over 6000 men, 7% reported having sexually and physically abused their wives, 22% reported using sexual violence without physical violence and 17% reported that they had used physical violence alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin SL et al. Sexual behaviour and reproductive health outcomes: associations with wife abuse in India. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1999, 282:1967–1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">The '''Space Situational Awareness''' ('''SSA''') '''Programme''' is the [[European Space Agency]]'s initiative designed to support [[Space policy of the European Union|Europe's independent space access and utilization]] through the timely and accurate information delivery regarding the space environment, and particularly hazards to both in orbit and ground infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ssa-about&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/About_SSA|title=About SSA|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSA programme is split into three main segments:&lt;ref name=ssa-overview&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/SSA_Programme_overview|title=SSA Programme overview|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Space Weather]] (SWE) segment: monitoring the [[Sun]], the [[solar wind]], and in Earth’s [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]], that can affect spaceborne and ground-based infrastructure or endanger human life or health
* [[Near-Earth Objects]] (NEO) segment: detecting natural objects, such as [[asteroids]] and [[comets]], which can potentially [[Impact event|impact Earth]]
* [[Space surveillance|Space Surveillance and Tracking]] (SST) segment: Tracking active and inactive [[satellite]]s and [[space debris]] (collectively these items are referred to as [[Resident Space Object | Resident Space Objects]] (RSOs)).

The SSA programme is being implemented as an optional ESA programme with financial participation by 14 Member States. The programme started in 2009 and its mandate was extended until 2019. The second phase of the programme received €46.5 million for the 2013-2016 period.&lt;ref name=ssa-overview /&gt;

==Space Weather Segment==
The main objective of the Space Weather Segment (SWE) is to detect and forecast of [[space weather]] events, avoid adverse effect on European space assets and ground-based infrastructure. To achieve that, the segment will focus on delivery of real-time space weather information, forecasts and warnings, supported by a data archive, applications and services. Assets currently available for the segment consist of multiple ground-based and spaceborne sensors monitoring the Sun, [[solar wind]] and Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. These include the [[PROBA2]] satellite and the [[Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory]]. The segment is jointly coordinated by the SWE Data Centre located at the [[ESTRACK]] [[Redu Station]] and the SSA Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC), both in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=swe&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Weather_-_SWE_Segment|title=SWE Segment|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth Object Segment==
The [[near-Earth object]] segment aims to deliver monitoring and warning of potential [[Impact event|Earth impactors]] and tracking of newly discovered objects. The segment's current assets consist of a mixture of professional and amateur telescopes, including the [[OGS Telescope]], that are supported by tracking databases. The plans are to create a fully integrated system supporting alerts for civil authorities. The segment is operated by the SSA NEO Coordination Centre located at the [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=neo&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Near-Earth_Objects_-_NEO_Segment |title=NEO Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment==
The SST segment's primary goal is the detection, cataloguing and orbit prediction of objects orbiting the Earth. It is part of an effort to avoid collisions between orbiting satellites and debris, provide safe reentries, detect on-orbit explosions, assist missions at launch, deployment and end-of-life and overall reduce cost of space access. The segment currently relies on existing European radar and optical systems. Some of its assets are existing [[radio telescope|radio]] and [[optical telescopes]], with now serving a secondary role for tracking space debris.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Surveillance_and_Tracking_-_SST_Segment| title=SST Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radar-based SST assets are split into two categories: surveillance and tracking systems. SSA SST radar systems include:&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml| title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sumac Kawsay'''  ''Buen Vivir''  ("good living") rooted in the cosmovisión (or worldview) of the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples of the Andes, sumak kawsay – or buen vivir, to give it its Spanish name – describes a way of doing things that is community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is related to tradition of legal and political scholarship advocating legal standing for the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"&gt;Stone CD, Should Trees Have Standing? Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects. Southern California Law Review 1972;45:450; W Kaufmann, Los Altos, 1974 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property.&lt;ref name="Celdf"&gt;Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000 animals, plants and other organisms have their rights to dignity recognised by the Constitution in Switzerland (art. 120), but the implications of this disposition are still not very clear. With the enactment of [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|its 2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the Rights of Nature and to inform a more clarified content to those rights. Articles 10 and 71–74 of the Ecuadorian Constitution recognize the inalienable rights of [[ecosystems]] to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights.

==History==
{{Further|Plant rights|Environmental movement}}

=== Rights of nature in legal history ===
In his famous work, "Should Trees Have Standing?", Christopher Stone presented the case for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment. As Stone explained, as a rights-holder the natural object would “have a legally recognised worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‘us’”. To achieve rights-holder status, the natural object must satisfy three criteria: [First], that the thing can institute legal actions at its behest; second, that in determining the granting of legal relief, the court must take injury to it into account; and third, that relief must run to the benefit of it.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"/&gt;

In his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case, ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'', 405 U.S. 727 (1972), Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that "inanimate objects" should have standing to sue in court: {{quote|The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton.&lt;ref name=405US727&gt;{{Cite court|title=a|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/405/727/case.html#741|year=1972|accessdate=October 8, 2011|court=USSC|litigants=Sierra Club v. Morton|opinion=727|pinpoint=741–43|reporter=U.S.|vol=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Douglas continued: {{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a [[Legal fiction|fiction]] found useful for maritime purposes. The [[corporation sole]]{{mdash}}a creature of ecclesiastical law{{mdash}}is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases.... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes{{mdash}}fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.&lt;ref name=405US727 /&gt;}}

In 2012 [[New Zealand]]'s [[Whanganui River]] was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.&lt;ref name=nzh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shuttleworth|first1=Kate|title=Agreement entitles Whanganui River to legal identity|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830586|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fairbrother|first1=Alison|title=New Zealand's Whanganui River Gains A Legal Voice|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/18/new-zealand-whanganui-river_n_1894893.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vines, T., Bruce, A., Faunce, T.

===Outcome from neoliberal development in Ecuador===

The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "''Buen Vivir''" or good living, which focuses on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth, gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of ''Buen Vivir'' originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of ''Buen Vivir''.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. Latin American Perspectives 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoliberal development schemes in line with the "[[Washington Consensus]]" did not create prosperity for much of Ecuador's population, especially its [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|indigenous population]]s, who make up about 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Acosta"&gt;Acosta, Alberto, Eduardo Gudynas, Esperanza Martínez, and Joseph H.

Policy Innovations. http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000077&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, based on the exportation of the country's raw materials, mainly oil, was also wreaking havoc on the nation's environment, an area with valuable biological and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Arsel"&gt;Arsel, Murat 2012. Between 'Marx and Markets'? The State, The 'Left Turn' And Nature In Ecuador. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography) 103(2):150-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The global economic crisis of 2008 revealed the vulnerabilities of an extractive economy, and led to a period of political turmoil in the country that made obviously the need for a new more inclusive government that embodied a post-oil, post-neoliberal development paradigm.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; In late 2006, the election of leftist Rafael Correa, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform, showed the emergence of a new political era for Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

===''Buen Vivir''===

''Buen Vivir'' ("good living") emerged as a response to the traditional strategies for development and their negative environmental, social, or economic effects. ''Buen Vivir'' is an alternative concept of development that focuses on the attainment of the "good life" in a broad sense, only attainable within a community; a community that includes Nature. A popular approach to ''Buen Vivir'' is the Ecuadorian concept of ''[[w:es:sumak kawsay|sumak kawsay]]'', meaning a full life in [[kichwa]]. Part of this concept also emphasizes living in harmony with other people and nature. ''Buen Vivir'' has gained new popularity, spreading throughout parts of [[South America]] and evolving as a multicultural concept. Social consensus led to the inclusion of ''Buen Vivir'' in Ecuador's new constitution, supported as an alternative to neoliberal development. The constitution outlines ''Buen Vivir'' as a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; In line with the assertion of these rights, ''Buen Vivir'' changes the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SENPLADES"&gt;SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document, http://plan2009.senplades.gob.ec/web/en/presentation, accessed May, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous movement===

The inclusion of "Buen Vivir" and Rights of Nature in the constitution was ushered in largely due to the increased influence of indigenous activist groups in the political realm. After several years of worsening economic and environmental conditions, uprisings from various indigenous communities, who found themselves receiving less support from the state, while simultaneously their land was being increasingly encroached upon by oil companies, brought attention to their concerns.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; After historically being excluded from the political process, indigenous groups, especially concerned about the worsening environmental devastation of the extraction business and global [[climate change]], started social movements aimed at creating a new approach to development that would protect the environment and harmonize its relationship with people. [[CONAIE]] (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), the largest federation of indigenous movements, encompassing 14 of the nation's indigenous groups, and other groups focused on social justice began lobbying for a new constitution that incorporated recognition of the nation's indigenous groups, their language, culture, history, and land rights, and inherently their concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''[[Pachamama]]'' (English: "Mother Nature").&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

===Drafting===
President [[Rafael Correa]] included calling for a constitutional assembly in his 2006 campaign. On April 15, 2007, over 80% of Ecuadorians voted in favor of calling a new assembly, thanks in large part to the support of indigenous communities. Indigenous groups had been pressuring for a new, more inclusive constitution for years, and were therefore actively involved in the drafting process. Alberto Acosta, the elected Assembly President, pledged to make the assembly more inclusive and incorporate the concerns of the indigenous into the constitution. In the end, a few indigenous representatives were elected to the assembly.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; To create a constitution based on the principles of ''Buen Vivir'', the Constitutional Assembly, with the advice of the [[Pachamama]] Alliance, enlisted the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) to draft language for the new provisions of the constitution detailing the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt; Indigenous groups also played a role in the drafting process. Fundación Pachamama, in conjunction with leaders in CONAIE, met with members of the assembly to present their ideas for the constitution and gain support. A national media campaign detailing the tenets of the new constitution and the Rights of Nature was also launched to inform and gain support from the public.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;Fundación Pachamama (FP). 2011 [http://www.derechosdelanaturaleza.org/website/files/2011/01/Recogniting-Rights-for-Nature-in-the-Ecuadorian-Constitution-Fundacion-Pachamama1.pdf "Recognizing Rights for Nature in the Ecuadorian Constitution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
On April 10, 2008, with 91 votes out of 130, the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly|Constitutional Assembly]] approved Article 10 for inclusion in the new constitution. On June 7, the language of Articles 71 through 74, compiling the Rights of Nature, were presented and debated on, before receiving approval for inclusion in the constitution.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
On September 28, 2008, a mandatory [[referendum]] was held to vote on the new constitution, where the adoption of the constitution was approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Gar. 2009, "In Ecuador, Trees Now Have Rights", ''Earth Island Journal'' 23(4):15-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Rights of Nature==

===Title II===

===Rights===

===Chapter one===

===Principles for the enforcement of rights===

'''Article 10.''' Persons, communities, peoples, nations and communities are bearers of rights and shall enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution and in international instruments.
Nature shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it.

===Chapter seven===

===Rights of nature===

'''Article 71.''' Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.
All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate.
The State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.

'''Article 72.''' Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems.
In those cases of severe or permanent environmental impact, including those caused by the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences.

'''Article 73.''' The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles.
The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation’s genetic assets is forbidden.

'''Article 74.''' Persons, communities, peoples, and nations shall have the right to benefit from the environment and the natural wealth enabling them to enjoy the good way of living.
Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.&lt;ref name="PDBA"&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html "2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador. Political Database of the Americas (PDBA)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Rights of Nature is significant as it is the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or ''Pachamama'', as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt;
 
The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''Pachamama'', as well as recognized the [[plurinationality]] of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko"&gt;Mychalejko, Cyril. 2008 Ecuador's Constitution Gives Rights to Nature. Philadelphia Independent Media Center.&lt;/ref&gt; By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and [[mitigation of climate change]], and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies.&lt;ref name="SENPLADES" /&gt;

===Legal effects===
The Rights of Nature has been applied to several legal disputes and considered in government development initiatives.

====Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja====
''Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja'' was the first case in history to vindicate the Rights of Nature. The lawsuit was filed against the local government near Rio Vilcabamba in March 2011, who were responsible for a road expansion project that dumped debris into the river, narrowing its width and thereby doubling its speed. The project was also done without the completion of an [[environmental impact assessment]] or consent of the local residents. The case was filed by two such residents, citing the violation of the Rights of Nature, rather than property rights, for the damage done to the river. The case was important because the court stated that the rights of nature would prevail over other constitutional rights if they were in conflict with each other, setting an important precedent. The proceedings also confirmed that the burden of proof to show there is no damage lies with the defendant. Though the plaintiffs were granted a victory in court, the enforcement of the ruling has been lacking, as the local government has been slow to comply with the mandated reparations.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, Erin. 2012, [http://celdf.live2.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/The_Ecuadorian_Exemplar_The_First_Ever_Vindications_of_Constitutional_Rights_of_Nature.pdf "Ecuadorian Exemplar: The First Ever Vindications of Constitutional Rights"], ''Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law'' 21(1): 63-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====República del Ecuador Asamblea Nacional, Comisión de la Biodiversidad y Recursos Naturales====
In March 2011, right after the ruling on the ''Wheeler'' case, the government of Ecuador filed a case against illegal gold mining operations in northern Ecuador, in the remote districts San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro. The rights of nature were violated by the mining operations, which were argued to be polluting the nearby rivers. This case is different from the previous in that it was the government addressing the violation of the rights of nature. It was also swiftly enforced, as military operation to destroy the machinery used for illegal mining was ordered and implemented.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

====Yasuni ITT initiative====
The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, referring to the corridor of oil reserves within the [[Yasuni National Park]], is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation from the international community for at least half of the projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights.&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasuní Guarantee Certificates, denoting the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the [[European Union]] [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

==Reactions==

===Praise===
The adoption of the Rights of Nature by Ecuador has received praise internationally by many countries who see this as a revolutionary way to conceptualize the environment and a way for Ecuador to move beyond the extractive economy of its past.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; Initiatives to adopt the concept of ecosystem rights have been taken or are being taken in various parts of the world, including Bolivia, Turkey, Nepal, and various municipalities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
Criticisms of the Rights of Nature have generally centered on the mechanisms of enforcement of the provision. One criticism is that though the constitution establishes stronger regulations for the environment, it also gives the state the power to relax these regulations if found to be in the national interest.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; Therefore, much of the enforcement of the ecosystem rights depends on the will of the government, or an active citizenry.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Indigenous groups have also expressed dissatisfaction that the constitution does not give local communities veto power over projects affecting their land.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt; Others also feel a major weakness of the constitution is that it does not require prior or informed consent by communities before the start of development projects, which can undermine their ability to uphold the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt; There are also concerns that the Rights of Nature could negatively affect [[foreign direct investment]] since companies will not want to comply with the more stringent regulations.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; On the other hand, people are skeptical of the Correa administration for still approving projects by foreign extraction companies violating the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt;

A '''transcriptor''' is a [[transistor]]-like device composed of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] rather than a [[semiconducting material]] such as [[silicon]].  Prior to its invention in 2013, the transcriptor was considered an important component to build [[biocomputer|biological computers]].&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;

==Background==
To function, a modern [[computer]] needs three different capabilities:  It must be able to [[data storage device|store information]], transmit information between components, and possess a basic [[logic family|system of logic]].&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;  Prior to March 2013, scientists had successfully demonstrated the ability to store and transmit data using biological components made of proteins and [[DNA]].&lt;ref name=IO9&gt;{{cite news|title=This new discovery will finally allow us to build biological computers|author=Robert T. Gonzalez|work=IO9|date=March 29, 2013|url=http://io9.com/this-new-discovery-will-finally-allow-us-to-build-biolo-462867996|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple two-terminal [[logic gate]]s had been demonstrated, but required multiple layers of inputs and thus were impractical due to scaling difficulties.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amplifying Genetic Logic Gates|author=Jerome Bonnet|author2=Peter Yin|author3=Monica E. Ortiz|author4=Pakpoom Subsoontorn|author5=Drew Endy|work=Science|date=March 28, 2013|doi= 10.1126/science.1232758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention and description==
On March 28, 2013, a team of [[bioengineer]]s from [[Stanford University]] led by [[Drew Endy]] announced that they had created the biological equivalent of a transistor, which they named a "transcriptor".  That is, they created a three-terminal device with a logic system that can control other components.&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper /&gt;  The transcriptor regulates the flow of [[RNA polymerase]] across a strand of DNA using special combinations of enzymes to control movement.&lt;ref name=Extreme&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanford creates biological transistors, the final step towards computers inside living cells|author=Sebastein Anthony|date=March 29, 2013|work=Extreme Tech|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/152074-stanford-creates-biological-transistors-the-final-step-towards-computers-inside-living-cells|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to project member Jerome Bonnet, "The choice of enzymes is important. We have been careful to select enzymes that function in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, so that bio-computers can be engineered within a variety of organisms."&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt; 

Transcriptors can replicate traditional [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], [[NOR gate|NOR]], [[NAND gate|NAND]], [[XOR gate|XOR]], and [[XNOR gate]]s with equivalents, which Endy dubbed "Boolean Integrase Logic (BIL) gates", in a single-layer process (i.e., without requiring multiple instances of the simpler gates to build up more complex ones).&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper /&gt; Like a traditional transistor, a transcriptor can amplify an input signal.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;  A group of transcriptors can do almost any type of computing, including counting and comparison.&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN /&gt;

==Impact==
Stanford dedicated the BIL gate's design to the [[public domain]], which may speed its adoption.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;  According to Endy, other researchers were already using the gates to reprogram [[metabolism]] when the Stanford team published its research.&lt;ref name=SJMN /&gt;

Computing by transcriptor is still very slow; it can take a few hours between receiving an input signal and generating an output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Make a Computer From a Living Cell|author=Katherine Bourzac|work=MIT Technology Review|publisher=Mashable|date=March 28, 2013|url=http://mashable.com/2013/03/28/computer-from-living-cell/|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endy doubted that biocomputers would ever be as fast as traditional computers, but added that is not the goal of his research.  "We're building computers that will operate in a place where your cellphone isn't going to work", he said.&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;  Medical devices with built-in biological computers could monitor, or even alter, cell behavior from inside a patient's body.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;  ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' writes:
{{quote|Moving forward, though, the potential for real biological computers is immense. We are essentially talking about {{Sic|hide=y|fully|-}}functional computers that can sense their surroundings, and then manipulate their host cells into doing just about anything. Biological computers might be used as an early-warning system for disease, or simply as a diagnostic tool&amp;nbsp;... Biological computers could tell their host cells to stop producing insulin, to pump out more adrenaline, to reproduce some healthy cells to combat disease, or to stop reproducing if cancer is detected. Biological computers will probably obviate the use of many pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;}}

[[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] biochemical engineer [[Jay Keasling]] said the transcriptor "clearly demonstrates the power of synthetic biology and could revolutionize how we compute in the future".&lt;ref name=SJMN&gt;{{cite news|title=Biological computer created at Stanford|work=San Jose  Mercury News|date=March 29, 2013|author=Lisa M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1906">A '''trigger law''' is a nickname for a [[law]] that is unenforceable, but may achieve enforceability if a key change in circumstances occurs.

==Examples==
In the [[United States]], four [[U.S. state]]s&amp;mdash;[[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]&amp;mdash;have trigger laws that would automatically [[Abortion ban|ban abortion]] if the landmark case ''[[Roe v.

==History==
Library science classes were initially offered at UNC-Chapel Hill starting in 1904; however, the university would not offer library science as a major until 1931, when the School of Library Science opened its doors to welcome 37 students and five faculty members in [[Louis Round Wilson Library|Wilson Library]], now named after [[Louis Round Wilson]], the university's first librarian, the SILS' first dean, and advocate for library science at the university.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Information and Library Science (2007). Illuminating the Past:  A history of the first 75 years of the University of North Carolina's School of Information and Library Science. Minneapolis, MN: PhotoBook Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The school opened in part because of a $100,000 grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Corporation]] given to the University to establish a school of library science.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; In 1932, the school was provisionally accredited by the ALA Board of Education for Librarianship,&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; the same year that the first class of students would graduate from the school.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; Two years later, the school became fully accredited for undergraduate library training by the ALA Board of Education for Librarianship.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; [[Image:2008-07-11 UNC-CH Wilson Library 1.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Wilson Library, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC]]The Carnegie Corporation gave SILS another $100,000 grant in 1940.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; Starting in 1950, the school offered master's courses in library science&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; leading the way for the university to approve the school's program, leading to the creation of the school's MSLS program.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt;

Two decades after the launch of its MSLS program, SILS moved out of its original home, Wilson Library, and into its current home, Manning Hall, the former home of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law|UNC School of Law]].&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; 

In 1974, the school began offering library services to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] Library at [[Research Triangle Park]].&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; 

The school officially changed its name from the School of Library Science to the School of Information and Library Science in 1988 after a faculty vote in 1987, recognizing the growing role information management would have on society.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt;

Now, SILS offers an undergraduate major and minor, two master's of science degrees, professional science master's degrees, dual master's degrees with both their own undergraduate degree and other programs at the University, several graduate certificates, and a doctor of philosophy in information and library science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sils.unc.edu/programs|title=Programs {{!}} sils.unc.edu|website=sils.unc.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of SILS' newest degrees, a professional science master's (PSM) in digital curation, is the first master's degree in the nation focused on digital curation and is offered entirely online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcuration.web.unc.edu/|title=Digital Curation Master's Degree|website=digitalcuration.web.unc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2017, SILS had 160 undergraduate students either pursuing a major in information science or a minor in information systems, with an additional 254 graduate students enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sils.unc.edu/about|title=Quick Facts About UNC SILS {{!}} sils.unc.edu|website=sils.unc.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

===Digital Project Repository===
The SILS Digital Project Repository was created by information and library science graduate students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (originally developed by SILS students Matthew Bachtell and Ying Zhang for Dr. Gary Marchionini’s Digital Libraries course). The DPR serves as an archive and showcase of student work.  The “Pathfinder Digital Library”, as it was then called, housed two archived pathfinders and provided organized lists of externally linked [[Pathfinding|pathfinders]]. The project was later taken over by SILS students Becca Cahill, Adam Webb, and Kristen Wilson, who renamed it the SILS Digital Project Repository (DPR) and expanded its scope to include portals, digital archives, and other HTML format projects. These students archived about sixty pathfinders and other projects during their administration of the site in hopes of preserving projects housed on impermanent student webspace. In spring 2006, the DPR was adopted by Lori Eakin, Emily Riley, and Ellen Whisler, who worked to collect detailed metadata for projects housed on-site and off-site in preparation for future development of the DPR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ils.unc.edu/dpr/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===ibiblio.org===
[[ibiblio]], a collaboration between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the [[Center for the Public Domain]], has been a vehicle for knowledge sharing since 1992, first as an original Sun Microsystems SunSITE, then as Metalab, finally resting on the ibiblio name in 2000. ibiblio is a free and vibrant exchange of ideas among a large community of contributors who share their knowledge across disciplines. It is one of the major distribution hubs for [[Linux]] software and has been a significant supporter of Linux development efforts since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/news/2004/ibiblioanniversary&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it started the first internet radio stream by rebroadcasting WXYC, the UNC student-run radio station. It also takes credit for the first non-commercial IPv6 / Internet2 radio stream. The site, which enters its 19th year of existence in October, is run by the School of Information and Library Science and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Journalism and Mass Communication|School of Media and Journalism]], by director and UNC professor [[Paul Jones (computer technologist)|Paul Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2010/09/online_library_ibiblioorg_receives_50000_donation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nsf1.jpg|thumb|left|National Science Foundation Logo]]

===LifeTime Library===
LifeTime Library is an online comprehensive file hosting site that is available to the school’s incoming students.&lt;ref name="dailytarheel.com"&gt;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2011/09/lifetime_library_to_improve_le_storing_sharing&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed to store documents and photos for students so they can have access to them forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2011/09/new_computerized_lifetime_library_will_be_used_by_unc&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Marchionini, dean of the school, said LifeTime Library is the first program of its kind to be used by a university in the nation.
With the program, students can permanently store and later retrieve computer files that are usually kept on hard drives and social media sites. The program’s data is stored on a series of disks managed by the school and other departments.&lt;ref name="dailytarheel.com"/&gt; Two years in the making, the LifeTime Library has benefited from research projects funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and other prestigious sources. Users can fine-tune their libraries, setting up policies and new capabilities, and therefore Marchionini expects the libraries to provide new learning experiences for the school’s students. Eventually, researchers would like to see it synchronize with multiple devices. So far, SILS has provided storage for the LifeTime Library, but Marchionini’s vision is for the project to be offered to all Carolina students. Business partners may be recruited to help with costs so that the LifeTime Library could continue to be free to students and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncnews.unc.edu/content/view/4759/107/&lt;/ref&gt;

===DigCCurr===
This three-year, collaborative project seeks to develop an openly accessible, graduate-level curricular framework, course modules, and experiential and enrichment components and exemplars necessary to prepare students to work in the 21st-century environment of trusted digital and data [[Digital library|repositories]]. To accomplish these tasks, this project brings together key international figures in [[digital preservation]] from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], and [[New Zealand]], to serve on an Advisory Board. Repositories at UNC-CH will provide IMLS-funded Carolina Digital Curation Fellows hands-on application of the principles taught as they manage a wide range of digital objects, including public records, cultural heritage assets, teaching materials, and research data. These Fellowships will serve to integrate the curriculum and the experiential components, advertise the existence of the programs at SILS, and draw attention to the need for digital curation. Sustainability and updating of the educational products will be ensured through programmatic adoption at UNC-CH and widespread dissemination and use at other educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ils.unc.edu/digccurr/aboutI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===DataNet===
In October 2011, the [[National Science Foundation]] awarded nearly $8 million over five years to the DataNet Federation Consortium, a group that spans seven universities, to build and deploy a prototype national data management infrastructure. 
About half of the award supports research and development at the school. This consortium (led by The Data Intensive Cyber Environments research group at SILS) addresses the research collaboration needs of six science and engineering disciplines: oceanography, hydrology, engineering design, plant biology, cognitive science and social science. The infrastructure project supports collaborative multi-disciplinary research through shared collections, data publication within digital libraries and development of reference collections in archives.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty research: digital innovation lab. (2012, Spring). Information &amp; Library Science @Carolina, 77, 36. Retrieved from http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/p249901coll22&amp;CISOPTR=27342&amp;REC=10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with RENCI===
[[RENCI]] at UNC-Chapel Hill opened in summer 2007 in the new Manning Information Technology Services building located on South Campus. The site supports the use of visualization technology and advanced computational methods to explore issues in science, engineering, the arts, humanities and social sciences. This state-of-the-art facility gives RENCI the opportunity to collaborate with UNC faculty on new and existing multidisciplinary research projects. The institution works with scientists who study critical issues and form research teams that involve faculty members at universities across North Carolina and the U.S. and that are positioned to bring major research projects to North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renci.org/about/mission&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, SILS professor &amp; RENCI chief scientist Arcot Rajasekar is the principal investigator of one of eight new Big Data research projects receiving awards from the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) with support from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). Rajasekar’s project, “DataBridge – A Sociometric System for Long-Tail Science Data Collections,” will use socio-metric networks similar to [[LinkedIn]] or [[Facebook]] to enable scientists to find data and like-minded research. It is expected to improve the discovery of relevant scientific data across large, distributed and diverse collections. The funds provided by NSF for the DataBridge project total $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renci.org/news/releases/nsf-big-data-grant-winners-include-renci-and-unc-researcher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Undergraduate Program===
SILS first offered a minor in information systems in 1997 and started a major in information science in 2003.  UNC-Chapel Hill is the only university in the state of North Carolina offering a bachelor's degree in information science and is one of only a handful of schools nationwide offering such a program. The '''Bachelor of Science in Information Science''' is designed to prepare its graduates for a variety of careers in the information industry, including information architecture, database design and implementation, Web design and implementation, and information consulting, as well as for graduate study.  The major requires 30 credits hours worth of courses, as well as 4 approved electives and the completion of certain prerequisites before applying to the major.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/undergraduate/bsis/curriculum&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Minor in Information Systems''' provides students with an understanding of computing, multi¬media, electronic information resources, and the Internet that complements the student's major field of study.  Students concentrate their studies in the junior and senior years.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/undergraduate/bsis&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dual Bachelor-Master's Program====
Introduced in 2011, the Dual Bachelor's - Master's program is intended to enable Information Science (IS) majors to obtain both their BS and MS degree by early planning of an undergraduate program that integrates well with the graduate degree requirements for either a MSIS or a MSLS within five years. Of the 24 iSchools in North America, only four offer an accelerated Bachelor's - Master's program of any sort; and other than these four iSchools, only one of the 58 programs accredited by the American Library Association offer an accelerated Bachelor's - Master's program.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/bs-ms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate Program===
*The '''Master of Science in Library Science (MSLS)''' is a 48 credit hour, two-year program. The MSLS curriculum trains students in the collection, organization, storage, and retrieval of recorded knowledge for a variety of institutions and groups.
*The '''Master of Science in Information Science''' '''(MSIS)''' Program is a 48 credit hour, two-year program. The MSIS curriculum trains students in the theory and practice of analyzing, organizing, representing and retrieving information.
*The '''Professional Science Master's (PSM) in Digital Curation''' is a 31 credit hour program. Students can take classes part-time or full-time and the program is completely online. The PSM in digital curation enables students to acquire the core skills, knowledge, and competencies for ensuring the longevity, authenticity, discoverability, and usability of digital assets.
*The '''Post-Masters Certificate in Information and Library Science''' is a 30 credit hour program intended for students who already hold a master's degree and who want to specialize or focus on a particular area within information and library science.
*The '''Doctor of Philosophy in Information and Library Science''' is a flexible and customizable course of study designed for individuals to work in academia and in high-level research centers.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/graduate&lt;/ref&gt;

====ARM====
The '''Concentration of Study in Archives and Record Management (ARM)''' at SILS provides students with the knowledge and skills required to work in archives, special collections, historical societies, records management units within organizations and various other curatorial environments. The principles and practices of ARM are based on provenance, collection-level arrangement, and attention to context, all of which are becoming increasingly relevant with the massive explosion of information across all sectors of society.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/arm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:UNC Kenan-Flagler McColl Building.jpg|thumb|right| Kenan-Flagler Business School, one of the many school SILS students can obtain dual degrees from.]]

===Other Programs===

====Dual Degrees====
In addition to the programs above, SILS also gives students the opportunity to pursue two master's degrees simultaneously. ''Art History'', ''Business Administration'', ''Government'', ''Health Policy'', ''Law'', ''Medicine'', ''Nursing'' and ''Public History'' are the degrees that SILS students can pursue simultaneously with their master's degree from SILS.  Students are required to apply to both schools separately, that they enroll in only one program in any given semester, that they confer with dual degree coordinators for both programs, and are able to "double count" up to 20% of credits across degrees. The goal of the dual degrees is to maximize learning, minimize course and content overlap, and provide students with a means to earn two degrees as efficiently as possible while maintaining the integrity and high standards of each degree and are designed to be completed in three academic years.

====Certificates====
The '''Post-Master's Certificate''' (PMC) is a post-master’s degree that is designed for practitioners who seek a continuing education program to enhance their professional development in Information and Library Science. The PMC is an hybrid program with residential and online components.  The typical pattern begins with a two-week intensive kick-off offered during the first session of summer school on campus and then includes a set of courses taken online. he PMC allows students to customize their coursework depending on their goals. The main requirement of the program is successful completion of an additional 30 hours of coursework.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/post-masters-certificates&lt;/ref&gt;

SILS also offers several certificate of specialization programs that allow currently enrolled master's students to develop strength in predefined areas of concentration in information and library science. Completion of the requirements for a certificate results in an endorsement on the student's transcript. These certificates are intended for students enrolled in the master's program, as well as those with master's degrees, who wish to acquire expertise in addition to the normal master's degree, and receive recognition for this training. Programs include Aging, Bioinformatics, Clinical Information Science, Digital Curation, among other specialized programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/certificates&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Opportunities===
The very first international summer semester in the Czech Republic, co-sponsored by Charles University, began in Prague in 2002 for SILS students.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Past" /&gt; Today, the school hosts seminars each year in London, England and Charles University in Prague, the Czech Republic. Exchange opportunities are also available at schools in Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Spain and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="SILS at a Glance" /&gt; The schools that SILS has formal study abroad agreements with are: [[Royal School of Library and Information Science]] in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], [[Charles University]] in [[Prague, Czech Republic]], The Department of Library Science, Information Science and Book Studies at the [[University of Ljubljana]] in [[Slovenia]], and the [[Charles III University of Madrid|University of Carlos III]] in [[Madrid, Spain]]. In addition, [[UNC-Chapel Hill]] has formal university ties with approximately 75 other universities—many of them with library and information science schools—where SILS students can spend a semester studying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://sils.unc.edu/programs/international&lt;/ref&gt;

==iSchool consortium==
UNC-SILS is a member of an international group of [[iSchools]]. The iSchools organization was founded in 2005 by a collective of Information Schools dedicated to advancing the information field in the 21st century. These schools, colleges, and departments have been newly created or are evolving from programs formerly focused on specific tracks such as information technology, library science, informatics, and information science. While each individual iSchool has its own strengths and specializations, together they share a fundamental interest in the relationships between information, people, and technology. The iSchools organization is governed by the iCaucus. Criteria for being recognized as an iSchool are not rigid, but schools are expected to have substantial sponsored research activity, engagement in the training of future researchers (usually through an active, research-oriented doctoral program), and a commitment to progress in the information field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischools.org/site/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words''''' was written by [[William Edwy Vine]] and published as a four volume set in 1940.  In common usage, the title is often shortened to '''''Vine's Expository Dictionary''''', or simply '''''Vine's'''''.  It is a cross-reference from key English words in the [[Authorized King James Version]] to the original words in the Greek texts of the New Testament.  In his preface to the book, Vine wrote, "The present volumes are produced especially for the help of those who do not study Greek, though it is hoped that those who are familiar with the original will find them useful."  
It provides a concise meaning of the original Greek word, often providing Bible verse references as examples.  If there are several Greek words that may translate to the same English word, Vine's distinguishes the shadings of meaning and connotation that may be lost in the English translation.  For example, there are a number of Greek words that may be translated by the English word '''''love'''''.

Vine's also provides the definition of a word (as used in the King James Version) more accurately than an English dictionary, because it expands the Greek use of the word. For example, the word, "godliness" in 1 Tim. 2:2 is defined in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary as "1: Divine 2: pious, devout -", but in Vines, it is defined as " 'to be devout,' denotes that piety which is characterized by a Godward attitude, does that which is well-pleasing to Him." So we have a fuller meaning of the word by seeing how the word is used in the NT.

Vine's can be used with [[Strong's Concordance]]. Every word is numbered with the equivalent Strong's number so you can use it more efficiently.  

Vine did not write an equivalent work for Old Testament Hebrew words; however, Vine's work is sometimes combined with another author's Hebrew dictionary and marketed under Vine's name as a "complete" expository dictionary. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatebiblereferencelibrary.com/Vines_Expositary_Dictionary.pdf ''Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtual heritage''' or '''cultural heritage and technology''' is the body of works dealing with information and communication technologies ([[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]]) and their application to [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''virtual [[archaeology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Bawaya|first = M.| title = Virtual Archaeologists Recreate Parts of Ancient Worlds | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 140–141 | year=2010 | doi = 10.1126/science.327.5962.140 | pmid=20056870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual heritage and cultural heritage have independent meanings: ''cultural heritage'' refers to sites, monuments, buildings and objects "with historical, aesthetic, archaeological, scientific, ethnological or anthropological value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/408 | title  = Application Guide  | author = [[UNESCO]] | year = 2008 | work = Applications to UNESCO-Vocations Patrimoine Fellowships for World Heritage site managers | publisher = [[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] | accessdate = 4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''virtual heritage'' refers to instances of these within a technological domain, usually involving [[Visualization (computer graphics)|computer visualization]] of artefacts or [[Virtual Reality]] environments.

One technology that is frequently employed in virtual heritage applications is [[augmented reality]], which is used to provide on-site reconstructions of archaeological sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archeoguide.intranet.gr/ | title  = ARCHEOGUIDE - Augmented Reality-based Cultural Heritage On-site Guide | year = 2002 | work = ARCHEOGUIDE Project | accessdate = 23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or artefacts.

Many virtual heritage projects focus on the tangible aspects of cultural heritage, for example [[3D modelling]], [[Computer graphics|graphics]] and [[Computer animation|animation]]. In doing so they often overlook the intangible aspects of cultural heritage associated with objects and sites, such as stories, performances and dances. The tangible aspects of cultural heritage are not inseparable from the intangible and one method for combining them is the use of virtual heritage [[serious game]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Anderson|first1 = E.

==First use==
The first use of virtual heritage as a museum exhibit, and the derivation of the name [[virtual tour]], was in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csanet.org/newsletter/feb95/nl029504.html | title  = Imaging The Past  | author = Susan S. Lukesh | date = Feb 1995 | work = CSA Newsletter, Feb. '95 | publisher = Center for the Study of Architecture | accessdate = 3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a museum visitor interpretation, providing a 'walk-through' of a [[3D reconstruction]] of [[Dudley Castle]] in [[England]] as it was in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Boland|first1 = P.|last2 = Johnson|first2 = C.|editor1-last = Higgins|editor1-first = T.|editor2-last = Main|editor2-first = P.|editor3-last = Lang|editor3-first = J.|contribution = Archaeology as computer visualization: 'Virtual tours' of Dudley Castle c. 1550|title = Imaging the Past: Electronic Imaging and Computer Graphics in Museums and Archaeology| series = Occasional Papers |volume = 114 |publisher = 
[[British Museum#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |pages= 227–234 |year=1996 | isbn = 0-86159-114-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc based system designed by British-based engineer Colin Johnson. It is a little-known fact that one of the first users of Virtual Heritage was [[Queen Elizabeth II]], when she officially opened the visitor centre in June 1994.
Because the Queen's officials had requested titles, descriptions and instructions of all activities, the system was named 'Virtual Tour', being a cross between [[virtual reality]] and Royal Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exrenda.com/dudley/index.htm|title=Virtual Tours of Dudley Castle archive|author=Colin Johnson|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
