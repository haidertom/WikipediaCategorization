'''2D computer graphics''' is the [[computer]]-based generation of [[digital image]]s&amp;mdash;mostly from two-dimensional models (such as [[2D geometric model]]s, text, and digital images) and by techniques specific to them.The word may stand for the branch of [[computer science]] that comprises such techniques or for the models themselves.

[[File:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]
2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional [[printing]] and [[drawing]] technologies, such as [[typography]], [[cartography]], [[technical drawing]], [[advertising]], etc.  In those applications, the two-dimensional [[image]] is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred, because they give more direct control of the image than [[3D computer graphics]] (whose approach is more akin to [[photography]] than to typography).

In many domains, such as [[desktop publishing]], [[engineering]], and [[business]], a description of a document based on 2D computer graphics techniques can be much smaller than the corresponding digital image&amp;mdash;often by a factor of 1/1000 or more.  This representation is also more flexible since it can be [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] at different [[Image resolution|resolution]]s to suit different [[output device]]s.  For these reasons, documents and illustrations are often stored or transmitted as [[graphics file format|2D graphic files]].

2D computer graphics started in the 1950s, based on [[vector graphics|vector graphics devices]]. These were largely supplanted by [[raster graphics|raster-based devices]] in the following decades. The [[PostScript]] language and the [[X Window System]] protocol were landmark developments in the field.

==2D graphics techniques==
2D graphics models may combine [[2D geometric model|geometric model]]s (also called [[vector graphics]]), digital images (also called [[raster graphics]]), text to be [[typesetting|typeset]] (defined by content, [[Typeface|font]] style and size, color, position, and orientation), mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]]s and [[equation]]s, and more.  These components can be modified and manipulated by two-dimensional [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]], [[rotation]], [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]].
In [[object-oriented graphics]], the image is described indirectly by an [[object (computer science)|object]] endowed with a self-[[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] [[method (computer science)|method]]&amp;mdash;a procedure which assigns colors to the image [[pixel]]s by an arbitrary algorithm.  Complex models can be built by combining simpler objects, in the [[paradigms]] of [[object-oriented programming]].

[[File:Traslazione OK.svg|right|thumb|A translation moves every point of a figure or a space by the same amount in a given direction.]]
[[File:Simx2=transl OK.svg|right|thumb|A [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] against an axis followed by a reflection against a second axis parallel to the first one results in a total motion which is a translation.]]

In [[Euclidean geometry]], a '''translation''' moves every point a constant distance in a specified direction. A translation can be described as a [[Euclidean group|rigid motion]]: other rigid motions include rotations and reflections. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant [[vector space|vector]] to every point, or as shifting the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of the [[coordinate system]]. A '''translation operator''' is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] &lt;math&gt;T_\mathbf{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T_\mathbf{\delta} f(\mathbf{v}) = f(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{\delta}).&lt;/math&gt;

If '''v''' is a fixed vector, then the translation ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt; will work as ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''p''') = '''p''' + '''v'''.

If ''T'' is a translation, then the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a subset ''A'' under the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''T'' is the '''translate''' of ''A'' by ''T''. The translate of ''A'' by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt; is often written ''A'' + '''v'''.

In a [[Euclidean space]], any translation is an [[isometry]]. The set of all translations forms the translation group ''T'', which is isomorphic to the space itself, and a [[normal subgroup]] of [[Euclidean group]] ''E''(''n'' ). The [[quotient group]] of ''E''(''n'' ) by ''T'' is isomorphic to the [[orthogonal group]] ''O''(''n'' ):
:''E''(''n'' ) ''/ T'' ≅ ''O''(''n'' ).

== Translation ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Affine transformation]] --&gt;

Since a translation is an [[affine transformation]] but not a [[linear transformation]], [[homogeneous coordinates]] are normally used to represent the translation operator by a [[matrix (math)|matrix]] and thus to make it linear. Thus we write the 3-dimensional vector '''w''' = (''w''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;) using 4 homogeneous coordinates as '''w''' = (''w''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Paul, 1981, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UzZ3LAYqvRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Robot manipulators: mathematics, programming, and control : the computer control of robot manipulators], MIT Press, Cambridge, MA&lt;/ref&gt;

To translate an object by a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] '''v''', each homogeneous vector '''p''' (written in homogeneous coordinates) would need to be multiplied by this '''translation matrix''':

: &lt;math&gt; T_{\mathbf{v}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_x \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; v_y \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; v_z \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:
: &lt;math&gt; T_{\mathbf{v}} \mathbf{p} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_x \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; v_y\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; v_z\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
p_x + v_x \\ p_y + v_y \\ p_z + v_z \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
= \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of a translation matrix can be obtained by reversing the direction of the vector:
: &lt;math&gt; T^{-1}_{\mathbf{v}} = T_{-\mathbf{v}} . \! &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the product of translation matrices is given by adding the vectors:
: &lt;math&gt; T_{\mathbf{u}}T_{\mathbf{v}} = T_{\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}} . \! &lt;/math&gt;
Because addition of vectors is [[commutative]], multiplication of translation matrices is therefore also commutative (unlike multiplication of arbitrary matrices).

==Rotation==

In [[linear algebra]], a '''rotation matrix''' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that is used to perform a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] in [[Euclidean space]].

:&lt;math&gt;R = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

rotates points in the ''xy''-[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]] counterclockwise through an angle ''θ'' about the origin of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. To perform the rotation using a rotation matrix ''R'', the position of each point must be represented by a [[column vector]] '''v''', containing the coordinates of the point. A rotated vector is obtained by using the [[matrix multiplication]] ''R'''''v'''. Since matrix multiplication has no effect on the zero vector (i.e., on the coordinates of the origin), rotation matrices can only be used to describe rotations about the origin of the coordinate system.

Rotation matrices provide a simple algebraic description of such rotations, and are used extensively for computations in [[geometry]], [[physics]], and [[computer graphics]]. In 2-dimensional space, a rotation can be simply described by an [[Angle of rotation|angle ''θ'' of rotation]], but it can be also represented by the 4 entries of a rotation matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns. In 3-dimensional space, every rotation can be interpreted as a rotation by a given angle about a single fixed axis of rotation (see [[Euler's rotation theorem]]), and hence it can be simply described by [[Axis-angle representation|an angle and a vector]] with 3 entries. However, it can also be represented by the 9 entries of a rotation matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns. The notion of rotation is not commonly used in dimensions higher than&amp;nbsp;3; there is a notion of a '''rotational displacement''', which can be represented by a matrix, but no associated single axis or angle.

Rotation matrices are [[square matrix|square matrices]], with [[real number|real]] entries. More specifically they can be characterized as [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] with [[determinant]]&amp;nbsp;1:

:&lt;math&gt;R^{T} = R^{-1}, \det R = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all such matrices of size ''n'' forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], known as the [[special orthogonal group]] {{math|SO(''n'')}}.

==In two dimensions==
[[File:Counterclockwise rotation SVG.svg|thumb|A counterclockwise rotation of a vector through angle ''θ''. The vector is initially aligned with the x-axis.]]
In two dimensions every rotation matrix has the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This rotates [[column vector]]s by means of the following [[matrix multiplication]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

So the coordinates (x',y') of the point (x,y) after rotation are:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;y' = x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The direction of vector rotation is counterclockwise if θ is positive (e.g. 90°), and clockwise if θ is negative (e.g. -90°).

:&lt;math&gt;
R(-\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta \\
-\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Non-standard orientation of the coordinate system===

[[File:Clockwise rotation SVG.svg|thumb|A rotation through angle ''θ'' with non-standard axes.]]
If a standard [[Orientation (mathematics)|right-handed]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is used, with the ''x'' axis to the right and the ''y'' axis up, the rotation R(''θ'') is counterclockwise. If a left-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used, with ''x'' directed to the right but ''y'' directed down, R(''θ'') is clockwise.  Such non-standard orientations are rarely used in mathematics but are common in 2D computer graphics, which often have the origin in the top left corner and the ''y''-axis down the screen or page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#InitialCoordinateSystem|title=Scalable Vector Graphics -- the initial coordinate system|author=W3C recommendation|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|below]] for other alternative conventions which may change the sense of the rotation produced by a rotation matrix.

===Common rotations===

Particularly useful are the matrices for 90° and 180° rotations:
:&lt;math&gt;
R(90^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\[3pt]
1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; (90° counterclockwise rotation)
:&lt;math&gt;R(180^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\[3pt]
0 &amp; -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; (180° rotation in either direction – a half-turn)
:&lt;math&gt;R(270^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \\[3pt]
-1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; (270° counterclockwise rotation, the same as a 90° clockwise rotation)

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}
In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''uniform scaling''' ('''[[isotropic]] scaling''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PowerPoint|last1=Durand|last2=Cutler|url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/classes/6.837/F03/lectures/04_transformations.ppt |title=Transformations|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate =12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''homogeneous dilation''', [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]]) is a [[linear transformation]] that enlarges (increases) or shrinks (diminishes) objects by a [[scale factor]] that is the same in all directions. The result of uniform scaling is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] (in the geometric sense) to the original.  A scale factor of 1 is normally allowed, so that congruent shapes are also classed as similar. (Some school text books specifically exclude this possibility, just as some exclude squares from being rectangles or circles from being ellipses.)

More general is '''scaling''' with a separate scale factor for each axis direction. '''Non-uniform scaling''' ('''[[anisotropic]] scaling''', '''inhomogeneous dilation''') is obtained when at least one of the scaling factors is different from the others; a special case is '''directional scaling''' or '''stretching''' (in one direction). Non-uniform scaling changes the [[shape]] of the object; e.g. a square may change into a rectangle, or into a parallelogram if the sides of the square are not parallel to the scaling axes (the angles between lines parallel to the axes are preserved, but not all angles).

==Scaling==
A scaling can be represented by a scaling matrix.  To scale an object by a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] ''v'' = (''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''), each point ''p'' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') would need to be multiplied with this scaling matrix:
:&lt;math&gt; S_v = 
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; v_y &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_z  \\
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:
:&lt;math&gt;
S_vp =
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; v_y &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_z  \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_xp_x \\ v_yp_y \\ v_zp_z
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Such a scaling changes the [[diameter]] of an object by a factor between the scale factors, the [[area]] by a factor between the smallest and the largest product of two scale factors, and the [[volume]] by the product of all three.

The scaling is uniform [[if and only if]] the scaling factors are equal (''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''). If all except one of the scale factors are equal to 1, we have directional scaling.

In the case where ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = k'', the scaling is also called an '''enlargement''' or '''[[Dilation (metric space)|dilation]]''' by a factor k, increasing the area by a factor of k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the volume by a factor of k&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

A scaling in the most general sense is any [[affine transformation]] with a [[diagonalizable matrix]]. It includes the case that the three directions of scaling are not perpendicular. It includes also the case that one or more scale factors are equal to zero ([[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]]), and the case of one or more negative scale factors. The latter corresponds to a combination of scaling proper and a kind of reflection: along lines in a particular direction we take the reflection in the point of intersection with a plane that need not be perpendicular; therefore it is more general than ordinary reflection in the plane.

==Using homogeneous coordinates==
In [[projective geometry]], often used in [[computer graphics]], points are represented using [[homogeneous coordinates]]. To scale an object by a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] ''v'' = (''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''), each homogeneous coordinate vector ''p'' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', 1) would need to be multiplied with this [[projective transformation]] matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; S_v = 
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; v_y &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_z &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:
:&lt;math&gt;
S_vp =
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; v_y &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_z &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \\ 1 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_xp_x \\ v_yp_y \\ v_zp_z \\ 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the last component of a homogeneous coordinate can be viewed as the denominator of the other three components, a uniform scaling by a common factor ''s'' (uniform scaling) can be accomplished by using this scaling matrix:
:&lt;math&gt; S_v = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{s} 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For each vector ''p'' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', 1) we would have
:&lt;math&gt;
S_vp =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{s}  
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \\ 1 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \\ \frac{1}{s} 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which would be homogenized to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
sp_x \\ sp_y \\ sp_z \\ 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Direct painting===
A convenient way to create a complex image is to start with a blank "canvas" [[raster graphics|raster map]] (an array of [[pixel]]s, also known as a [[bitmap]]) filled with some uniform [[background color]] and then "draw", "paint" or "paste" simple patches of color onto it, in an appropriate order. In particular the canvas may be the [[frame buffer]] for a [[computer display]].

Some programs will set the pixel colors directly, but most will rely on some 2D [[graphics library]] or the machine's [[graphics card]], which usually implement the following operations:

* paste a given [[digital image|image]] at a specified offset onto the canvas;
* write a string of characters with a specified font, at a given position and angle;
* paint a simple [[geometric shape]], such as a [[triangle]] defined by three corners, or a [[circle]] with given center and radius;
* draw a [[line segment]], [[Arc (geometry)|arc]], or simple curve with a ''virtual pen'' of given width.
&lt;!-- limitations --&gt;

===Extended color models===
Text, shapes and lines are rendered with a client-specified color. Many libraries and cards provide [[color gradient]]s, which are handy for the generation of smoothly-varying backgrounds, shadow effects, etc. (See also [[Gouraud shading]]).  The pixel colors can also be taken from a texture, e.g. a [[digital image]] (thus emulating rub-on [[screentone]]s and the fabled ''checker paint'' which used to be available only in [[cartoon]]s).

Painting a [[pixel]] with a given color usually replaces its previous color. However, many systems support painting with [[Transparency (graphic)|transparent]] and [[translucent]] colors, which only modify the previous pixel values.  
&lt;!--should elaborate: modify by mixing (weighted average) or by filtering (multiplication) --&gt;
The two colors may also be combined in more complex ways, e.g. by computing their [[bitwise operation|bitwise]] [[exclusive or]].  This technique is known as''inverting color'' or ''color inversion'', and is often used in [[graphical user interface]]s for highlighting, rubber-band drawing, and other volatile painting&amp;mdash;since re-painting the same shapes with the same color will restore the original pixel values.  &lt;!-- limitations --&gt;

===Layers===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Layer]] --&gt;

[[File:BabyAnimation.png|thumb|A 2D animated character [[Compositing|composited]] with 3D backgrounds using layers.]]

{{main|Layers (digital image editing)}}
The models used in 2D computer graphics usually do not provide for three-dimensional shapes, or three-dimensional optical phenomena such as lighting, [[shadow]]s, [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], etc. However, they usually can model multiple ''layers'' (conceptually of ink, paper, or film; opaque, [[translucent]], or [[Transparency (graphic)|transparent]]&amp;mdash;stacked in a specific order. The ordering is usually defined by a single number (the layer's  ''depth'', or distance from the viewer).

Layered models are sometimes called ''2½-D computer graphics''. They make it possible to mimic traditional drafting and printing techniques based on film and paper, such as cutting and pasting; and allow the user to edit any layer without affecting the others. For these reasons, they are used in most [[graphics editor]]s. Layered models also allow better [[spatial anti-aliasing]] of complex drawings and provide a sound model for certain techniques such as ''mitered joints'' and the [[even-odd rule]].

Layered models are also used to allow the user to suppress unwanted information when viewing or printing a document, e.g. roads or railways from a [[map]], certain process layers from an [[integrated circuit]] diagram, or hand annotations from a business letter.

In a layer-based model, the target image is produced by "painting" or "pasting" each layer, in order of decreasing depth, on the virtual canvas. Conceptually, each layer is first [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] on its own, yielding a [[digital image]] with the desired [[Image resolution|resolution]] which is then painted over the canvas, pixel by pixel.  Fully transparent parts of a layer need not be rendered, of course. The rendering and painting may be done in parallel, i.e., each layer pixel may be painted on the canvas as soon as it is produced by the rendering procedure.

Layers that consist of complex geometric objects (such as [[String (computer science)|text]] or [[polyline]]s) may be broken down into simpler elements ([[Character (computing)|character]]s or [[line segment]]s, respectively), which are then painted as separate layers, in some order. However, this solution may create undesirable [[aliasing]] artifacts wherever two elements overlap the same pixel.

==2D graphics hardware==
{{See also|Video display controller|List of home computers by video hardware|Sprite (computer graphics)}}

Modern computer [[graphics card]] displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of [[pixel]]s, due to the relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for [[BitBLT|blitting]] operations or [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] drawing. A [[co-processor]] dedicated to [[BitBLT|blitting]] is known as a ''[[Blitter]] chip''.

Classic 2D [[graphics chip]]s and [[graphics processing unit]]s of the late 1970s to 1980s, used in [[8-bit]] to early [[16-bit]], [[arcade game]]s, [[video game console]]s, and [[home computer]]s, include:

*[[Atari]]'s [[Television Interface Adapter|TIA]], [[ANTIC]], [[Color Television Interface Adapter|CTIA]] and [[George's Television Interface Adapter|GTIA]]
*[[Capcom]]'s [[CP System|CPS-A and CPS-B]]
*[[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[Original Chip Set|OCS]]
*[[MOS Technology]]'s [[MOS Technology VIC|VIC]] and [[MOS Technology VIC-II|VIC-II]]
*[[Fujitsu]]'s [[Video display controller|MB14241]]
*[[Hudson Soft]]'s [[X68000#Technical specifications|Cynthia]] and [[Hudson Soft HuC6270|HuC6270]]

*[[Ricoh]]'s [[Picture Processing Unit|PPU]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System technical specifications|S-PPU]]
*[[Sega]]'s [[Video display controller|VDP]], [[Sega Space Harrier|Super Scaler]], [[Sega System 16|315-5011/315-5012]] and [[Sega System 16|315-5196/315-5197]]
*[[Texas Instruments]]' [[Texas Instruments TMS9918|TMS9918]]
*[[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]]'s [[Yamaha V9938|V9938]], [[Yamaha V9958|V9958]] and [[Mega Drive#Technical specifications|YM7101 VDP]]

==2D graphics software==
Many [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs), including [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], or the [[X Window System]], are primarily based on 2D graphical concepts. Such software provides a visual environment for interacting with the computer, and commonly includes some form of [[window manager]] to aid the user in conceptually distinguishing between different applications. 
The user interface within individual software applications is typically 2D in nature as well, due in part to the fact that most common [[input device]]s, such as the [[computer mouse|mouse]], are constrained to two dimensions of movement.

2D graphics are very important in the control peripherals such as printers, plotters, sheet cutting machines, etc. They were also used in most early [[video game]]s; and are still used for card and board games such as [[solitaire]], [[chess]], [[mahjongg]], etc.

2D graphics editors or ''drawing programs'' are application-level software for the creation of images, diagrams and illustrations by direct manipulation (through the mouse, [[graphics tablet]], or similar device) of 2D computer graphics primitives. These editors generally provide [[2D geometric primitive|geometric primitives]] as well as [[digital image]]s; and some even support procedural models.  The illustration is usually represented internally as a layered model, often with a hierarchical structure to make editing more convenient. These editors generally output [[graphics file format|graphics files]] where the layers and primitives are separately preserved in their original form. [[MacDraw]], introduced in 1984 with the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] line of computers, was an early example of this class;  recent examples are the commercial products [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[CorelDRAW]], and the free editors such as [[xfig]] or [[Inkscape]]. There are also many 2D graphics editors specialized for certain types of drawings such as electrical, electronic and VLSI diagrams, topographic maps, computer fonts, etc.

[[Digital image processing|Image editors]] are specialized for the manipulation of [[digital image]]s, mainly by means of free-hand drawing/painting and [[signal processing]] operations.  They typically use a direct-painting paradigm, where the user controls virtual pens, brushes, and other free-hand artistic instruments to apply paint to a virtual canvas.  Some image editors support a multiple-layer model; however, in order to support signal-processing operations like blurring each layer is normally represented as a digital image. Therefore, any geometric primitives that are provided by the editor are immediately converted to pixels and painted onto the canvas. The name ''raster graphics editor'' is sometimes used to contrast this approach to that of general editors  which also handle ''vector graphics''.  One of the first popular image editors was [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[MacPaint]], companion to [[MacDraw]].  Modern examples are the free [[GIMP]] editor, and the commercial products [[Photoshop]] and [[Paint Shop Pro]].  This class too includes many specialized editors &amp;mdash; for medicine, remote sensing, [[digital photography]], etc.

'''Algorithmic game theory''' is an area in the intersection of [[game theory]] and [[computer science]], whose objective is to understand and design algorithms in [[Strategy (game theory)|strategic]] environments. Typically, in Algorithmic Game Theory problems, the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output. In those situations, the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests. On top of the usual requirements in classical algorithm design, say ''polynomial-time running time'', ''good approximation ratio'', ... the designer must also care about incentive constraints. We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives:

* ''Analysis'': look at the current implemented algorithms and analyze them using Game Theory tools: calculate and prove properties on their [[Nash equilibria]], [[price of anarchy]], best-response dynamics ...
* ''Design'': design games that have both good game-theoretical and algorithmic properties. This area is called [[algorithmic mechanism design]].

==History==
===Nisan-Ronen: a new framework for studying algorithms===

In 1999, the seminal paper of [[Noam Nisan|Nisan]] and Ronen &lt;ref name="nr"&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Nisan | first1 = Noam | author1-link = Noam Nisan
 | last2 = Ronen | first2 = Amir
 | contribution = Algorithmic mechanism design
 | doi = 10.1145/301250.301287
 | pages = 129–140
 | title = Proceedings of the 31st ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC '99)
 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; drew the attention of the Theoretical Computer Science community to designing algorithms for selfish (strategic) users. As they claim in the abstract:

{{Quote|We consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants cannot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents’ interests are best served by behaving correctly.

Following notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism. The payments should be carefully chosen as to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes. We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in particular to the shortest path problem.}}

This paper coined the term [[algorithmic mechanism design]] and was recognized by the 2012 [[Gödel Prize]] committee as one of "three papers laying foundation of growth in Algorithmic Game Theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Price of Anarchy===
{{main article|Price of Anarchy}}
The other two papers cited in the 2012 Gödel Prize for fundamental contributions to Algorithmic Game Theory introduced and developed the concept of "Price of Anarchy". 
In their 1999 paper "Worst-case Equilibria",&lt;ref name = "kp"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Worst-case Equilibria|first=Elias|last=Koutsoupias|first2=Christos|last2=Papadimitriou|journal=Computer Science Review|volume=3|issue=2|date=May 2009|pages=65–69|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/nash.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koutsoupias and [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] proposed a new measure of the degradation of system efficiency due to the selfish behavior of its agents: the ratio of between system efficiency at an optimal configuration, and its efficiency at the worst Nash equilibrium. 
(The term "Price of Anarchy" only appeared a couple of years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===The Internet as a catalyst===
The Internet created a new economy—both as a foundation for exchange and commerce, and in its own right. The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy. On the other hand, the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many. This was new to the classic, ‘top-down’ approach to computation that held till then. Thus, game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it, both human and mechanical.

Game theory studies equilibria (such as the [[Nash equilibrium]]). An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy. Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet, for instance financial interactions and communication load-balancing{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria, and a common approach is then to ‘find the game’—that is, to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game, and to derive the associated equilibria.

Rephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet-based interactions and the construction of mechanisms to meet specified demands. If equilibria can be shown to exist, a further question must be answered: can an equilibrium be found, and in reasonable time? This leads to the [[analysis of algorithms]] for finding equilibria. Of special importance is the complexity class [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD]], which includes many problems in algorithmic game theory.

==Areas of research==
The main areas of research in algorithmic game theory include:

* [[Algorithmic mechanism design]]
* Inefficiency of equilibria ([[price of anarchy]], [[price of stability]])
* [[Computational complexity theory|Complexity]] of finding equilibria
* [[Market equilibrium]]
* [[Multi-agent systems]]
* [[Computational social choice]]

And the area counts with diverse practical applications:

* [[Routing]]
* [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] systems
* [[Sponsored search auction|Sponsored search auctions]]

'''American College of the Building Arts''' (ACBA) is a private four-year liberal arts and sciences college located in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. It is licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to grant a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in six craft specializations in the building arts.

The college's model is unique in the United States, with its focus on total integration of a liberal arts and science education and the traditional building arts skills. Students choose from among six craft specializations: [[timber framing]], [[carpentry|architectural carpentry]], [[plaster]], [[masonry]], [[blacksmith]]ing (forged architectural iron) and [[stone carving|architectural stone carving]].

ACBA's stated mission is to educate and train [[artisan]]s in the traditional building arts in order to foster exceptional craftsmanship and encourage the preservation, enrichment and understanding of the world's architectural heritage through a liberal arts and science education.

[[File:American College of the Building Arts junior measuring for a custom stair.jpg|thumb|American College of the Building Arts junior measuring for a custom stair.]]
Current students come from more than 30 states. One quarter of the student body is female and one fifth are veterans. The majority of students have secured employment in their respective trades prior to graduation, aided by expertise gained from their education and externship experiences, critical analysis and deep knowledge base in preservation, restoration and appropriate materials needed in each of their chosen fields. The [[interdisciplinary]] approach allows graduates to be as educated as the architects with whom they work.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:American-College-of-the-Building-Arts-library.jpg|thumb|left|American College of the Building Arts library interior.]]American College of the Building Arts was founded in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]], which struck the Southeastern coast of the United States in 1989. The devastating category four hurricane damaged or destroyed many historical coastal-Carolina buildings and left much of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston's]] iron, plaster and fine wood work in disrepair. It took ten years to rebuild and restore the city's damaged homes and historical buildings, in part, because of a shortage of skilled artisans. In 1999, in response to this gap in the building arts, a group of local movers and shakers planted the seeds that led to the founding of ACBA.

Initially, classes and workshops that focused on the building arts were offered at a number of different Charleston area locations. However, the original educational model proved difficult to execute, and the college founders regrouped to establish a degree-granting college, integrating the American liberal arts degree model with the artisan teaching styles of Europe. In 2004, ACBA was licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to recruit students for a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in the building arts. In 2009 the college awarded its first degrees to seven students. During these same years, ACBA reconfigured its administration, hiring current president, Lt.(ret.) General Colby M. Broadwater III and other administrative team members with strong business experience.

== Academics ==
[[File:American College of the Building Arts student working with steel.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Student at the American College of the Building Arts working with steel.]]American College of the Building Arts combines a traditional liberal arts education with programs in trade education that are based on [[Europe]]an and other models. The framing and plaster programs are based on the French [[Compagnons du Tour de France|“les Compagnons du Devoir,”]] a trade guild offering high-skill vocational and educational training rich in culture and humanity. The stone program is based on programs at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and [[Wells Cathedral]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The iron program has a long association with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and also with the work of [[Philip Simmons]], famed [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] ironwork artisan and one of the founders of ACBA. Pieces designed and made by Simmons are displayed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[South Carolina State Museum]] and outside the United States in [[France]] and [[China]]. In addition to trade-specific classes, students pursue a course of general studies that includes not only typical college courses, such as English and mathematics, but also specialized courses in drawing, design, materials science and construction management. ACBA maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio to ensure the highest standards of quality in its programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.JPG|thumb|American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.]]

The Byrne-Diderot Library is a major research resource for students and faculty. The library houses a specialized collection of books, periodicals, newspapers and audiovisual materials in the building, visual, decorative and liberal arts. The library's main collection contains over 6.500 items. The D.A.R. Special Collections room contains another 500 rare books, catalogs and periodicals, as well as examples of historical tools and 19th century Charleston iron work.

==Campus history ==
[[File:American College of the Building Arts junior carving a stone mantle.jpg|thumb|American College of the Building Arts junior carving a stone mantle.]]American College of the Building Arts first classes were offered at several different locations in and around the city of Charleston, including the [[Old Charleston Jail|Old Charleston District Jail]], which became the college's primary location for 17 years. Carpentry and forged architectural iron programs were housed at a separate site. The Jail was originally constructed in 1802 and expanded in 1855 to include living quarters for the warden and jailers on the street side and an octagonal rear wing. Many infamous inmates were housed in the prison, including high seas pirates, the female mass murderer Lavinia Fischer and [[Denmark Vesey]], a free African American who plotted a slave rebellion that was discovered before it could be executed. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] both [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners were incarcerated within its walls. Although it had no electricity or running water, the jail housed prisoners until it was decommissioned in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/charleston/old.htm&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Groundbreaking with Mayor Riley.jpg|thumb|left|American College of the Building Arts ground breaking of the Old Charleston Trolley Barn on May 7, 2015.]]

During the years spent occupying and renovating the jail, the college viewed itself as caretaker of the building and its rich history. As part of ACBA's living learning laboratory, faculty members led students in assessing needs and proper methods of restoration, preservation and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/september-october/hands-on-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Having outgrown its existing facilities, ACBA launched a major fundraising effort in 2014 to establish a single, expanded campus that could consolidate the teaching of all trades under one roof. With a major donation from Parallel Capital and from Russell and Betty Joan Hitt, founders of Virginia-based HITT Contracting, early supporters of ACBA, the college raised funds to purchase and renovate the abandoned Charleston Trolley Barn on Upper Meeting Street. On May 7, 2015, 150 people attended the ground breaking ceremony.

It took just over one year and approximately $6 million to build the new state-of-the-art ACBA campus that was formally opened in October 2016. The newly repurposed building maintains the historical ethos of the original structure while providing the students with modern academic and workshop space. Approximately 39,000 square feet were carved out of the barn's original 24,000 square foot footprint. The front third of the three-story building houses an exhibition lobby, administrative offices, classrooms, labs and a community room available to local civic groups. Workshops and trade classrooms are located in the back two-thirds of the building. A student lounge, faculty offices and conference spaces occupy the second floor. The third floor rafters house the computer lab and ACBA's unique library and its special collections.  The building has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In September 2018, the College received national accreditation from the [http://www.accsc.org/ Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges].

==Additional Programs==
A diverse lineup of evening courses was introduced to the public beginning in the fall of 2017, including AutoCAD, interior design and history of Charleston architecture. In January 2018, ACBA initiated intensive one-week courses in areas such as sculptural blacksmithing, decorative woodcarving, furniture restoration, furniture design and stained glass. In the fall of 2018, the addition of an undergraduate major in classical architecture and design will bring the list of ACBA majors up to seven.

'''Biogenic silica''' (bSi), also referred to as [[opal]], biogenic opal, or [[amorphous]] opaline [[silica]], forms one of the most widespread biogenic [[minerals]]. For example, microscopic particles of silica called [[phytolith]]s can be found in grasses and other plants. Silica is an amorphous metal [[oxide]] formed by complex [[inorganic]] [[polymerization]] processes. This is opposed to the other major [[biogenic]] minerals, comprising [[carbonate]] and [[phosphate]], which occur in nature as crystalline iono-covalent solids (e.g. [[salts]]) whose [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] is dictated by [[Solubility equilibrium|solubility equilibria]].&lt;ref&gt;Coradin, T., Lopez, P.J. (2003). "Biogenic Silica Patterning: Simple Chemistry or Subtle Biology?" ChemBioChem 3: 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, bSi is [[hydrated silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which is essential to many plants and animals.

==Silica in marine environments==
[[Silicate]], or [[silicic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), is an important [[nutrient]] in the ocean. Unlike the other major nutrients such as [[phosphate]], [[nitrate]], or [[ammonium]], which are needed by almost all marine [[plankton]], silicate is an essential chemical requirement for very specific [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], including [[diatoms]], [[radiolaria]], silicoflagellates, and [[siliceous sponge]]s. These organisms extract dissolved silicate from open ocean surface waters for the buildup of their particulate silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or opaline, skeletal structures (i.e. the biota’s hard parts).&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;Boggs, S. (2005). "Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (4th Edition)". Pearson Education, Inc, 662p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM1981"&gt;DeMaster, D.J. (1981)."The supply and accumulation of silica in the marine environment". Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 45: 1715-1732.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common siliceous structures observed at the cell surface of silica-secreting organisms include: spicules, scales, solid plates, granules, frustules, and other elaborate geometric forms, depending on the species considered.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;Ehrlich et al. (2010). "Modern Views on Desilicification: Biosilica and Abiotic Silica Dissolution in Natural and Artificial Environments ". Chem. Rev. 110: 4656-4689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five major sources of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] silica to the marine environment can be distinguished:&lt;ref name="DM1981"/&gt; 
* [[Riverine]] influx of dissolved silica to the oceans: 4.2 ± 0.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Submarine volcanism and associated [[hydrothermal]] emanations: 1.9 ± 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Glacial [[weathering]]: 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Low temperature submarine weathering of oceanic [[basalt]]s
* Some silica may also escape from silica-enriched pore waters of [[pelagic sediments]] on the [[seafloor]]

Once the organism has perished, part of the siliceous skeletal material [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolves]], as it settles through the [[water column]], enriching the deep waters with dissolved silica.&lt;ref name="DM1981"/&gt; Some of the siliceous scales can also be preserved over time as [[microfossils]] in [[deep-sea]] [[sediments]], providing a window into modern and ancient [[plankton]]/[[protists]] communities.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt; This biologic process has operated, since at least early [[Paleozoic]] time, to regulate the balance of silica in the ocean: Radiolarians ([[Cambrian]]/[[Ordovician]]-[[Holocene]]), [[diatoms]] ([[Cretaceous]]-[[Holocene]]), and silicoflagellates ([[Cretaceous]]-[[Holocene]]) form the ocean’s main contributors to the global silica biogenic cycle throughout [[geologic time]]. Diatoms account for 43% of the ocean primary production, and are responsible for the bulk of silica extraction from ocean waters in the modern ocean, and during much of the past fifty million years. In contrast, oceans of [[Jurassic]] and older ages, were characterized by [[radiolarians]] as major silica-utilizing phyla.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt; Nowadays, radiolarians are the second (after diatoms) major producers of suspended amorphous silica in ocean waters. Their distribution ranges from the [[Arctic]] to the [[Antarctic]], being most abundant in the equatorial zone. In equatorial [[Pacific]] waters, for example, about 16,000 specimens per cubic meter can be observed.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt;

Silicate cycling gained increasingly in scientific attention the past decade because of following reasons. Firstly, the modern [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] silica cycle is widely believed to be dominated by diatoms for the fixation and export of [[Suspended solids|particulate matter]] (including [[Organic matter|organic]] [[carbon]]), from the [[euphotic zone]] to the deep ocean, via a process known as the [[biological pump]].  As a result, diatoms, and other silica-secreting organisms, play a crucial role in the global [[carbon cycle]], and have the ability to affect [[atmospheric]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations on a variety of time scales, by [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the ocean. This connection between ''biogenic silica'' and organic carbon, together with the significantly higher preservation potential of biogenic siliceous compounds, compared to organic carbon, makes opal accumulation records very interesting for [[paleoceanography]] and [[paleoclimatology]]. Secondly, biogenic silica accumulation on the sea floor contains lot of information about where in the ocean [[export production]] has occurred on time scales ranging from hundreds to millions of years. For this reason, opal deposition records provide valuable information regarding large-scale oceanographic reorganizations in the geological past, as well as paleoproductivity. And last, the mean oceanic [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] for silicate is approximately 10,000–15,000 yr. This relative short residence time, makes oceanic silicate concentrations and fluxes sensitive to [[glacial]]/[[interglacial]] perturbations, and thus an excellent [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for evaluating climate changes.&lt;ref name="DM1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortese"&gt;Cortese, G., Gersonde, R. (2004). "Opal sedimentation shifts in the World Ocean over the last 15 Myr". Earth and Planetary Science Letters 224: 509-527.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of diatoms and other silica-utilizing organisms are found, as opal sediments within pelagic deep-sea deposits. [[Pelagic sediments]], containing significant quantities of siliceous biogenic remains, are commonly referred to as [[siliceous ooze]]. Siliceous ooze are particularly abundant in the modern ocean at high latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres. A striking feature of siliceous ooze distribution is a ca. 200&amp;nbsp;km wide belt stretching across the [[Southern Ocean]]. Some equatorial regions of [[upwelling]], where [[nutrients]] are abundant and [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] is high, are also characterized by local siliceous ooze. Siliceous oozes are composed primarily of the remains of diatoms and radiolarians, but may also include other siliceous organisms, such as silicoflagellates and [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s. Diatom ooze occurs mainly in high-latitude areas and along some continental margins, whereas radiolarian ooze are more characteristic of equatorial areas. Siliceous ooze are modified and transformed during burial into bedded [[chert]]s.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

Diatoms in both fresh and salt water extract silica from the water to use as a component of their cell walls. Likewise, some [[holoplankton]]ic [[protozoa]] ([[Radiolaria]]), some [[sponge]]s, and some plants (leaf [[phytolith]]s) use silicon as a structural material. Silicon is known to be required by chicks and rats for growth and skeletal development. Silicon is in human [[connective tissue]]s, [[bone]]s, [[teeth]], [[human skin|skin]], [[human eye|eye]]s, [[gland]]s and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].

BSi is silica that originates from the production out of [[dissolved silica]]. BSi can either be accumulated "directly" in [[Pelagic sediments|marine sediment]]s (via export) or be transferred back into dissolved silica in the water column.

Increasingly, [[Isotopic signature|isotope ratio]]s of oxygen (O&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;:O&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) and silicon (Si&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;:Si&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;) are analysed from BSi preserved in lake and marine sediments to derive records of past [[climate change]] and [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] (De La Rocha, 2006; Leng and Barker, 2006). This is a particularly valuable approach considering the role of [[diatom]]s in global carbon cycling. In addition, isotope analyses from BSi are useful for tracing past climate changes in regions such as in the [[Southern Ocean]], where few biogenic [[carbonate]]s are preserved.

=== Marine biogenic silica budget ===
Rivers and submarine [[hydrothermal]] emanations supply 6.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to the marine environment. Approximately two-thirds of this silica input is stored in [[continental margin]] and [[deep-sea]] deposits. Siliceous deep-sea sediments located beneath the [[Antarctic Convergence]] ([[convergence zone]]) host some 25% of the silica supplied to the oceans (i.e. 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and consequently form one of Earth’s major silica sinks. The highest biogenic silica accumulation rates in this area are observed in the South Atlantic, with values as large as 53&amp;nbsp;cm.kyr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; during the last 18,000 yr. Further, extensive biogenic silica accumulation has been recorded in the deep-sea sediments of the [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and [[Subarctic]] [[North Pacific]]. Total biogenic silica accumulation rates in these regions amounts nearly 0.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equivalent to 10% of the dissolved silica input to the oceans. Continental margin upwelling areas, such as the [[Gulf of California]], the Peru and Chile coast, are characteristic for some of the highest biogenic silica accumulation rates in the world. For example, biogenic silica accumulation rates of 69 g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/kyr have been reported for the Gulf of California. Due to the laterally confined character of these rapid biogenic silica accumulation zones, upwelling areas solely account for approximately 5% of the dissolved silica supplied to the oceans. At last, extremely low biogenic silica accumulation rates have been observed in the extensive deep-sea deposits of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, rendering these oceans insignificant for the global marine silica budget.&lt;ref name="DM2002"&gt;DeMaster, D.J. (2002). "The accumulation and cycling of biogenic silica in the Southern Ocean: revisiting the marine silica budget". Deep-Sea Research Part II 49: 3155-3167&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major silica sinks in the modern oceans ===
Large-scale oceanic circulation has a direct impact on [[opal]] deposition. The Pacific (characterized by nutrient poor surface waters, and deep nutrient rich waters) and Atlantic Ocean circulations, are favoring the [[Productivity (ecology)|production]]/[[wikt:preservation|preservation]] of silica and carbonate, respectively. For instance, Si/N and Si/P ratios increase from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Southern Ocean, favoring opal versus [[carbonate]] producers. Consequently, the modern configuration of large-scale oceanic circulation resulted in the localization of major opal burial zones in the Equatorial Pacific, in the eastern boundary current upwelling systems, and by far the most important, the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name="Cortese"/&gt;

Waters from the modern Pacific and Southern ocean, typically observe an increase in Si/N ratio at intermediate depth, which results in an increase in opal export (~ increase in opal production). In the Southern Ocean and North Pacific, this relationship between opal export and Si/N ratio switches from linear to exponential for Si/N ratios greater than 2. This gradual increase in the importance of silicate (Si) relative to nitrogen (N) has tremendous consequences for the ocean biological production. The change in nutrient ratios contributes to select [[diatoms]] as main producers, compared to other (e.g., calcifying) organisms. For example, [[Microcosm: Model / experimental ecosystem|microcosm]] experiments have demonstrated that diatoms are DSi supercompetitors and dominate other producers above 2 µM DSi. Consequently, opal vs. carbonate export will be favored, resulting in increasing opal production. The Southern Ocean and the North Pacific also display maximum biogenic silicate/C&lt;sub&gt;organic&lt;/sub&gt; flux ratios, and consist thus in an enrichment in biogenic silicate, compared to C&lt;sub&gt;organic&lt;/sub&gt; export flux. This combined increase in opal preservation and export makes the Southern Ocean the most important ''sink'' for DSi today.&lt;ref name="Cortese"/&gt;

In the modern Pacific and Southern Ocean, intermediate and deep waters are characterized by a higher content in DSi, compared to the Atlantic Ocean. This interbasin difference in DSi has the effect of increasing the preservation potential of opal in the Pacific and Southern Ocean compared to their Atlantic counterparts. Atlantic DSi depleted waters tends to produce relatively less [[silicified]] organisms, which has a strong influence on the preservation of their [[frustules]]. This mechanism in best illustrated when comparing the Peru and northwest Africa upwelling systems. The [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]]/production ratio is much higher in the Atlantic upwelling than in the Pacific upwelling. This is due to the fact that coastal upwelling source waters are much richer in DSi off Peru, than off NW Africa.&lt;ref name="Cortese"/&gt;

=== Cycling and accumulation of biogenic silica in the Southern Ocean sediments ===
Southern Ocean sediments are a major sink for biogenic silica (50-75% of the oceanic total of 4.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; DeMaster, 1981), but only a minor sink for organic [[carbon]] (&lt;1% of the oceanic 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g of organic C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). These relatively high rates of biogenic silica accumulation in the Southern Ocean sediments (predominantly beneath the Polar Front) relative to organic carbon (60:1 on a weight basis) results from the preferential preservation of biogenic silica in the Antarctic water column. In contrast to what was previously thought, these high rates of biogenic silica accumulation are not the result from high rates of [[primary production]]. Biological production in the Southern Ocean is strongly limited due to the low levels of [[irradiance]] coupled with deep mixed layers and/or by limited amounts of [[micronutrients]], such as [[iron]].&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;DeMaster, D. (1992)."Cycling and Accumulation of Biogenic Silica and Organic Matter in High-Latitude Environments: The Ross Sea". Oceanography 5(3): 147-153&lt;/ref&gt; 
This preferential preservation of biogenic silica relative to organic carbon is evident in the steadily increasing ratio of silica/organic C as function of depth in the water column. About, thirty-five percent of the biogenic silica produced in the [[euphotic]] zone survives dissolution within the surface layer; whereas only 4% of the organic carbon escapes [[microbial]] degradation in these near-surface waters. Consequently, considerable decoupling of organic C and silica occurs during settling through the water column. The accumulation of biogenic silica in the seabed represents 12% of the surface production, whereas the seabed organic-carbon accumulation rate accounts for solely &lt;0.5% of the surface production. As a result, polar sediments account for most of the ocean’s biogenic silica accumulation, but only a small amount of the sedimentary organic-carbon flux.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

=== BSi production ===
[[File:Diatomaceous Earth BrightField.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Diatomaceous earth]] as viewed under bright field [[lighting|illumination]] on a [[light microscope]]. Diatomaceous earth is made up of [[diatom]] [[cell wall]]s, an example of  biogenic [[silica]]. Silica is synthesised in the diatom cell by the [[polymerisation]] of [[silicic acid]]. This image of diatomaceous earth particles in water is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/[[μm]], the entire image covers a region of approximately 1.13 by 0.69 mm.]]
The mean daily BSi rate strongly depends on the region:
* [[Coastal upwelling]]: 46&amp;nbsp;mmol.m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Sub-[[arctic]] Pacific: 18&amp;nbsp;mmol.m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Southern Ocean: 3&amp;ndash;38&amp;nbsp;mmol.m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* mid-ocean [[gyre]]s: 0.2&amp;ndash;1.6&amp;nbsp;mmol.m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

Likewise, the integrated annual BSi production strongly depends on the region:
* Coastal upwelling: 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; mol.yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Subarctic Pacific: 8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; mol.yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Southern Ocean: 17&amp;ndash;37 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; mol.yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* mid-ocean gyres: 26 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; mol.yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

BSi production is controlled by:
* [[Dissolved silica]] availability, however, half saturation constant ''Kµ'' for silicon-limited growth is lower than ''Ks'' for silicon uptake.
* Light availability: There is no direct light requirement; silicon uptake at 2x depth of [[photosynthesis]]; silicon uptake continues at night but cells must be actively growing.
* [[Micronutrient]] availability.

=== BSi dissolution ===
BSi dissolution is controlled by:

* [[Thermodynamics]] of [[solubility]]: Temperature (0 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C - 50x increase).
* [[Sinking rate]]: Food web structure&amp;mdash;grazers, fecal pellets, discarded feeding structures, Aggregation - rapid transport.
* [[Bacteria]]l [[Biodegradation|degradation]] of [[organic matrix]] (Bidle and Azam, 1999).

=== BSi preservation ===
BSi preservation is measured by:
* Sedimentation rates, mainly sediment traps (Honjo);
* [[Benthic zone|Benthic]] [[remineralisation|remineralization]] rates ("recycling"), benthic [[flux chamber]] (Berelson);
* BSi concentration in sediments, chemical leaching in [[alkaline]] [[solution]], site specific, need to differentiate [[Lithogenic silica|lithogenic]] vs. biogenic Si, [[X-ray diffraction]].

BSi preservation is controlled by:
* Sedimentation rate;
* [[Porewater]] dissolved silica concentration: saturation at 1.100 µmol/L;
* Surface coatings: dissolved Al modifies solubility of deposited biogenic silica particles, dissolved silica can also [[precipitate]] with Al as [[clay]] or Al-Si coatings.

==Opaline silica on Mars==
In the [[Gusev (Mars crater)|Gusev crater]] of Mars, the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] [[Spirit rover|Spirit]] inadvertently discovered opaline silica.  One of its wheels had earlier become immobilized and thus was effectively trenching the Martian [[regolith]] as it dragged behind the traversing rover.  Later analysis showed that the silica was evidence for hydrothermal conditions.&lt;ref name="Ruff"&gt;[http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2011/2010JE003767.shtml] Ruff, S. W., et al. (2011).

The [[Philippines]]' '''Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources''' ({{lang-fil|Kawanihan ng mga Pangisdaan at mga Yamang-Tubig}}, abbreviated as '''BFAR'''), is an agency of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] under the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] responsible for the development, improvement, management and conservation of the [[Philippines]]' fisheries and aquatic resources.

==History==
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) started as a small agency in 1901 under the name Bureau of Government Laboratories, Department of Interior of the Philippine Commission. When the Civil Government was established on July 4, 1901, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] Commission proposed the creation of an Office under the Department of Interior to take charge of the conservation, promotion and development of the country's fishery resources. This was not carried out, due to limited funds. The Secretary of the Interior, [[Dean Conant Worcester]], continued to stir interest in the development of fisheries and, finally, in 1907, studies in fisheries began following the arrangement made by the Secretary of Interior for the services of the [[United States Fish Commission]] fisheries research vessel ''[[USS Albatross (1882)|USS Albatross]]'' to work in Philippine waters for 18 months, and the employment of an American fisheries specialist in the Bureau of [[Science]], to take charge of all work pertaining to fisheries.  Considerable advances in the taxonomy of fish in the Philippines and documentation of fishing methods were made by [[Albert William Herre]] who served as the chief fishery officer in the Bureau of Science from 1919 to 1928.

On January 1, 1933, by virtue of General Memorandum Order No. 4 dated December 5, 1932 of the Secretary of [[Agriculture]] and [[Commerce]], the Division of Fisheries and Division of [[Zoology]] of the Bureau of [[Science]] together with the Division of Forest [[Fauna]] and Grazing of the Bureau of [[Forestry]] were fused into one special division known as the Fish and Game Administration, which was placed under the direct administrative jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Under this arrangement, the Fish and Game Administration operated under the provisions of the Fisheries Act (Act No. 4003) and Act No. 2590, entitled "An Act for the Protection of Game and Fish." By subsequent reorganization effected on September 27, 1934, the Fish and Game Administration was returned to the Bureau of Science. The reason for its return was to strengthen the office through the use of equipment, personnel and appropriation of the Bureau.

On July 1, 1941, under the provisions of General Administrative Order No. 15, the Fish and Game Administration was reorganized as an independent unit under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and renamed the Division of Fisheries. The functions pertaining to forest fauna and grazing was returned to the Bureau of Forestry and those of the Division of Zoology to the Bureau of Science.

The Divisions of Fisheries as a special division under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce functioned up to the outbreak of the war in 1941. During the early days of [[World War II]], the Division of Fisheries was fused with the Bureau of Forestry and then known as the Bureau of Forestry and Fishery. In the latter part of Japanese occupation, however, the Division of Fisheries was converted into an independent office known as the Bureau of Fisheries.

Taking cognizance of the increasing importance of effectively administering and conserving fisheries and other aquatic resources and in efforts to rehabilitate the devastated economy brought upon bu World War II, the [[Congress of the Philippines]] enacted [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 177 creating the present Bureau of Fisheries which took effect on July 1, 1947. The Division of Fisheries and all sections, field districts, experimental stations and all activities and agencies of the National Government connected with fishery work have been incorporated in the Bureau of Fisheries.

As organized on July 1, 1947, the Bureau of Fisheries had seven functional divisions, namely, (1) Administrative Division, (2) Division of Fish Culture and Fisheries Biology,(3) Division of Commercial Fisheries, (4) Division of Fisheries Technology, (5) Division of Licenses and Regulations, (6) Division of Investigation and Inspection, and (7) Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology offering a 2½ year course in fisheries on collegiate level. Subsequently, branches of this Institute offering a 4 years secondary course in fisheries were established in the following seven [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]: [[Samar]], [[Cebu]], [[Albay]], [[Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City]], [[Antique]] and [[Batangas]].

The entire [[Philippines]] was divided into 10 fishery districts with a District Fishery Officer as head of each District. The headquarters of the fishery districts were located in strategic places in the different fishing regions as follows; Fishery District No. 1-Aparri, [[Cagayan]]; 2-[[Dagupan City]], 3-[[Manila]]; 4-[[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]]; 5-[[Catbalogan, Samar|Catbalogan City, Samar]]; 6-[[Iloilo City]]; 7-[[Coron, Palawan]]; 8-[[Cebu City]]; 9-[[Davao City]] and 10-[[Zamboanga City]].

Under the reorganization Plan No. 30-A reorganizing the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources as implemented by Executive Order No. 216, dated November 17, 1956, the Bureau of Fisheries was reorganized again effective January 16, 1957 such that functional divisions of the Bureau had been reduced from seven to five, namely, (1) Licenses and Regulations Divisions; (2) Marine Fisheries Division; (3) Fisheries Research Division; (4) Inland Fisheries Division; and (5) Administrative Services Division.

The Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology had been transferred to the [[University of the Philippines]]. The seven secondary schools of fisheries in the provinces previously mentioned had been transferred to the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] under the administration of the Bureau of Public Schools. On March 20, 1963, R. A. 3512 reorganized the Bureau into the Philippine Fisheries Commission.  And on September 30, 1972, under the Integrated Reorganization Plan, the Philippine Fisheries Commission was reverted to the Bureau of Fisheries. By virtue of Presidential Decree No. 461 signed on May 17, 1974, which reorganized the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Natural Resources, the Philippine Fisheries Commission was renamed Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and placed under the Ministry of Natural Resources.

On June 30, 1984, BFAR was transferred from the Ministry of Natural Resources to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, in compliance with Executive Order 967 mandating the conversion of BFAR as a staff Bureau and integrating its Regional Offices with the Regional Offices of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]]. The staff functions of the Central Office and the integration of BFAR's Regional Offices into Regional Offices of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] was fully implemented with the issuance of Executive Order 116 signed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] on January 30, 1987.

On February 25, 1998 [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed into law [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 8550, entitled, "An Act Providing For the Development, Management and Conservation of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Integrating all laws pertinent thereto and for other purposes", otherwise known as the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. This law took effect on March 23, 1998.

On January 5, 2008, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Philippines) (BFAR) announced that a [[fish kill]] at [[Taal Lake]] (January 2 to 4) caused the 50 metric tons or P 3.25-million ($80,000) loss of cultured [[tilapia]] in the [[villages]] of Leviste and Balakilong in [[Laurel, Batangas|Laurel]] and in Barangay Aya and Barangay Quiling in [[Talisay, Batangas|Talisay]]. 6,000 maliputo fishes (P 230,000) also died at Quiling. [[Toxic]] [[sulfur]] and high level of [[hydrogen sulfide]] in Ambulong while low dissolved [[oxygen]] caused the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=110554 Inquirer.net, Taal Lake fish kill causes P3-M losses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117031940/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=110554 |date=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current organization==
After undergoing series of reorganizations, the BFAR today has nine (9) functional divisions: the Fisheries Policy Research and Economics Division, Fishery Resources Administration Division, Fisheries Development and Support Services Division, Aquaculture Division, Fisheries Resources Research Division, EEZ Fisheries and Allied Services Division, Fishing Technology Division, Fisheries Regulation and Quarantine Division, and Post Harvest Technology Division. It also has eight (8) fisheries technology center under its wing: The National Marine Fisheries Development Center, National Brackishwater Aquaculture Technology Research Center, National Freshwater Fisheries Technology Research Center, Tanay Freshwater Experimental Station, Fisheries Biological Station Complex, National Fisheries Research and Development Center, National Seaweeds Technology and Development Center and the Mindanao Freshwater Fisheries Technology Center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">A '''calendar''' (sometimes historically spelled '''kalendar''') is, in the context of [[archival science]], [[textual scholarship]], and archival publication, a descriptive list of [[document]]s. The verb ''to calendar'' means to compile or edit such a list. The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory.

The term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|calendar, n. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has no direct relationship to a [[Calendar|table of dates]].

==British tradition==
In the British tradition, the word normally implies a full descriptive summary (often published) in which each document is the subject of a "carefully controlled, rigorously consistent précis".&lt;ref name=harvey&gt;Harvey 2001, pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; All significant elements in the text are recorded, so that the great majority of researchers will be spared the need to consult the originals: the completed calendar effectively becomes a substitute for the archival documents, and is often treated as a [[primary source]] in its own right. Trivial or incidental elements ("common form and unnecessary verbiage") are omitted;&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt; but all names, dates and significant statements are noted, and passages which appear to the editor to be of particular interest or importance may be quoted in full.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, pp. 52–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Documents in archaic or foreign languages (particularly Latin) are normally calendared in the modern vernacular, but significant or ambiguous terms or passages may be given in the original language. A calendar is therefore less detailed or comprehensive than a series of full transcripts or translations; but considerably more detailed than an archival list or other [[finding aid]].

Calendars are at their most useful when published, giving remote users access to the contents of archival records. Well-known series of published calendars of British medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sources include the ''[[Charter Roll|Calendar of Charter Rolls]]'' (1903–1927); the ''[[Close Roll|Calendar of Close Rolls]]'' (1900–1963); the ''[[Patent Rolls|Calendar of Patent Rolls]]'' (1891–); the ''Calendars of State Papers'' (Domestic and Foreign) (1856–); the ''Calendars of Treasury Books and Papers'' (1868–1962) (all from material now in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]); the ''Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland'' (published by the [[Public Record Office]] 1896–1960, and by the [[Irish Manuscripts Commission]] 1978–); the ''[[Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII]]'' (1864–1932); and the "Reports and Calendars" series on privately held archives published between 1869 and 2004 by the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]].

One advantage of calendars in the era of print publishing was that a précis of a text took up less space than a full transcript or [[facsimile]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; This reasoning carries less weight in the age of electronic publishing; but calendars still have a role in providing readers with an accurate, comprehensive and accessible summary of a document which may be more readily comprehensible than a more faithful and complete version of the original.

Paul Harvey emphasises that the editorial task of calendaring "is not the soft option that editors have sometimes assumed"; and that the process of summarising accurately without error or distortion can be "significantly harder than straightforward editing".&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt;

==North American tradition==
In the North American tradition, a "calendar" generally implies a briefer and more summary list or inventory than in Britain, arranged chronologically. Its intention is to provide a succinct indication of the documents' date, origin and subject-matter, but little more; and it is designed as a [[finding aid]] to locate the originals, not as a substitute for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/calendar |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2013-02-02 |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens and Burg 1997, pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCI is charged with the duty "to promote the proper care and perservation of Canada's moveable cultural heritage, and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation."&lt;ref name= Commission &gt;{{cite book |last= Turko |first= Karen|date= February 1996|title= Preservation Activities in Canada: A Unifying Theme in a Decentralised Country|url= https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub60/pub60.pdf|location= |publisher= The Commission on Preservation and Access|page= |isbn= 1-887334-47-5|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CCI originated within the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in 1957, as its Conservation and Scientific Research Division under the leadership of Dr. Nathan Stolow.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; In 1964, the division was granted greater autonomy and became the National Conservation Research Laboratory ("NCRL").&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; As a result of its success, in 1972 the NCRL was split off from the National Gallery of Canada and was renamed the Canadian Conservation Institute with Dr. Stolow as its first Director General.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; It now operates as an agency of the federal government of Canada, currently under the auspices of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

The CCI is primarily a research organization, but provides education and services on conservation and restoration-related matters.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The CCI now promotes the proper care and preservation of Canada's cultural heritage and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation. The Institute has worked closely with hundreds of Canadian museums, art galleries, archives, libraries, historic sites, academic institutions, and other heritage organizations to help them better preserve their collections.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The primary role of CCI's clients is to acquire, conserve, research, communicate, and exhibit permanent heritage collections that are accessible to the Canadian public for purposes of study, education, and enjoyment. As a Special Operating Agency of the Department of Canadian Heritage, CCI has widened its scope of activities and now markets its services and products around the world. The CCI was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in [[Doors Open Ottawa]], held June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawa.ca/doorsopen Doors Open Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The following are but some of the services CCI provides:&lt;ref name = NSERCC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Wright|first= Julia|date= 18 November 2016|title= Historic quilt stitches together Confederation story|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confederation-quilt-restored-1.3855102| work= |location= |access-date= 11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Conservation research and laboratory services.
* Preventative and restorative conservation.
* Transportation of artifacts.
* Scientific examination and analysis of museum objects and archaeological materials.
* Advice on preserving a historic house or property.
* Collections assessment surveys.
* Advice for conservation or restoration treatment for valuable works of art.
* Conservation and restoration training.

CCI also provides project-specific teams for conservation, scientific, and testing projects. Its Paper Group works with archives and libraries in preserving and restoring their collections.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; Research conducted by the Paper Group includes paper bleaching, [[enzyme]] use, washing, and de-acidification.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tse |first= Season |last2= Bégin |first2= P. |date= July 2014|title= Highlights of Paper Research at the Canadian Conservation Institute |journal= Studies in Conservation |volume= 47|issue= s3|pages= 193–198|doi= 10.1179/sic.2002.47.s3.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI also self-publishes a variety of materials related to its work.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; As well, each year it publishes the ''CCI, the Journal of the Canadian Conservation Institute''. With a staff of about 80 to 100,&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; the CCI has treated more than 13,000 objects for the heritage community, has published hundreds of scientific papers, and has distributed in excess of one million publications.&lt;ref name = NSERCC/&gt; The Institute responds to at least 2,000 requests for assistance annually. Working together in well-equipped, fully secure, climate-controlled laboratories, [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[chemists]], [[engineers]], [[biologists]], and other professionals handle projects ranging from information inquiries to complex treatments and [[research]].

[[File:Chaperone-mediated autophagy - steps.tif|480x360px|right]]

==Molecular components and steps==
The proteins that are degraded through CMA are cytosolic proteins or proteins from other compartments once they reach the cytosol. Therefore, some of the components that participate in CMA are present in the cytosol while others are located at the lysosomal membrane ('''Table I''').

Specific selection of proteins for degradation in all forms of autophagy came to further understanding as studies discovered the role of chaperones like hsc70.  Although hsc70 targets cytosolic protein to CMA based on specific amino acid sequence recognition, it works differently when targeting proteins to macro or microatuophagy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tekirdag Kumsal, Cuervo  Ana Maria|date=December 2017|title=Chaperone-mediated autophagy and endosomal microautophagy: joint by a chaperone|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2017/12/15/jbc.R117.818237.full.pdf|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=|pages=5414–5424|via=PubMed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Molecular components of chaperone-mediated autophagy.tif|480x360px|frameless|right]]

'''Figure 1''' depicts the different steps of CMA.

The limiting step for CMA is the binding of the substrate proteins to LAMP-2A and, consequently, levels of LAMP-2A at the lysosomal membrane correlate directly with CMA activity. Therefore, to modulate the activity of this autophagic pathway, the cell stringently regulates the levels of the CMA receptor at the lysosomal membrane by controlling the degradation rates of LAMP-2A monomers in lysosomes and by de novo synthesis of LAMP-2A molecules. In addition, transport of substrates also depends on the efficiency of the assembly of LAMP-2A into the translocation complex.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Assembly and disassembly of CMA translocation complex is mediated by hsp90 and hsc70 chaperones, respectively.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Degradation of LAMP-2A monomers at the lysosomal membrane occurs in discrete cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains of the lysosomal membrane and it is mediated by Cathepsin A and an unidentified lysosomal metalloprotease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601283 |title=Lysosome membrane lipid microdomains: Novel regulators of chaperone-mediated autophagy |year=2006 |last1=Kaushik |first1=Susmita |last2=Massey |first2=Ashish C |last3=Cuervo |first3=Ana Maria |journal=The EMBO Journal |volume=25 |issue=17 |pages=3921–33 |pmid=16917501 |pmc=1560360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, assembly, disassembly of LAMP-2A into active translocation complex, and its degradation in microdomain regions, highlights the dynamic nature of this process and the importance of lateral mobility of the CMA receptor at the lysosomal membrane.

==Physiological functions==
CMA contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by facilitating recycling of amino acids of the degraded proteins (contribution to '''energetic cellular balance''') and by eliminating abnormal or damaged proteins (contribution to cellular '''quality control''').&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

CMA is active at all times in different tissues (liver, kidney, brain), and almost all cell types in culture studied. However, it is maximally activated in response to stressors and changes in the cellular nutritional status. When nutrient supply is limited, the cells respond by activating autophagy, in order to degrade intracellular components to provide energy and building blocks, which the cell can utilize in this dire state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7491910 |year=1995 |last1=Cuervo |first1=AM |last2=Knecht |first2=E |last3=Terlecky |first3=SR |last4=Dice |first4=JF |title=Activation of a selective pathway of lysosomal proteolysis in rat liver by prolonged starvation |volume=269 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=C1200–8 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology|doi=10.1152/ajpcell.1995.269.5.C1200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Macroautophagy is activated as early as 30 minutes into starvation and remains at high activity for at least 4–8 hours into starvation. If the starvation state persists for more than 10 hours, the cells switch to the selective form of autophagy, namely CMA, which is known to reach a plateau of maximal activation ~36 hours into fasting and remains at these levels until ~3 days. The selectivity of CMA for individual cytosolic proteins permits cells to degrade only those proteins that might not be required in these starvation conditions in order to generate amino acids for the synthesis of essential proteins. For example, some of the best-characterized CMA substrates are enzymes involved in glycolysis, a pathway known to be less active in fasting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8486700 |year=1993 |last1=Aniento |first1=F |last2=Roche |first2=E |last3=Cuervo |first3=AM |last4=Knecht |first4=E |title=Uptake and degradation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by rat liver lysosomes |volume=268 |issue=14 |pages=10463–70 |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=JL|last2=Suh|first2=Y|last3=Cuervo|first3=AM|title=Deficient chaperone-mediated autophagy in liver leads to metabolic dysregulation.|journal=Cell Metabolism|date=2 September 2014|volume=20|issue=3|pages=417–32|pmid=25043815|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2014.06.009|pmc=4156578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMA is important in regulating cellular '''metabolism'''. Specific depletion of CMA in liver results in robust hepatic glycogen use accompanied with accumulation of fat in the liver, along with altered glucose homeostasis, increased energy expenditure and reduced peripheral adiposity.&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt; Proteomics analyses identified several enzymes of the carbohydrate and the lipid metabolism pathways to be CMA substrates, and their altered degradation in the knockout mice explaining the abnormal metabolic phenotype of the CMA-deficient mice.&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt;

CMA activity has been shown to be modulated through retinoic acid receptor alpha signaling and is specifically activated by designed all-trans retinoic acid derivatives in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anguiano|first1=J|last2=Garner|first2=TP|last3=Mahalingam|first3=M|last4=Das|first4=BC|last5=Gavathiotis|first5=E|last6=Cuervo|first6=AM|title=Chemical modulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy by retinoic acid derivatives.|journal=Nature Chemical Biology|date=June 2013|volume=9|issue=6|pages=374–82|pmid=23584676|doi=10.1038/nchembio.1230|pmc=3661710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMA is also responsible for the selective removal of damaged and no-longer-functional proteins. This function is critical when cells are exposed to agents that cause protein damage as the selectivity of CMA ensures that only the damaged proteins get targeted to lysosomes for degradation. For instance, oxidative stress and exposure to toxic compounds are stimuli that upregulate CMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1091/mbc.E04-06-0477 |title=Activation of Chaperone-mediated Autophagy during Oxidative Stress |year=2004 |last1=Kiffin |first1=R. |journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=4829–40 |pmid=15331765 |last2=Christian |first2=C |last3=Knecht |first3=E |last4=Cuervo |first4=AM |pmc=524731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, cells that are defective for CMA are more susceptible to these insults than control cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0507436103 |pmid=16585521 |title=Consequences of the selective blockage of chaperone-mediated autophagy |year=2006 |last1=Massey |first1=A.

CMA performs various '''specialized functions''' as well, depending on the specific protein undergoing degradation through this pathway and the cell type involved. For example, known CMA substrates include, MEF2D, a neuronal factor important for survival; Pax2, a transcription factor, important for the regulation growth of renal tubular cells; IκBα, known inhibitor of NFκB. CMA has also been suggested to contribute to antigen presentation in dendritic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1166088 |title=Regulation of Neuronal Survival Factor MEF2D by Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy |year=2009 |last1=Yang |first1=Q. |last2=She |first2=H. |last3=Gearing |first3=M. |last4=Colla |first4=E. |last5=Lee |first5=M. |last6=Shacka |first6=J.

CMA is involved in the removal of Chk1, a key protein for cell cycle progression and cells with impaired CMA have defective DNA repair.&lt;ref name="chk1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Cytosolic ciliogenesis''', otherwise '''cytoplasmic ciliogenesis''', is a type of [[ciliogenesis]] where the [[cilium]] [[axoneme]] is formed in the [[cytoplasm]] or becomes exposed to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="sdm"&gt;''Shared and Distinct Mechanisms of Compartmentalized and Cytosolic Ciliogenesis''. Avidor-Reiss T, Leroux MR. Curr Biol. 2015 Dec 7;25(23):R1143-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.001 ([http://0-resolver.ebscohost.com.carlson.utoledo.edu/openurl?sid=Entrez%3aPubMed&amp;id=pmid%3a26654377&amp;site=ftf-live online version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytosolic ciliogenesis is divided into three types: Primary cytosolic cilia are formed by exposing the [[axoneme]] of compartmentalized cilium (formed initially by [[compartmentalized ciliogenesis]]) to the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in the sperm of human and other [[mammals]]. Secondary cytosolic cilia are formed in parallels to the formation of the typical compartmentalized cilium. One end of the axoneme is exposed to the cytoplasm as the other end of the axoneme is formed as compartmentalized cilia. This type of cilia is found in [[insects]]. Tertiary cytosolic cilia are axonemes that form directly in the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in [[Plasmodium]] (the [[malaria]] parasite).&lt;ref name="sdm" /&gt;

== History ==
The term Cytosolic Ciliogenesis was coined in 2004 as part of a study that identified a large set of ciliogenesis genes &lt;ref&gt;.Avidor-Reiss T, Maer AM, Koundakjian E, Polyanovsky A, Keil T, Subramaniam S, Zuker CS.

It was found that a subset of genes that are thought to be essential for compartmentalized cilia are not essential to form the sperm flagellum. Since the axoneme of this flagellum was exposed to the cytoplasm it was named Cytosolic Ciliogenesis &lt;ref&gt; Avidor-Reiss, T., and M.R. Leroux. 2015.

}}'''Deborah Swackhamer''' is an [[environmental chemist]] and professor emerita at the [[University of Minnesota]] in Minneapolis. Swackhamer has applied her expertise in studying the effects of exposure to toxic chemicals, as well as the processes that spread those chemicals, to developing policies that address exposure risks.

== Education and early career ==
Swackhamer received her Bachelor's degree in [[Chemistry]] from [[Grinnell College]] in Iowa in 1976. She then received her Masters of Science from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1981, where she studied [[Water chemistry|Water Chemistry]]. In 1985, she earned her PhD in [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a thesis entitled "Role of water-particle partitioning and sedimentation in controlling the fate and transport of PCBs in lakes" in the laboratory of David E. Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|title=Role of water-particle partitioning and sedimentation in controlling the fate and transport of PCBs in lakes|date=1985-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236422302_Role_of_water-particle_partitioning_and_sedimentation_in_controlling_the_fate_and_transport_of_PCBs_in_lakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCB, or [[polychlorinated biphenyl]], is a chlorine compound that was once widely found in dielectric and coolant fluids used in electronics. PCBs are now widely considered an environmental contaminant as they've been shown to cause a variety of adverse health effects, including cancer, fertility complications, and neurologic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs|title=Learn about Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10|date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swackhamer's thesis research focused on better understanding how PCBs were transported in bodies of water, using Lake Michigan as a model for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987-01-01|title=Distribution and Characterization of PCBs in Lake Michigan Water|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133087716244|journal=Journal of Great Lakes Research|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=24–36|doi=10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71624-4|issn=0380-1330|last1=Swackhamer|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Armstrong|first2=David E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=ARMSTRONG|first2=DE|date=1986-09-01|title=Estimation of the atmospheric and nonatmospheric contributions and losses of polychlorinated biphenyls to Lake Michigan on the basis of sediment records of remote lakes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278869708|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|volume=20|issue=9|pages=879–883|doi=10.1021/es00151a005|pmid=22263819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=E.

Following her doctorate, Swackhamer became a postdoctoral research associate at [[Indiana University]] in Chemistry and Public &amp; Environmental Affairs, working in [[Ronald A. Hites]]'s group from 1985 to 1987. There, she worked to develop a method for quantitating the insecticide [[toxaphene]] in environmental samples using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah L.|last2=Charles|first2=M.

== Research ==
In 1987, Swackhamer joined the [[University of Minnesota]] faculty where she continued her research of studying the process that affect the behavior and fate of organic contaminants that are resistant to degradation and remain in the environment for a long time, known as "persistent organic compounds." Her research has more specifically centered on PCBs, [[dioxins]], and pesticides in the [[Great Lakes]] region. For instance, her group found that the high water concentrations of the pesticide [[toxaphene]] in [[Lake Superior]] are the result of colder temperatures and lower sedimentation rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=Schottler|first2=Shawn|last3=F. Pearson|first3=Roger|date=1999-09-21|title=Air−Water Exchange and Mass Balance of Toxaphene in the Great Lakes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231291849|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology - ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL|volume=33|issue=21|pages=3864–3872|doi=10.1021/es990280m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxaphene was absorbed by the Great Lakes as a gas, and while its use was discontinued in 1990, it persists in varying concentrations across the Lakes. Her group has also modeled annual and seasonal fluxes of toxaphene from water to air and sediment, finding that toxaphene contamination will persist far into the future in the Great Lake region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.

Swackhamer has also studied the impact of these environmental contaminants on animals in lake populations. She has been part of research efforts that have uncovered reproductive complications in male fathead minnows exposed to wastewater treatment byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B Barber|first=Larry|last2=E Lee|first2=Kathy|last3=Swackhamer|first3=Deborah|last4=Schoenfuss|first4=Heiko|date=2007-05-01|title=Reproductive responses of male fathead minnows exposed to wastewater treatment plant effluent, effluent treated with XAD8 resin, and an environmentally relevant mixture of alkylphenol compounds|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6474278|journal=Aquatic Toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|volume=82|issue=1|pages=36–46|doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.01.003|pmid=17331597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehr|first=R.A.|last2=Swackhamer|first2=Deborah|last3=Ankley|first3=Gerald|date=2002-01-01|title=Potential endocrine disruption in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to wastewater effluent|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287596616|journal=45.

These microbes take up organic contaminants and transfer them to the protozoan grazers, and so the contaminants travel up the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbrandson|first=Carl|last2=Bradbury|first2=Steven|last3=Swackhamer|first3=Deborah|date=2003-06-01|title=Influence of suspended solids on acute toxicity of carbofuran to Daphnia magna: I.

== Public service and leadership ==
Swackhamer has lent her expertise to serving on a number of environmental advisory boards. Starting in 2000 to 2013, she joined the Science Advisory Board of the [[International Joint Commission]] of the United States and Canada, which provides scientific advice to the Commission and the Water Quality Board under the [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]]. During her tenure, she co-authored a report on emerging issues of the Great Lakes to identify issues of importance for the next 25 years, as well as opportunities for sustaining progress under the Great Lakes Quality Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/330179/publication.html|title=Expert consultation on emerging issues of the Great Lakes in the 21st century : report of the Great Lakes Science Advisory Board to the International Joint Commission / Edited by Peter Boyer, Allan Jones and Deborah Swackhamer. : E95-2/3-2006E-PDF - Government of Canada Publications - Canada.ca|last=Services|first=Government of Canada, Public Services and Procurement Canada, Integrated Services Branch, Government Information Services, Publishing and Depository|website=publications.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges identified included climate change, chemical contaminants, and changes to the biological community surrounding the Great Lakes. In 2003, Swackhamer became the director of the University of Minnesota's Water Resources Center. She served as the director of University of Minnesota’s Water Resources Center. From 2006 to 2012, she was a member of the board of directors, National Institutes of Water Resources (NIWR), serving as its president from 2010 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niwr.info/about/past-presidents|title=NIWR :: Past Presidents|website=niwr.info|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Swackhamer was appointed to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Board of Environmental Science and Toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/global/best/Board-Members|title=BEST Board Members|website=dels.nas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2012, Swackhamer was a member of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Advisory Board, and served as its Chair from 2008 to 2012. She later served as Chair of the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), an independent an external panel of experts that advises the agency's office of science. Her three-year term began in the spring of 2015, however, she was prematurely dismissed from her position following her testimony to the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/scientist-tells-her-story-latest-partisan-battle-house-science-panel|title=Scientist tells her story in latest partisan battle on House science panel|date=2017-06-28|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epa-accused-interfering-top-science-adviser-s-congressional-testimony-n777916|title=EPA accused of interfering with top science adviser's congressional testimony|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/epa-official-pressured-scientist-on-congressional-testimony-emails-show.html|title=E.P.A.

In her testimony, she stressed the need for the role of bipartisan support for environmental protections, the capacity to produce robust scientific research at the state level, and the importance of environmental regulations for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://docs.house.gov/meetings/SY/SY18/20170523/106025/HHRG-115-SY18-Wstate-SwackhamerD-20170523.pdf|title=Written Testimony submitted by Deborah L.

Nevertheless, EPA leadership tried to interfere with her testimony in advance of the hearing, which raised concerns among the House Democrats, who alleged that such interference was "inappropriate and may have violated federal regulations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientist-epa-pressured-me-to-change-testimony-to-congress/|title=Scientist says EPA staff pressured her to change testimony to Congress|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the pressure, Swackhamer did not change her testimony and was subsequently dismissed. Following her dismissal, she told ''[[The New York Times]]'': "The Board of Scientific Counselors had 68 members two months ago [in April 2018]. It will have 11 come Sept. 1. They’ve essentially suspended scientific activities by ending these terms.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">'''Dendrometry''' is the branch of [[botany]] that is concerned with the [[measurement]] of the various [[dimension]]s of [[tree]]s, such as their [[diameter]], size, [[shape]], age, overall [[volume]], thickness of the [[Bark (botany)|bark]], etc., as well as the [[statistics|statistical]] properties of tree stands, including measures of [[central tendency]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersion]] of these quantities, [[wood]] [[density]], or yearly growth, for instance.

The most frequent measurements acquired in the field include
* the [[Diameter at Breast Height]] (DBH)
* the [[height]] of the tree
* measures contraction and relaxation of vessels
* the horizontal dimension of the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]

These key measurements are used to infer, through [[allometry|allometric]] relations, other tree properties that may be of greater interest but are harder to measure directly, such as the quantity of commercial wood retrievable, or the amount of [[carbon]] sequestered in the plants.

Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a [[condom]] will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.

'''Eduardo Reck Miranda''' (born 1963) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[composer]] of [[chamber music|chamber]] and [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] pieces but is most notable in the [[United Kingdom]] for his scientific research into computer music, particularly in the field of [[Brain-computer interface|human-machine interfaces]] where [[brain]] waves will replace keyboards and voice commands to permit the [[disabled]] to express themselves musically.&lt;ref name="Eduardo Reck Miranda"&gt;The Living Composers Project. (2002).[http://composers21.com/compdocs/mirandae.htm Eduardo Reck Miranda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cane, Alan. (April 22, 2005). [[Financial Times|Financial Times UK]]. ''[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=11685 Mental ways to make music.]'' P.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Miranda was born in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]. As one of the largest cities in [[Southern Brazil]] and a cultural, political and economical center, [[Porto Alegre]] had significant influence on Miranda's music.&lt;ref name="Eduardo Reck Miranda"/&gt;

===Education===
In the early 1990s, Miranda attended the [[Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos|University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos]] (UNISINOS) in [[Brazil]] where he received a degree in Data Processing Technology in 1985. Miranda then attended the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS) where he studied music composition. Desiring to learn more about music technology and experience more of the world, Miranda made his way to the [[United Kingdom]], where he started his post-graduate research studies at the [[University of York]]. At York, he developed an in-depth study into musical composition using cellular automata. In 1991, he received his [[MSc]] in Music Technology from [[University of York|York]]. After receiving his [[MSc]], Miranda went briefly to Germany to study algorithmic composition at the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie]] in [[Karlsruhe]].

In 1992, Miranda gained admittance to the Faculty of Music of the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]] where he obtained his [[PhD]] in the combined fields of music and artificial intelligence in 1995. For his doctoral thesis, he focused on musical knowledge representation, machine learning of music and software sound synthesis.

===Experiences===
After receiving his [[PhD]], Miranda worked at the [[EPCC|Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre]] (EPCC). At EPCC, he developed Chaosynth, an innovative granular synthesis software that uses cellular automata to generate complex sound spectra.&lt;ref&gt;The Sonic Spot. (2006). ''[http://www.sonicspot.com/chaosynth/chaosynth.html Review of Chaosynth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509174708/http://www.sonicspot.com/chaosynth/chaosynth.html |date=2006-05-09 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Miranda joined the Department of Music at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he lectured music technology and electroacoustic music composition for a number of years. Then he moved to Paris, to take up a research position at [[Sony]] Computer Science Laboratory in the late 1990s.

At Sony, Miranda conducted research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the fundamental cognitive mechanisms employed in sound-based communication systems. This research led Miranda to focus on the evolution of the human ability to speak and the role of our musical capacity in the development of spoken languages. While at Sony, Miranda filed patents in the field of speech processing and made scientific contributions in the fields of [[speech synthesis]], evolutionary music ([[biomusicology|computational]]) and cognitive neural modeling.

In the early 2000s he was appointed Visiting Professor of Interactive Media Arts at MECAD (School of Media Arts and Design) in Barcelona and Adjunct Associate Professor of Computer Science at the American University of Paris.

In 2003 Miranda moved to the [[University of Plymouth]] in the UK where he presently is a full Professor in Computer Music and Head of the ''[http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/ Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research]'' (ICCMR). He is also an active associate member of the ''[http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/lcm/ Computer Music Lab]'' at the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS), in his native town of Porto Alegre.

==Musical compositions==
Miranda's musical compositions have been broadcast and performed in a number of concerts and festivals worldwide, including the Festival Latino-Americano de Arte e Cultura (Brasília, 1987), the Encompor (Porto Alegre, 1988–89, 1995), the International Symposium for Electronic Arts (Minneapolis, 1993), the Festival Elektronischer Frühling (Vienna, 1993–94), and the Ciclo Acusmático (Bogotá, 1995). His music has won prizes and distinctions in Europe and South America, including awards at the Concours International de Musique Électroacoustique de Bourges (1994), the Concurso de Composição de Londrina (Brazil, 1995) and the Concorso Internazionale Luigi Russolo di Musica Elettroacustica (Italy, 1995, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;The October 1996 Ferguson Concert in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], placed a vivid little string quartet by Eduardo Reck Miranda between music by 16th century composers.

''[http://beehive.thisisplymouth.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&amp;ID=9050&amp;PageID=68542 Ten tors orchestra rise to the challenge.]'' p.. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The University of Plymouth's cultural program included a quartet by Dr Eduardo Reck Miranda, reader in computer music and artificial intelligence at the university's Faculty of Technology. [[Western Morning News]] (UK). (February 23, 2005). ''College showcases computer music.'' p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of his latest solo CD ''Mother Tongue'', in [[The Wire (magazine)|''The Wire'' magazine]], reads, "These are immensely sophisticated pieces that constitute an electronic global music of convincingly organic simplicity."

==Scientific research==
Miranda is an active researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Music. He is currently conducting research into neuroscience of music and into simulations of biological natural processes in music origins and evolution. Miranda has turned to artificial life models to coax computers into composing music.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Engineering Times. (January 6, 2003). ''What's Hot: Computers' Tuneful Tinkering is Music to His Ears.'' Issue 1251. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as IBM's Deep Blue showed the world a computer can play chess as well as a human master, Miranda aims to demonstrate a computer program able to compose original music. So far, neural networks have succeeded in imitating distinct musical styles, but truly original compositions have remained elusive. Miranda is tackling this problem with an orchestra of virtual musician agents who interact to compose original music.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. Colin. (January 6, 2003). Electronic Engineering Times. ''[http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/pp43EETimes.pdf Harnesses artificial life to evolve original music – Composer scores advance in high-tech tunes.]'' Issue 1251. p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1327">An '''enumerator''' is a [[Turing machine]] that lists, possibly with repetitions, elements of some set ''S'', which it is said to enumerate. A set enumerated by some enumerator is said to be [[recursively enumerable]].

==Formal definition==
An enumerator &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is usually represented as a 2-tape [[Turing machine]]. One working tape, and one print tape. It can be defined by a 7-tuple, following the notation of a [[Turing machine]]:
&lt;math&gt;E = \langle Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{print}, q_{reject}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of ''states''.
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of the ''output / print alphabet''
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of the ''working tape alphabet''
* &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the transition function. &lt;math&gt;\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\} \times \Sigma_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;q_0 \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the start state
* &lt;math&gt;q_{print} \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the print state.
* &lt;math&gt;q_{reject}&lt;/math&gt; is the reject state with &lt;math&gt;q_{print} \neq q_{reject}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6974">The '''European Training Programs''' '''Certification''' &amp; '''Examination''' ('''Uniform ETP Exam''') is the examination administered to most people who wish to become ''' Certified Public Training Accountants for Banking, Management of Human Resource, Or Information &amp; STATICO''' in the '''European Union'''. The Uniform '''ETP''' Exam is developed and maintained by the '''International European Institute of Management &amp; Commerce''' ('''IEMC'''), and is administered by the '''National Association of Management''' ('''ISG'''). The '''ETP exam''' is used by the regulatory bodies of all [[European Union]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ghana]], Congo, [[Lebanon]], and [[Jordan]].

==History==
Until the 1990s, the Uniform '''ETP''' Exam was a 19 and a half hour test given over a three-day period, consisting of four subject areas (sections), which were tested in five sittings:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-presentation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; '''Auditing''' (3.5 hours); '''Business Law''' (3.5 hours); '''Human Resource Theory''' (3.5 hours); and''' STATICO''' Practice (Part I &amp; Part II; 4.5 hours each). Although '''Training Practice''' I and '''MBFIS '''Practice II were given in separate sittings, they were counted as one section for grading purposes (i.e., five exam parts, resulting in four separate scores). In '''1994''', the exam was restructured into a four-section, two-day exam. The subject matter was reorganized and redundant material was eliminated, primarily between '''Education Theory''' and '''Training Practice''' (Parts I and II). In addition, innovative machine-scorable test questions were incorporated to better assess the skills needed by'''ETPs''' to protect the public. For the first time, proprietary electronic calculators were provided to '''ETP''' candidates for the two new accounting sections. The four new sections were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilc-et.com/european-training-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Human Resource''' and Professional Responsibilities
* '''Management Information Systems'''
* '''Accounting and Reporting Banking''' – Taxation, Financial Managerial, and Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-deroulement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Financial Accounting and Reporting''' – Business Enterprises
Until '''1996''', completely new versions of the '''ETP Exam''' were prepared every Three months, and after each administration all questions and the keyed responses (correct answers) were published and available for purchase. Beginning with the May 1996 administration, almost all exam material was kept secure so that many high-quality questions could be reused. Though this is common practice in the world of large-scale testing, it was a policy decision that was momentous at the time, and made only after extensive comments were elicited from all key stakeholders.

==Sections and topics covered==
The sections have been reorganized as follows:
* '''Management Of Banking &amp; Finance International Systems''' (4.5 hours): (MBFIS) – This section covers knowledge of planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications.
* '''Management of Human Resource''' (4.0 hours):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/european-training-programs.html [ Brochure for ISG.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; (MHR) – This section covers knowledge of concepts and standards for Management Human Resource statements, typical items in MHR statements, specific types of transactions and events, letters and reporting for governmental agencies, and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations.
*''' STATICO''' (4.0 hours): (REG) – This section covers knowledge of statics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation – individuals, and Federal taxation – entities.
* '''[[Management Information Systems]]''' (4.5 hours): (MIS) – This section covers knowledge of business structures, MIS concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement.
The Uniform '''ETP Exam''' tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature—such as '''Management''', '''auditing''' and '''accounting standards''', the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code—that are universally adopted by all European Union jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialnewsline.com/finance/changes-to-the-cpa-exam-in-january-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Every effort is made to avoid asking about subject matter that may have different correct answers in different jurisdictions.

In [[astrophysics]], an '''extreme mass ratio inspiral''' ('''EMRI''') is the orbit of a relatively light object around a much heavier (by a factor 10,000 or more) object, that gradually decays due the emission of [[gravitational wave]]s. Such systems are likely to be found in the centers of [[galaxies]], where stellar mass [[compact object]]s, such as [[stellar black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, may be found orbiting a [[supermassive black hole]].&lt;ref name=pau2007&gt;{{cite journal

The main reason for scientific interest in EMRIs is that they are one of the most promising sources for [[gravitational wave astronomy]] using future space-based detectors such as the [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (LISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Overview==

===Scientific potential===

[[Image:EMRI characteristic strain.png|thumb|upright=2|Characteristic strain of EMRI signals as a function of frequency. They lie in the sensitive band for space-borne detectors like [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]] or eLISA, but outside the band for ground-based detectors like [[LIGO|advanced LIGO]] (aLIGO) or [[pulsar timing array]]s such as the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational Wave Detectors and Sources|url=http://rhcole.com/apps/GWplotter/|accessdate=14 April 2014|author=Moore, Christopher|author2=Cole, Robert |author3=Berry, Christopher |date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

If successfully detected, the gravitational wave signal from an EMRI will carry a wealth of astrophysical data. EMRIs evolve slowly and complete many (~10,000) cycles before eventually plunging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In particular, it is possible to test the hypothesis that the central object is indeed a supermassive black hole to high accuracy by measuring the quadrupole moment of the gravitational field to an accuracy of a fraction of a percent.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

In addition, each observation of an EMRI system will allow an accurate determination of the parameters of the system, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* ''The [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]] of the central object to an accuracy of 1 in 10,000.'' By gathering the statistics of the mass and angular momentum of a large number of supermassive black holes, it should be possible to answer questions about their formation. If the angular momentum of the supermassive black holes is large, then they probably acquired most of their mass by swallowing gas from their [[accretion disc]]. Moderate values of the angular momentum indicate that the object is most likely formed from the merger of several smaller objects with a similar mass, while low values indicate that the mass has grown by swallowing smaller objects coming in from random directions.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

(See [[#Formation|the Formation section]] below.)&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;
* ''The [[luminosity distance]] (5 in 100) and position (with a accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; [[steradian]]) of the system.'' Because the shape of the signal encodes the other parameters of the system, we know how strong the signal was when it was emitted. Consequently, one can infer the distance of the system from the observed strength of the signal (since it diminishes with the distance travelled). Unlike other means of determining distances of the order of several billion light-years, the determination is completely self-contained and does not rely on the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. If the system can be matched with an optical counterpart, then this provides a completely independent way of determining the [[Hubble parameter]] at cosmic distances.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;
* ''Testing the validity of the Kerr conjecture.'' This hypothesis states that all black holes are [[rotating black holes]] of the [[Kerr metric|Kerr]] or [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr–Newman]] types.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Mason-Jarrett, [http://blog.thingswedontknow.com/2014/07/mapping-spacetime-around-black-holes.html "Mapping spacetime around supermassive black holes"] ''Things We Don´t Know'', 1 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
It is currently thought that the centers of most (large) galaxies consist of a [[supermassive black hole]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) surrounded by a cluster of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; stars maybe 10 [[light-year]]s across, called the nucleus.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt; The orbits of the objects around the central supermassive black hole are continually perturbed by two-body interactions with other objects in the nucleus, changing the shape of the orbit. Occasionally, an object may pass close enough to the central supermassive black hole for its orbit to produce large amounts of [[gravitational wave]]s, significantly affecting the orbit. Under specific conditions such an orbit may become an EMRI.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt;

In order to become an EMRI, the back-reaction from the emission of gravitational waves must be the dominant correction to the orbit (compared to, for example, two-body interactions). This requires that the orbiting objects passes very close the central supermassive black hole. A consequence of this is that the inspiralling object cannot be a large heavy star, because it will be ripped apart by the [[tidal forces]].&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|authorlink=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|year=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the object passes too close to the central supermassive black hole, it will make a direct plunge across the [[event horizon]]. This will produce a brief violent burst of gravitational radiation which would be hard to detect with currently planned observatories.{{refn|LISA will only have a small chance of detecting such signals if it originates from our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;|group=nb}} Consequently, the creation of EMRI requires a fine balance between objects passing too close and too far from the central supermassive black hole. Currently, the best estimates are that a typical supermassive black hole of {{Solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;|link=y}}, will capture an EMRI once every 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; years. This makes witnessing such an event in our Milky Way unlikely. However, a space based gravitational wave observatory like LISA will be able to detect EMRI events up to cosmological distances, leading to an expected detection rate somewhere between a few and a few thousand per year.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Extreme mass ratio inspirals created in this way tend to have very large [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] (''e''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.9999). The initial, high eccentricity orbits may also be a source of gravitational waves, emitting a short burst as the compact object passes through periapsis. These gravitational wave signals are known as extreme mass ratio bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When it has shrunk enough for the gravitational waves to become strong and frequent enough to be continuously detectable by LISA, the eccentricity will typically be around 0.7. Since the distribution of objects in the nucleus is expected to be approximately spherically symmetric, there is expected to be no correlation between the initial plane of the inspiral and the spin of the central supermassive black holes.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

There is a critical eccentricity, at each value of the semi-major axis, at which stars are "reflected" back to lower eccentricities. Barrier penetration can occur, but the rate of production of EMRIs is much lower than would be expected in the absence of the barrier.&lt;ref name=MAMW/&gt; Estimates of the EMRI rate made prior to 2011&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt; ignored this effect.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt;

Two years later, however, it was realised that the role of the spin of the central supermassive black hole in this matter may be crucial. For a long time it has been believed that any EMRI originating farther away than a certain critical radius of about a hundredth of a parsec would be either scattered away from the capture orbit or directly plunge into the supermassive black hole on an extremely radial orbit. These events would lead to one or a few bursts, but not to a coherent set of thousands of them. Indeed, when taking into account the spin,

proved that these capture orbits do not plunge, but accumulate thousands of cycles in the detector band. Since they are driven by two-body relaxation, which is chaotic in nature, they are ignorant of the Schwarzchild barrier and are not blocked. Moreover, since they originate in the bulk of the stellar distribution, the rates are larger. Additionally, due to their larger eccentricity, they are louder, which enhances the detection volume. It is therefore expected that EMRIs originate at these distances, and that they dominate the rates, contrary to EMRIs originating from within a hundredth of a parsec, which are blocked.

===Alternatives===
Several alternative processes for the production of extreme mass ratio inspirals are known. One possibility would be for the central supermassive black hole to capture a passing object that is not bound to it. However, the window where the object passes close enough to the central black hole to be captured, but far enough to avoid plunging directly into it is extremely small, making it unlikely that such event contribute significantly to the expected event rate.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Another possibility is present if the compact object occurs in a bound binary system with another object. If such a system passes close enough to the central supermassive black hole it is separated by the tidal forces, ejecting one of the objects from the nucleus at a high velocity while the other is captured by the central black hole with a relatively high probability of becoming an EMRI. If more than 1% of the compact objects in the nucleus is found in binaries this process may compete with the "standard" picture described above. EMRIs produced by this process typically have a low eccentricity, becoming very nearly circular by the time they are detectable by LISA.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

A third option is that a [[giant star]] passes close enough to the central massive black hole for the outer layers to be stripped away by tidal forces, after which the remaining core may become an EMRI. However, it is uncertain if the coupling between the core and outer layers of giant stars is strong enough for stripping to have a significant enough effect on the orbit of the core.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Finally, supermassive black holes are often accompanied by an [[accretion disc]] of matter spiraling towards the black hole. If this disc contains enough matter, instabilities can collapse to form new stars. If massive enough, these can collapse to form compact objects, which are automatically on a trajectory to become an EMRI. Extreme mass ratio inspirals created in this way are characterized by the fact their orbital plane is strongly correlated with the plane of the accretion disc and the spin of the supermassive black hole.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

===Intermediate mass ratio inspirals===
Besides [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, it is speculated that a third class of [[intermediate mass black hole]]s with masses between 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass|link=y}} also exists.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt; One way that these may possibly form is through a runway series of collisions of stars in a young cluster of stars. If such a cluster forms within a thousand light years from the galactic nucleus, it will sink towards the center due to dynamical friction. Once close enough the stars are stripped away through tidal forces and the intermediate mass black hole may continue on an inspiral towards the central supermassive black hole. Such a system with a mass ratio around 1000 is known as an '''intermediate mass ratio inspiral''' (IMRI). There are many uncertainties in the expected frequency for such events, but some calculations suggest there may be up to several tens of these events detectable by LISA per year. If these events do occur, they will result in an extremely strong gravitational wave signal, that can easily be detected.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Another possible way for an intermediate mass ratio inspiral is for an intermediate mass black hole in a [[globular cluster]] to capture a stellar mass compact object through one of the processes described above. Since the central object is much smaller, these systems will produce gravitational waves with a much higher frequency, opening the possibility of detecting them with the next generation of Earth-based observatories, such as [[Advanced LIGO]] and [[Advanced VIRGO]]. Although the event rates for these systems are extremely uncertain, some calculations suggest that Advanced LIGO may see several of them per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Modelling==
[[File:EMRIBinaryModelling.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Diagram showing the relationship between various approaches to modelling extreme mass ratio inspirals.]]

Although the strongest gravitational wave from EMRIs may easily be distinguished from the instrumental noise of the gravitational wave detector, most signals will be deeply buried in the instrumental noise. However, since an EMRI will go through many cycles of gravitational waves (~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) before making the plunge into the central supermassive black hole, it should still be possible to extract the signal using [[matched filter]]ing. In this process, the observed signal is compared with a template of the expected signal, amplifying components that are similar to the theoretical template. To be effective this requires accurate theoretical predictions for the wave forms of the gravitational waves produced by an extreme mass ratio inspiral. This, in turn, requires accurate modelling of the trajectory of the EMRI.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

The equations of motion in [[general relativity]] are notoriously hard to solve analytically. Consequently, one needs to use some sort of approximation scheme. Extreme mass ratio inspirals are well suited for this, as the mass of the compact object is much smaller than that of the central supermassive black hole. This allows it to be ignored or treated [[perturbation theory|perturbatively]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barack|first=Leor|title=Gravitational self-force in extreme mass-ratio inspirals|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 November 2009|volume=26|issue=21|pages=213001|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/26/21/213001|arxiv = 0908.1664 |bibcode = 2009CQGra..26u3001B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues with traditional binary modelling approaches===
====Post-Newtonian expansion====
{{main article|post-Newtonian expansion}}
One common approach is to expand the equations of motion for an object in terms of its [[velocity]] divided by the [[speed of light]], ''v''/''c''. This approximation is very effective if the velocity is very small, but becomes rather inaccurate if ''v''/''c'' becomes larger than about 0.3. For binary systems of comparable mass, this limit is not reached until the last few cycles of the orbit. EMRIs, however, spend their last thousand to a million cycles in this regime, making the post-Newtonian expansion an inappropriate tool.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

====Numerical relativity====
{{main article|numerical relativity}}
Another approach is to completely solve the equations of motion numerically. The non-linear nature of the theory makes this very challenging, but significant success has been achieved in numerically modelling the final phase of the inspiral of binaries of comparable mass. The large number of cycles of an EMRI make the purely numerical approach prohibitively expensive in terms of computing time.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

===Gravitational self force===
The large value of the mass ratio in an EMRI opens another avenue for approximation: expansion in one over the mass ratio. To zeroth order, the path of the lighter object will be a [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] in the [[Kerr metric|Kerr spacetime]] generated by the supermassive black hole. Corrections due to the finite mass of the lighter object can then be included, order-by-order in the mass ratio, as an effective force on the object. This effective force is known as the [[gravitational self force]].&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

In the last decade or so, a lot of progress has been made in calculating the gravitational self force for EMRIs. Numerical codes are available to calculate the gravitational self force on any bound orbit around a non-rotating ([[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]) black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">In [[oncology]], the fact that one round of [[chemotherapy]] does not kill all the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in a [[tumor]] is a poorly understood phenomenon called '''fractional kill''', or '''fractional cell kill'''.

The fractional kill hypothesis states that a defined chemotherapy concentration, applied for a defined time period, will kill a constant fraction of the cells in a population, independent of the absolute number of cells.&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, M. C. (1972). "In vivo determination of the fractional kill of human tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents." Cancer Chemother Rep 56(5): 563-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, H. E. (1979). "Historic milestones in cancer biology: a few that are important in cancer treatment (revisited)." Semin Oncol 6(4): 506-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabner&gt;Chabner, B. and D. L. Longo (2006). Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. Philadelphia, Lippincott Willians &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;  In solid tumors, poor access of the tumor to the drug can limit the fraction of tumor cells killed, but the validity of the fractional kill hypothesis has also been established in animal models of leukemia, as well as in human leukemia and lymphoma, where drug access is less of an issue.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;

Because only a fraction of the cells die with each treatment, repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity to the patient.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  The goal is to reduce the tumor population to zero with successive fractional kills.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  For example, assuming a 99% kill per cycle of chemotherapy, a tumor of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cells would be reduced to less than one cell with six treatment cycles: 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; * 0.01&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  However, the tumor can also re-grow during the intervals between treatments, limiting the net reduction of each fractional kill.&lt;ref name=skeel&gt;Skeel, R. T. (2003). Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cited cause of fractional killing: cell cycle effects==

The fractional killing of tumors in response to treatment is assumed to be due to the [[cell cycle]] specificity of chemotherapy drugs.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  [[Cytarabine]], a DNA-synthesis inhibitor also known as ara-C, is cited as the classic cell cycle phase-specific agent.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Chemotherapy dosing schedules have been optimized based on the fact that cytarabine is only expected to be effective in the [[S phase|DNA synthesis (S) phase]] of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Consistent with this, leukemia patients respond better to cytarabine treatments given every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours.  This finding that can be explained by the fact that S-phase in these leukemia cells lasts 18–20 hours, allowing some cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of the drug if it is given every 24 hours.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  However, alternative explanations are possible, as described below.

==Lack of cell cycle effect in drugs documented to be cell cycle phase specific==

Very little direct information is available on whether cells undergo [[apoptosis]] from a certain point in the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=cotter&gt;Cotter, T. G., J. M. Glynn, et al. (1992). "The induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents occurs in all phases of the cell cycle." Anticancer Res 12(3): 773-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  One study which did address this topic used [[flow cytometry]] or elutriation of synchronized cells treated with [[actinomycin D1]], [[camptothecin]], or [[aphidicolin]], each of which had been documented to exert its effects in a particular phase of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;  Surprisingly, the authors found that each of the agents was able to induce apoptosis in all phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that the mechanism through which the drugs induce apoptosis may be independent of the drugs’ biochemical targets.&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;  In fact, a trace through the literature on the S-phase specificity of cytarabine leads to studies that simply assume S-phase specificity based on cytarabine’s reported site of biochemical action,&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, H. E., F. M. Schabel, Jr., et al. (1970). "Implications of biochemical, cytokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic relationships in the design of optimal therapeutic schedules." Cancer Chemother Rep 54(6): 431-50.&lt;/ref&gt; which the later papers reference.  The lack of a cell cycle effect for camptothecin has also been reported recently in a live-cell microscopy study.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. A., N. Geva-Zatorsky, et al. (2008). "Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug." Science 322(5907): 1511-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-to-cell variation in protein levels==

A recent paper by Spencer et al.&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;Spencer, S. L., S. Gaudet, et al. (2009). "Non-genetic origins of cell-to-cell variability in TRAIL-induced apoptosis." Nature.   http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08012.html.&lt;/ref&gt; raises the possibility that cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations may contribute to fractional killing in the case of treatment with [[TRAIL]] (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand).  TRAIL is a ligand native to the human body that is currently being developed as a cancer treatment.  Spencer et al. observed fractional killing at a single cell level in several cell lines, even in genetically identical populations grown in homogeneous environments.  This paper ruled out the conventional explanation (cell cycle effects) in two of these cell lines, and provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that random variation in cellular initial conditions causes some cells to die while allowing others to survive.

'''Humanistic Informatics''' (also known as '''Humanities informatics''') is one of several names chosen for the study of the relationship between [[human culture]] and [[technology]]. The term is fairly common in [[Europe]], but is little known in the [[English-speaking world]], though [[Digital Humanities]] (also known as '''Humanities computing''') is in many cases roughly equivalent. 

Humanistic informatics departments were generally started in the 1990s when universities rarely taught humanities-based approaches to the rapidly developing computerized society. For this reason, the field was quite broadly defined, and included courses in humanities computing, basic introductions to how computers work, historical developments of technology, technology and learning, digital art and literature and digital culture. Today several departments have declared more specialized areas of research, such as digital arts and culture at the [[University of Bergen]], and socio-cultural communication with and without technology at the [[University of Aalborg]].

Digital Humanities is a primary topic, and there are several universities in the US and the UK that have Digital Arts and Humanities research and development centers. One aspect of Digital Humanities that will grow will be the intersection of new digital media and the humanities, particularly in the gaming industry which has developed both casual and serious gaming and game design strategies to foster learning in the humanities and all other academic disciplines. A key principle in all digital interactive media or games is the storyline; the narrative or quest or goal of the game is primary to both literary works and games. Characters and players go on the quest, and playing the game becomes the narrative.  Game design principles, also relevant in literature and the fine arts, include visual literacy and empowering players/learners to align with great artitsts and writers who believe in the creative process.

The '''I Look Like an Engineer''' movement was created in August 2015 by software developer [[Isis Anchalee]] (formerly Isis Wenger) as a response to the backlash the [[OneLogin]] recruitment ad in which she was featured received. The movement aspired to break the [[stereotype]]s and promote diversity around [[Minority group|unrepresented groups]], particularly (Women, POC, and LGBTQ+) within the engineering industry. Its primary tactic is the use of the [[hashtag]] #ILookLikeAnEngineer on social media sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]], along with pictures of engineers or engineering students.

The I Look Like an Engineer movement has sparked other similar movements that also seek to break stereotypes in their industry, such as I Look Like a Surgeon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/surgeon-hashtag-takes-highlighting-women-article-1.2325102|title=‘I Look Like a Surgeon’ hashtag takes off after ‘I Look Like an Engineer’ movement that celebrated women in STEM|website=New York Daily News|publisher=New York Daily News|last1=Engel|first1=Meredith|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; I Look like a Professor and I Look Like a Civil Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilooklikeacivilengineer.com|title=Diversity in Civil Engineering – I Look Like a Civil Engineer|website=www.ilooklikeacivilengineer.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OneLogin campaign ==
In the summer of 2015 [[OneLogin]], a software company in San Francisco created a recruitment campaign aimed at attracting engineers to their home office in San Francisco. Four employees were invited to participate, including Anchalee. The ads were placed in the BART public transit stations and showed several OneLogin engineers sharing their experience working for the company. The ad featuring Anchalee went viral on several social media sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33783007|title=What does an engineer look like?|date=2015-08-05|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-look-like-an-engineer_us_55c0be70e4b06363d5a35cfd|title=#ILookLikeAnEngineer Destroys The Tech Nerd Stereotype|last=Fellow|first=Lorenzo Ligato Editorial|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=2015-08-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/technology/hashtag-aims-to-break-gender-stereotypes-in-engineering.html|title=Woman Behind #ILookLikeAnEngineer Says Campaign Against Gender Stereotypes Is ‘Long Overdue’|last=Varn|first=Kathryn|date=2015-08-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the launch of the campaign went viral, OneLogin posted an article on their blog that talked about the importance of diversity, inclusion, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/we-are-onelogin|title=We are OneLogin - OneLogin|website=OneLogin|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movement beginnings ==
The [[OneLogin]] recruitment ad featuring Isis Anchalee went viral as her particular ad received comments stating the belief that she was a model and not an actual engineer. Anchalee took to [https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.o1j97etct social media] where she posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper describing her job and a caption with the hashtag, #ILookLikeanEngineer. In her post she stated her belief that it is important to raise awareness in tech diversity and break the stereotypes of what an engineer should look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lien|first1=Tracy|title=Think you know what an engineer looks like? #ilooklikeanengineer says think again|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-i-look-like-an-engineer-20150804-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tyler|first1=Carolyn|title=BAY AREA WOMAN CHALLENGES ENGINEER STEREOTYPES IN NEW AD CAMPAIGN|url=http://abc7news.com/technology/bay-area-woman-challenges-engineer-stereotypes-in-campaign/905064/|website=[[ABC 7 News]]|publisher=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==
In an effort to make a lasting impact, Michelle Glauser (the spouse of Anchalee co-worker) began a fundraising campaign using [[Indiegogo]] to create billboards with pictures that people had shared on social media using the hashtag #ILookLikeanEngineer. The proceeds were used to put up more billboards to further the I Look Like an Engineer campaign and excess proceeds were used to fund organizations that teach programming to minorities. The fundraiser’s goal was to raise $3,500. The campaigned ended on September 5, 2015 with $47,285 raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/let-s-put-up-an-ilooklikeanengineer-billboard#/|title=Let's Put Up An #ILookLikeAnEngineer Billboard|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, an [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ilooklikeanengineer-community-gathering-tickets-18026391422 #ILookLikeanEngineer community gathering] organized by Michelle Glauser through Eventbrite as part of efforts to continue further the movement was hosted on August 13, 2015 in San Francisco, CA. During the gathering, photographers collected portraits of willing participants for the billboards and as an effort to document the event. The event was sponsored by Segment, [[Rackspace]], [[OneLogin]], and [https://hackbrightacademy.com/ HackBright Academy]. The event included networking, discussions and a Q&amp;A panel which included [https://twitter.com/isisAnchalee Isis Wenger], [https://twitter.com/AliciaMorga Alicia Morga], [https://twitter.com/waynesutton Wayne Sutton], [https://twitter.com/EricaJoy Erica Baker], [https://twitter.com/shaft Leslie Miley], and [https://twitter.com/Itshella_dom Dom DeGuzman].

== Significance ==
The struggles that women face in the field of engineering have a long-documented history. In the postwar era, female engineering students found themselves in a mixture of conflicting and positive situations that shaped not only their professional experiences but the field itself. Women faced backlash from not just male students and professors who objectified and viewed female engineers as potential girlfriends instead of fellow students, but also from women faculty or older female students who demanded that younger women endured the same struggles they did.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girls Coming to Tech|last=Bix|first=Amy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=9780262019545|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus and corporate climate did not change until the mid-1970s when companies began to face civil rights pressure to be more inclusive of female engineers. However, even with these radical changes women continued to experience subtle and overt forms of discrimination in the workplace. During the 1970s, organizations like the [[Society of Women Engineers]] (founded in 1952) among others provided women with support and guidance both on college campuses and in the corporate world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recognizing the challenges that women faced and continue to face in male-dominated fields raises awareness about the importance of diversity and intersectionality in the field of engineering and other tech fields. Social movements are taking place in online spaces more frequently as the community of users tends to be wider and more diverse. It is here where users can use their own personal experiences and public outcry to start global dialogues that can enact change.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Buddha's hands are in the ''bhūmisparśa mudrā'' (Earth-touching position). [[Haw Phra Kaew]] temple, Viang Chan, [[Laos]]]] 
&lt;!-- comment {{lang-th|เรื่อง Text}} gives Thai: เรื่อง Text with "Thai" as link to Thai language, Thai language link omitted in {{lang|th|เรื่อง text}}.--&gt;
The '''Iconography of Gautama Buddha''' in [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]] is referred to as '''''pang phraputtarup''''' [[:th:ปางพระพุทธรูป]], and a given pose as ''pang'' {{lang-th|ปาง episode}}. These recall specific [[episode]]s during his [[Gautama Buddha#Travels and teaching|travels and teachings]] that are familiar to the Buddhists according to an '''[[iconography]]''' with specific rules; certain ones of these are considered particularly [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] for those born on particular days of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmta.com/Thai-Birthday.htm ''Thai birth day colors and Buddha image'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is always represented with certain physical attributes, and in specified dress and specified poses. Each pose, and particularly the position and gestures of the Buddha's hands, has a defined meaning which is familiar to Buddhists.  In other Buddhist countries, different but related iconography is used, for example the [[mudra]]s in Indian art.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Buddha Reclining Bangkok Thailand by D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Reclining Buddha]]

For Buddhists, the correct depiction of the Buddha is not an [[wikt:anabolism|anabolistic]] matter; Buddhists believe that a properly rendered Buddha image is a [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]]: an actual spiritual emanation of the Buddha, which possesses supernatural qualities. Although the Buddha is not a god, Buddhists seek to communicate with the supernatural world through Buddha images, making offerings to them and praying before them.
[[Image:Buddhistspraying.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Buddhists venerating a Buddha image ([[Wat Doi Suthep]], Chiang Mai, Thailand)]]

Buddha images are not intended to be naturalistic representations of what Gautama Buddha looked like. There are no contemporary images of him, and the oldest Buddha images date from 500 to 600 years after his lifetime. But Buddhists believe that Buddha images represent an ideal reality of the Buddha, and that every Buddha image stands at the end of a succession of images reaching back to the Buddha himself.

When creating a Buddha image, the artist is expected to be in a spiritual and mental state (''samādhi'') that will enable him to visualise this ideal reality. There is no requirement that every Buddha image be identical, and in fact there is a wide variety of artistic styles and national traditions in representing the Buddha. There are, however, certain rules of representation that must be adhered to.

==Development==
The current range of postures in which the Buddha may be shown, and the gestures which may be depicted, evolved over the first millennium of the Buddhist era (roughly 500 BCE to 500 CE), mainly in [[India]], the original homeland of Buddhism.  The tradition of images that reached South-East Asia had been changed in the later 5th century CE, apparently first at [[Sarnath]] in India.  The new "Sarnath image type" or "Gupta period Buddhist image" differs from earlier Buddha images, such as those in [[Greco-Buddhist art]], in a number of respects: the gaze is lowered, the clinging robes disclose no male genital bulge, the robe lacks folds, and there are different body proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L., pp. 318-319, "The Importance of Gupta-period Sculpture in Southeast Asian Art History", in ''Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange'', Editors Pierre-Yves Manguin, A. Mani, Geoff Wade, 2011, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, {{ISBN|9814311162}}, 9789814311168, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FuCYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the early part of this period, the Buddha was usually shown giving a general gesture of benediction, with the right hand held at shoulder-height with the palm facing forward and the fingers together and slightly bent. By the end of the [[Gupta Empire]] (about 550 CE), the canon of representation had become more varied, with the seated meditative position (''dhyāna mudrā'' - see below) becoming common, particularly in [[Sri Lanka]]. By the 7th century CE the canon was largely as it is seen today.

As Buddhism spread from India to other countries, variations in the depiction of the Buddha evolved. This article describes the canon of Buddha representation in Thailand and Laos. This canon was not formalised until the 19th century, as part of the general project of "modernisation" that followed the Buddhist world's encounter with Western civilisation. A key figure in this process was the Siamese royal prince and Buddhist monk [[Paramanuchit Chinorot]], a son of King [[Rama I]], who in 1814 was appointed administrator of the [[Wat Pho]] royal temple in [[Bangkok]]. At the request of King [[Rama III]], Paramanuchit described and represented 40 different postures of the Buddha in an illustrated treatise called ''Pathama Sambodhikatha''. Some of these, such as "Buddha threading a needle," were new, although justified through reference to the literary accounts of the Buddha's life. Paramanuchit's illustrations were later rendered as bronze miniatures, which can be seen today at [[Wat Phra Kaew]] in Bangkok and serve as templates for the creation of modern Buddhist imagery.

==Attributes of the Buddha==
[[Image:Buddhaimage3.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Reclining Buddha]] (Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]] [[:th:ปางปรินิพพาน]]

The ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'', a [[Pāli]] text of the 1st century BCE, gives a list of 32 physical attributes of the Buddha. Some of these are poetic or fanciful ("legs like an antelope's," "ankles like rounded shells"), while others are more specific: feet with level tread, projecting heels, long and slender fingers and toes, a tuft of hair between the eyebrows. Although it is not required that Buddha images reflect all of these attributes, many of them have acquired canonical status.

Most curiously, the Buddha is said to have had a protuberance on the top of his skull, the ''usnīsa''. This is sometimes shown as a spire or spike, and sometimes only as a small bump. The Buddha always has a serene expression or a faint smile. The Buddha is also always depicted with very [[Stretching (body piercing)|long earlobes]]. This is attributed to his earlier life as a prince, weighed down by material possession, but has since come to symbolize wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2714/why-do-statues-of-buddha-have-long-earlobes Why do statues of Buddha have long earlobes? What's the difference between fat Buddha and regular Buddha? (2007) ''Straight Dope'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posture and dress==

The Buddha may be depicted in one of four postures:
*Sitting: If seated, the Buddha may be shown in one of three different positions
:In the "heroic posture" (''vīrāsana''), with the legs folded over each other
:In the "adamantine posture" (''vajrāsana''; also known as "[[lotus position]]"), with the legs crossed so that the soles of both feet are turned up
:In the position of a person sitting in a chair (''pralambanāsana'')
*Standing: If standing, the Buddha may be shown either with his feet together, or with one foot forward
*Walking
*[[Reclining Buddha|Reclining]]: The reclining posture may represent the Buddha resting or sleeping, but more usually represents the ''mahāparinabbāna'': the Buddha's final state of enlightenment before his death

[[Image:Buddha Park.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Modern gigantic rendition of the ''reclining Buddha'' in [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat|Bunleua Sulilat]]'s [[Buddha Park]].]]
The Buddha is nearly always depicted wearing a monastic robe, of the type worn by Buddhist monks today. The robe may be shown as worn in the "covering mode" (draped over both shoulders) or in the "open mode" (leaving the right shoulder and breast uncovered). The robe is a representation of the Buddha's humility. (Gautama was originally a prince, who renounced the world to seek enlightenment, and his original robe was made from the shroud of a corpse.) The robe is sometimes shown as diaphanous, transparent or billowing mysteriously, suggesting the spiritual power emanating from the Buddha. Buddha images are often draped with real robes, which are renewed periodically, usually at major festivals. The Buddha may also be shown wearing royal attire, but this is uncommon.

==Hand gestures==
[[Image:Buddhaimage4.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of "the Buddha meditating." The Buddha's hands are in the ''dhyāna mudrā'' position ([[Wat Xieng Thong]], Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]]

The most important aspect of the iconography of the Buddha is gestures made with the hands, known as ''[[Mudra|mudrā]]''. These gestures have meanings which are known throughout the Buddhist world, and when combined with the postures described above, give a complete representation, usually associated with a particular incident in the life of the Buddha.

The six ''mudrā'' associated with the Buddha are:
*[[Phra Mae Thorani|Touching the earth]] (''Bhūmiśparṣa mudrā'') [[:th:ปางมารวิชัย]] ''pang maa-rá-wí-chai'': the right arm rests on the right thigh with the fingers pointing downwards, but not always touching the earth (as can be seen in the image at the top of this page). The left hand rests in the ''dhyāna mudrā'' position in the Buddha's lap. This ''mudrā'' is called in [[Pali|Pāḷi]] and [[Sanskrit]] "calling the earth to witness (to his fulfilment of the perfections, [[parami|pāramī]]). In Thai it is known as "Buddha subduing [[Mara (demon)|Māra]]" (the demon who tried to prevent him attaining enlightenment by various means). This is by far the most commonly depicted ''mudrā''.
*Meditation (''Dhyāna mudrā'') [[:th:ปางสมาธิ]] ''pang sà-măa-tí'': the hands are shown lying flat in the Buddha's lap, palms upward. This ''mudrā'' is associated with a seated Buddha. It shows that the Buddha is disciplining his mind through mental concentration, a necessary step to achieving enlightenment.
*Charity (''Varana mudrā'') [[:th:ปางประทานพร]] ''pang bprà-taan pon'': the right arm is shown pendent (extended downwards), with the open palm turned to the front and the fingers extended. This ''mudrā'' is usually associated with a standing Buddha. This position can signify either that the Buddha is granting blessings or receiving charitable offerings.
*Fearlessness (''Abhāya mudrā'') [[:th:ปางประทานอภัย]] ''pang bprà-taan à-pai'': either one or both arms are shown bent at the elbow and the wrist, with the palm facing outwards and the fingers pointing upwards. It shows the Buddha either displaying fearlessness in the face of adversity, or enjoining others to do so. Right hand raised is also called "calming animals" [[:th:ปางโปรดสัตว์]] ''pang pròht sàt''; both hands raised is also called "forbidding the relatives" [[:th:ปางห้ามญาติ]] ''pang ham yat''. These '''mudrā'' are usually associated with a standing Buddha, but seated representations are not uncommon.

[[Image:Buddhaimage6.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of "the Buddha preaching on reason," with the Buddha's hands in the double ''abhāya mudrā'' position (Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]]
*Reasoning and exposition (''Vitarka mudrā''): the arm and hand are positioned in the same manner as in the ''abhāya mudrā'', except that the thumb and forefinger are brought together. The gesture can be made with either the right or left hand (usually the right), but not both. This mudra signifies an appeal to reason, or the giving of instruction. Since the Buddha is appealing to reason, the gesture is often interpreted as an appeal for peace.
*Setting the wheel in motion (''Dharmachakrā mudrā''): the hands are held in front of the chest, with both hands in the ''vitarka mudrā'' position, with the fingers of the left hand resting in the palm of the right hand. This is a less common ''mudrā'' since it refers to a particular episode in the Buddha's life: his first sermon, when he "set the wheel (of his life's work) in motion." It can be used for both seated and standing images.

Over the centuries combinations and variations of these six ''mudrā'' have evolved. For example, the "double ''abhāya mudrā''", with both hands held up in the ''abhāya mudrā'' position, became common in Thailand and Laos in the 16th century, and is now one of the most common representations of the Buddha in south-east Asian countries. It is sometimes interpreted as "Buddha teaching on reason." As artists wished to depict more of the specific incidents in the life of the Buddha, new, secondary ''mudrās'' evolved, such as "Buddha holding an alms bowl", "Buddha receiving a mango" and Buddha performing various miracles. Many of these originated in [[Burma]] and then spread to other parts of the Buddhist world.

The '''''Istituto Superiore di Sanità''''' (National Institute of Health), also '''ISS''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] public institution that, as the leading technical-scientific body of the Italian National Health Service (''[[Servizio Sanitario Nazionale]]''), performs [[research]], [[Clinical trial|trials]], control, [[counseling]], [[documentation]] and [[training]] for public health. The Institute is under the supervision of the ''Ministero della Salute'' (Ministry of Health).

==History==
[[Image:ISS 050207.JPG|350px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Headquarters of ISS in [[Rome]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
The official opening of the ISS, called ''Istituto di Sanità Pubblica'' (Institute of Public Health), took place on April 21, 1934.
The construction of the main building in [[Rome]], designed by architect Giuseppe Amendola, started on July 6, 1931 and it was financed by the American [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

In 1941 the ''Istituto di Sanità Pubblica'' assumed its present name of ''Istituto Superiore di Sanità''

In 1958 the ISS came under the protection of the [[Ministry of Health (Italy)|Ministry of Health]], from the [[Ministry of Interior]].

'''''Karius and Bactus''''' ({{ISBN|0961539410}}) ({{lang-no|Karius og Baktus}} is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[children's novel]] written and illustrated by [[Thorbjørn Egner]]. The book was first published in 1949 and produced as a 15-minute [[animatronics|puppet animation film]] by [[Ivo Caprino]] in 1954. An English translation by Mike Sevig and Turi Olderheim was published in the United States in 1986.

The main characters are Karius (black haired) and Bactus (red haired). Their names are puns on [[Caries]] and [[Bacteria]], and they are two small "[[tooth troll]]s" that live inside cavities in the teeth of a boy named [[Jens (given name)|Jens]]. They have a very good life, especially when Jens eats [[white bread]] with [[syrup]] and fails to [[Toothbrush|brush his teeth]] afterwards. Eventually their homes are destroyed by the work of a [[dentist]] and they are rinsed out of Jens' mouth through proper [[Dentistry|dental care]].

The story of Karius and Bactus, with its humorous illustrations and important message, has become a classic of Norwegian children's literature. Since its publication, the idea of "tooth trolls" has been used as a pedagogical device for generations of Scandinavian children.

[[File:Mangroves in Kannur, India.jpg|thumb|Mangroves are adapted to saline conditions]]

A '''mangrove''' is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal [[saline water|saline]] or [[brackish water]]. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species.  Mangroves occur worldwide in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]], mainly between latitudes [[25th parallel north|{{formatnum:25}}°&amp;nbsp;N]] and [[25th parallel south|{{formatnum:25}}°&amp;nbsp;S]]. The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was {{convert|137,800|km2}}, spanning 118 countries and territories.&lt;ref name="Giri2010"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2010 |title= Status and distribution of mangrove forests of the world using earth observation satellite data |journal= [[Global Ecology and Biogeography]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=154–159 |doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x |last1=Giri |first1=C. |last2=Ochieng |first2=E. |last3=Tieszen |first3=L.L. |last4=Zhu |first4=Z. |last5=Singh |first5=A. |last6=Loveland |first6=T. |last7=Masek |first7=J. |lastauthoramp=yes |last8=Duke |first8=N. |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/referata/arq/2010_09_Marilia/Giri_etal_2010.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also called [[halophyte]]s, and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex [[root]] system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low oxygen (anoxic) conditions of waterlogged mud.

The word is used in at least three senses: (1) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or ''mangal'',&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth, Peter J. (1999) ''The Biology of Mangroves'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|0-19-850222-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2012}} for which the terms ''mangrove forest [[biome]]'', and ''mangrove swamp'' are also used, (2) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in the mangrove swamp, and (3) narrowly to refer to the mangrove [[Family (biology)|family]] of plants, the [[Rhizophoraceae]], or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of the genus ''[[Rhizophora]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The mangrove biome, or mangal, is a distinct saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat characterized by [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure [[seawater]] (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the [[salinity]] of ocean seawater (up to 9%).&lt;ref name=NHMI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |title=Morphological and Physiological Adaptations: Florida mangrove website |publisher=Nhmi.org |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204222702/http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathias /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "[[wikt:mangrove#English|mangrove]]" comes to English from Spanish (perhaps by way of Portuguese), and is likely to originate from [[Guaraní language|Guarani]]. It was earlier "mangrow" (from Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|mangue}}'' or Spanish ''{{lang|es|mangle}}''), but this word was corrupted via [[folk etymology]] influence of the word "[[Grove (nature)|grove]]".

==Ecology==
[[File:World map mangrove distribution.jpg|thumb|The world's mangrove forests in 2000]]
Mangrove swamps (mangals) are found in tropical and subtropical [[tidal]] areas. Areas where mangals occur include [[estuary|estuaries]] and marine shorelines.&lt;ref name=Mathias/&gt;

The [[intertidal]] existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater.

At low tide, organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and desiccation, and are then cooled and flooded by the tide. Thus, for a plant to survive in this environment, it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity, temperature, and moisture, as well as a number of other key environmental factors—thus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community.

About 110 species are considered "mangroves", in the sense of being a tree that grows in such a saline swamp,&lt;ref name="Mathias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html |title=Mangal (Mangrove). '&amp;#39;World Vegetation'&amp;#39;. Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, University of California at Los Angeles |publisher=Botgard.ucla.edu |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209010910/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus, ''Rhizophora''. However, a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species. It is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the Caribbean to feature only three or four tree species. For comparison, the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species, but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity. Though the trees themselves are few in species, the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other species.

Mangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], high [[salinity]] and frequent tidal [[inundation]]. Each species has its own solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason why, on some shorelines, [[Rhizophora|mangrove tree species]] show distinct zonation. Small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment. Therefore, the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions, such as tidal inundation and salinity, but may also be influenced by other factors, such as [[predation]] of plant seedlings by crabs.

Once established, mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow, thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring. The fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of [[Heavy metals|heavy (trace) metals]] which [[colloidal particle]]s in the sediments have scavenged from the water. Mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments, often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during [[hurricanes]]), and tsunamis.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Mazda|first1=Y.|last2=Kobashi|first2=D.|last3=Okada|first3=S.|year=2005|title=Tidal-Scale Hydrodynamics within Mangrove Swamps|url=|journal=Wetlands Ecology and Management | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 647–655 | doi=10.1007/s11273-005-0613-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danielsen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118387 |pmid=16254180 |title=The Asian Tsunami: A Protective Role for Coastal Vegetation |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=643 |year=2005 |last1=Danielsen |first1=F |last2=Sørensen |first2=M.

Mangrove swamps' effectiveness in terms of erosion control can sometimes be overstated. Wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baird |first1=Andrew |date=26 December 2006 |title=False Hopes and Natural Disasters |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/opinion/26baird.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; so their effect on erosion is measured over long periods.&lt;ref name="Massel" /&gt; Their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is in relation to events such as storm surges and tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.008 |pmid=15964259 |title=How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami? |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=R443–7 |year=2005 |last1=Dahdouh-Guebas |first1=F |last2=Jayatissa |first2=L.P |last3=Di Nitto |first3=D |last4=Bosire |first4=J.O |last5=Lo Seen |first5=D |last6=Koedam |first6=N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique ecosystem found in the intricate mesh of mangrove [[root]]s offers a quiet marine region for young organisms.&lt;ref name=BOS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1588-0 |pmid=24391259 |pmc=3873073 |title=Ontogenetic habitat shift, population growth, and burrowing behavior of the Indo-Pacific beach star, Archaster typicus (Echinodermata; Asteroidea) |journal=Marine Biology |volume=158 |issue=3 |pages=639–648 |year=2010 |last1=Bos |first1=Arthur R |last2=Gumanao |first2=Girley S |last3=Van Katwijk |first3=Marieke M |last4=Mueller |first4=Benjamin |last5=Saceda |first5=Marjho M |last6=Tejada |first6=Rosie Lynn P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where roots are permanently submerged, the organisms they host include [[algae]], [[barnacle]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, and [[bryozoan]]s, which all require a hard surface for anchoring while they filter feed. [[Shrimp]]s and [[Thalassinidea|mud lobsters]] use the muddy bottoms as their home.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encarta]] Encyclopedia 2005''. "Seashore", by [[Heidi Nepf]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mangrove crab]]s munch on the mangrove leaves, adding nutrients to the mangal muds for other bottom feeders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-001-0847-7 |pmid=28547499 |bibcode=2002Oecol.131....1S |title=Paradoxical selective feeding on a low-nutrient diet: Why do mangrove crabs eat leaves? |journal=Oecologia |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2002 |last1=Skov |first1=Martin W |last2=Hartnoll |first2=Richard G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least some cases, export of carbon fixed in mangroves is important in coastal food webs.

Mangrove plantations in [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[India]] host several commercially important species of fishes and crustaceans. Despite restoration efforts, developers and others have removed over half of the world's mangroves in recent times.

Mangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of [[termite]]s.  It becomes peat in good geochemical, sedimentary and tectonic conditions.&lt;ref name="Vane"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ggge.20194 |title=Degradation of mangrove tissues by arboreal termites (Nasutitermes acajutlae) and their role in the mangrove C cycle (Puerto Rico): Chemical characterization and organic matter provenance using bulk δ13C, C/N, alkaline CuO oxidation-GC/MS, and solid-state |journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=3176 |year=2013 |last1=Vane |first1=Christopher H |last2=Kim |first2=Alexander W |last3=Moss-Hayes |first3=Vicky |last4=Snape |first4=Colin E |last5=Diaz |first5=Miguel Castro |last6=Khan |first6=Nicole S |last7=Engelhart |first7=Simon E |last8=Horton |first8=Benjamin P |bibcode=2013GGG....14.3176V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangrove involved. In Puerto Rico the red ([[Rhizophora mangle]]), white ([[Laguncularia racemosa]]) and black ([[Avicennia germinans]]) mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions so the carbon content varies between the species as well between the different tissues of the plant e.g. leaf matter vs roots.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

In Puerto Rico there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations which are dominated by red mangroves to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt; Mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt; Using this it is possible to attempt to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem for thousands of years by using sediment cores.&lt;ref name="versteegh"&gt;Versteegh, G. J. M., et al. (2004). "Taraxerol and Rhizophora pollen as proxies for tracking past mangrove ecosystems." Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 68(3): 411–422.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to tidal flushing of mangrove forests.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

In order to understand peat formation by mangroves, it is important to understand the conditions they grew in, and how they decayed.  Termites are an important part of this decay, and so an understanding of their action on the organic matter is crucial to the chemical stabilization of mangrove peats.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

Mangroves are an important source of [[blue carbon]]. Globally, mangroves stored 4.19 Pg of carbon in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Stuart E.|last2=Friess|first2=Daniel A.|date=2018-02-26|title=Global carbon stocks and potential emissions due to mangrove deforestation from 2000 to 2012|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0090-4|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=8|issue=3|pages=240–244|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0090-4|issn=1758-678X|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..240H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two percent of global mangrove carbon was lost between 2000 and 2012, equivalent to a maximum potential of 316,996,250 t of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Biology==
Of the recognized 110 mangrove species, only about 54 species in 20 genera from 16 [[Family (biology)|families]] constitute the "true mangroves", species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats.&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; Demonstrating [[convergent evolution]], many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), [[Anaerobic environment|anaerobic]] soils and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangrove.&lt;ref name="Mathias" /&gt; The greatest biodiversity occurs in the mangal of [[New Guinea]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/distribution_of_coral_mangrove_and_seagrass_diversity/ |title=Distribution of coral, mangrove and seagrass diversity |publisher=Maps.grida.no |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305202831/http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/distribution_of_coral_mangrove_and_seagrass_diversity |archivedate=2010-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations to low oxygen===
[[File:Mangrove.jpg|thumb|A red mangrove, ''Rhizophora mangle''.]]
[[File:Mangroves.jpg|thumb|Above and below water view at the edge of the mangal.]]
[[Rhizophora mangle|Red mangroves]], which can survive in the most inundated areas, prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then absorb air through pores in their bark ([[lenticel]]s). [[Avicennia germinans|Black mangroves]] live on higher ground and make many [[pneumatophore]]s (specialised root-like structures which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in [[lenticel]]s.

These "breathing tubes" typically reach heights of up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and in some species, over 3 m. The four types of pneumatophores are stilt or prop type, snorkel or peg type, knee type, and ribbon or plank type. Knee and ribbon types may be combined with buttress roots at the base of the tree. The roots also contain wide [[aerenchyma]] to facilitate transport within the plants.

===Limiting salt intake===
[[File:Saltcrystals on avicennia marina var resinifera leaves.JPG|thumb|Salt crystals formed on grey mangrove leaf.]]
Red mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots which are highly [[suberin|suberised]] (impregnated with suberin), acting as an ultra-filtration mechanism to exclude [[sodium]] [[salts]] from the rest of the plant. Analysis of water inside mangroves has shown 90% to 97% of salt has been excluded at the roots. In a frequently cited concept that has become known as the "sacrificial leaf", salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves, which the plant then sheds. However, recent research suggests the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=L. Joseph |year=2010 |title=Sacrificial leaf hypothesis of mangroves |url=http://www.glomis.com/ej/pdf/EJ_8-4.pdf |work=ISME/GLOMIS Electronic Journal |publisher=GLOMIS |accessdate=21 January 2012 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red mangroves can also store salt in cell [[vacuole]]s. As seen in the photograph on the right, white or grey mangroves can secrete salts directly; they have two salt glands at each leaf base (correlating with their name—they are covered in white salt crystals).

===Limiting water loss===
Because of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils, mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their [[stomata]] (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange [[carbon dioxide]] gas and water vapour during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. Anthony Calfo, a noted [[aquarium]] author, observed anecdotally a red mangrove in captivity only grows if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-12/ac/feature/index.php |title=Calfo, Anthony (2006). '&amp;#39;Mangroves for the Marine Aquarium'&amp;#39; |publisher=Reefkeeping.com |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient uptake===
Because the soil is perpetually waterlogged, little free oxygen is available. Anaerobic [[bacteria]] liberate [[nitrogen]] gas, soluble ferrum ([[iron]]), inorganic [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfide]]s and [[methane]], which make the soil much less nutritious.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Pneumatophores ([[aerial root]]s) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere, and other nutrients such as [[iron]], from the inhospitable soil. Mangroves store gases directly inside the roots, processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide.

===Increasing survival of offspring===
[[File:Plody mangrovnika (Rhizophora mangle).jpg|thumb|Red mangrove seeds [[viviparity|germinate while still on the parent tree]].]]

In this harsh environment, mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive. Mangrove [[seed]]s are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal. Unlike most plants, whose seeds germinate in soil, many mangroves (e.g. [[Rhizophora mangle|red mangrove]]) are [[Vivipary|viviparous]], whose seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g. ''[[Aegialitis]]'', ''[[Avicennia]]'' and ''[[Aegiceras]]''), or out through the fruit (e.g. ''[[Rhizophora]]'', ''[[Ceriops]]'', ''[[Bruguiera]]'' and ''[[Nypa (genus)|Nypa]]'') to form a [[propagule]] (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via [[photosynthesis]].

The mature propagule then drops into the water, which can transport it great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, its density changes so the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The following listing (modified from Tomlinson, 1986) gives the number of species of mangroves in each listed plant genus and family. Mangrove environments in the Eastern Hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the New World. Genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives, in combination with fossil evidence, suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment, and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the Tertiary with little global extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ricklefs, R.

Mangroves can be found in over 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The largest percentage of mangroves is found between the 5° N and 5° S latitudes. Approximately 75% of world’s mangroves are found in just 15 countries.

===Africa===
There are important mangrove swamps in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and [[Madagascar]], with the latter even admixing at the coastal verge with [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forests]].

Nigeria has Africa's largest mangrove concentration, spanning 36,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Colombia]] possesses large mangrove forests on both its Caribbean and Pacific coasts.

The Mangrove forests of [[Suriname]] have a height of 20–25 m and are found mainly in the coastal area. There are six types of mangroves, namely two types of parwa or black mangroves, three types of red mangroves (mangro) and a small mangrove species (white mangrove, akira or tjila).&lt;ref&gt;Environmental statistics of Suriname 2014. http://www.statistics-suriname.org/index.php/statistieken/downloads/category/34-milieu-publicatie-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundarbans in the [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]] delta extend from the [[Hooghly River]] in [[West Bengal]] to the [[Baleswar River]] in [[Bangladesh]], covering an area of about {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This area comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, [[mudflat]]s and barren land. It is intersected by [[tidal]] streams and channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans, viz [[Sundarbans National Park]], [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]] Wildlife Sanctuaries are enlisted as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. [[Biodiversity]] includes at least 27 mangrove species, 40 mammal, 35 reptile and 260 bird species. More than 2.5 million people are estimated to live in the vicinity of the Sundarbans, making them one of the world's most densely populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Giri, C., Pengra, B., Zhu, Z., Singh, A. and Tieszen, L.

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
It is the largest mangroves region and the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world.
Sundri (''[[Heritiera fomes]]'') trees provide durable hard timber. Palm, coconut, keora, agar, also grow in some parts of the delta. India's mangrove forests are habitat for [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), turtles, and snakes. This region is part of the Great Sundarbans and covers a National Park, Tiger reserve and a Biosphere Reserve.&lt;ref name="walkthroughindiaTop5_wetland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/walkthroughs/top-5-largest-wetland-and-ramsar-sites-in-india/|title=Largest Wetland and Ramsar Sites in India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sundarbans was designated a Ramsar site on May 21, 1992. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective flood barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around [[Kolkata]] against the result of cyclone activity. 
Sundarbans is home to many different species of birds, mammals, insects, reptiles and fish. It is estimated that there may be found more than 120 species of fish and over 260 species of birds and more than fifty species of reptiles and eight amphibians.

====Indo-Malaya Ecozone====
Mangroves occur on Asia's south coast, throughout the Indian subcontinent, in all [[Southeast Asia]]n countries, and on islands in the Indian Ocean, [[Persian gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], [[South China Sea]], [[East China Sea]] and the Pacific.

The mangal is particularly prevalent in the deltas of large Asian rivers. The [[Sundarbans]] is the largest mangrove forest in the world, located in the Ganges River delta in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], [[India]].

The Pichavaram mangroves in [[Tamil Nadu]] is India's one of the largest mangrove forests. The [[Bhitarkanika Mangroves]] Forest of Odisha, by the Bay of Bengal, is India's second largest mangrove forest.{{Citation needed|reason=claim|date=September 2014}} Other major mangals occur on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] and the [[Gulf of Kutch]] in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mangroveindia.org/ Mangroves of India] – URL retrieved November 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vietnam]], mangrove forests grow along the southern coast, including two forests: the [[Can Gio Mangrove Forest]] [[biosphere reserve]] and the [[U Minh Thuong National Park|U Minh mangrove forest]] in the sea and coastal region of [[Kiên Giang Province|Kiên Giang]], [[Cà Mau Province|Cà Mau]] and [[Bạc Liêu Province|Bạc Liêu]] provinces.

The mangrove forests of Kompong Sammaki in [[Cambodia]] are of major ecological and cultural importance, as the human population relies heavily on the crabs and fish that live in the roots.

The three most important mangrove forests of [[Taiwan]] are: [[Tamsui River]] in Taipei, Jhonggang River in Miaoli and the [[Sihcao Wetlands]] in [[Tainan]]. According to research, four main types of mangrove exist in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fan |first1=K.C. |title=Mangroves in Taiwan: current status and restoration projects. |url=http://bft.cirad.fr/cd/BFT_273_43-54.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some places have been developed as scenic areas, such as the [[Timber rafting|log raft]] routes in Sihcao.

=====Indonesia=====
In the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]], mangroves occur around much of [[Western New Guinea|Papua province]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and the surrounding islands. Further north, they are found along the coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Indonesia has around 9.36 million hectares of mangrove forests, but 48% is categorized as 'moderately damaged' and 23% as 'badly damaged'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/07/71-indonesian-mangrove-forests-damaged-minister.html |title=71% of Indonesian mangrove forests damaged: minister |work=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118061854/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/07/71-indonesian-mangrove-forests-damaged-minister.html |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
[[File:GWR 2013- Certificate.jpg|thumb|upright|The Guinness World Record certificate of achievement to Sindh Forest Department, Govt of Sindh, Pakistan]]
Pakistani mangroves are located mainly along the [[Indus River Delta|delta]] of the [[Indus River]] (the [[Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves]] [[ecoregion]]). Major mangrove forests are found on the coastline of the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]].

In [[Karachi]], land reclamation projects have led to the cutting down of mangrove forests for commercial and urban development. On 22 June 2013, Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh, Pakistan, with the help of 300 local coastal volunteer planters set the Guinness World Record by planting 847,250 mangrove saplings at Kharo Chan, Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan in a little over 12 hours. This is the highest number of saplings planted within a day under the Guinness World Record category of "Maximum Number of Trees Planted in a Day".

Sindh Forest Department, Government of Sindh Mangrove has played pioneer role for the conservation and protection of the mangroves in the Indus Delta since late 1950s when it was handed over the areas. A breakthrough success is the re-introduction of ''[[Rhizophora mucronata]]'' into the Indus Delta, which had become extinct there. More recently, a threatened mangrove shrub, ''[[Ceriops tagal]]'', has also been successfully re-introduced. A third species, ''[[Aegiceras corniculatum]]'', is under trials at the nursery stage.

A gigantic initiative is under in the Sindh, Pakistan, to rehabilitate the degraded and blank mangrove mudflats. Since 2010 alone, around 55,000 Hectares of such area has been planted and rehabilitated. During this period, through concerted efforts and a rigorous conservation policy adopted by the Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh and the federal govt. a mangrove resource base of 150,000 plus Hectares has been created, with the support of local coastal communities. International organizations like IUCN and WWF are also playing critical role to support this initiative of the government. Other achievements include: (1) Declaring all the mangrove forests in the Indus Delta as Protected Forests in December 2010; Constitution of a Mangrove Conservation Committee at the provincial level which includes all stakeholders as members and overall awareness of the importance of mangroves and its ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Mangrove Planting"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pakagri.blogspot.com/2013/06/by-planting-750000-mangroves-pakistan.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130624220628/http://pakagri.blogspot.com/2013/06/by-planting-750000-mangroves-pakistan.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 June 2013 | title=By planting 750,000 mangroves, Pakistan claims new world record.  | date=22 June 2013 | publisher=[[Express Tribune]] |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
Mangrove forests are present in [[Iran]] between 25°11′N to 27°52′N, in the northern parts of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Sea of Oman]]. Pockets of the biome extend (from southwest to southeast) along the shores of the maritime provinces [[Bushehr]], [[Hormozgan]], and [[Sistan and Balouchestan]].

Forests on and near the island of [[Qeshm]] in the Persian Gulf are dominated by the species ''[[Avicennia marina]]'', known locally as the "hara" or "harra" tree, and cover an area of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km by 20&amp;nbsp;km. This area is protected as the UNESCO [[Mangrove forests of Qeshm|Hara Biosphere Reserve]], where commercial use is restricted to fishing (mainly [[shrimp]]), tourist boat trips, and limited mangrove cutting for animal feed.

====Middle East====
Oman, near Muscat, supports large areas of mangroves, in particular at Shinas, Qurm Park and Mahout Island. In Arabic, mangrove trees are known as ''qurm'', thus the mangrove area in Oman is known as Qurm Park. A small mangrove area is present in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Mangroves are also present extensively in neighbouring Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Rouphael, Tony ;Turak, Emre and Brodie, Jon (1992) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090919204110/http://www.actfr.jcu.edu.au/idc/groups/public/documents/journal_article/jcudev_015628.pdf "Chapter 3: Seagrasses and Mangroves of Yemen's Red Sea"] In DouAbal, A. et al. (editors) (1992) ''Protection of Marine Ecosystems of the Red Sea Coast of Yemen'' Global Environment Facility, United Nations Development Programme, New York, pp. 41–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove is also widely seen in Tarut Island, east of Qatif in Saudi Arabia. In addition, large forest of mangrove surround the coast to the south of Qatif (Siahat Beach). Nonetheless, because of sea land re-claiming the mangrove is being cut down which makes lots of sea fish losses their natural habitats.

The mangrove forests that cover thousands of hectares of land along the UAE shoreline form an integral part of its coastal ecosystem. The [[Environment Agency Abu Dhabi|Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD)]] is currently working on rehabilitation, conservation and protection of mangrove forests in seven key sites in Abu Dhabi including: Saadiyat Island, Jubail Island, Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve (which also comprises famous Bu Tinah Island), Bu Syayeef Protected Area, Ras Gharab, the Eastern Corniche and Ras Ghanada.

====New Zealand====
[[New Zealand]] also has mangrove forests extending to around 38°S (similar to Australia's latitudinal limit): the southernmost examples are at [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan Harbour]] (37°48′S) on the west coast and Ohiwa Harbour (near [[Opotiki]], 38°00′S) on the east coast.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
''[[Avicennia marina]] australasica'' is the only mangrove in New Zealand.

Adequate data are only available for about half of the global area of mangroves. However, of those areas for which data has been collected, it appears that 35% of the mangroves have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) ''Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Synthesis'' (p.2) Island Press, Washington, DC.

Grassroots efforts to save mangroves from development are becoming more popular as their benefits become more widely known. In the [[Bahamas]], for example, active efforts to save mangroves are occurring on the islands of [[Bimini]] and [[Great Guana Cay]]. In [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as well, efforts are underway to protect a mangrove threatened by the construction of a steelmill and a port.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In Thailand, community management has been effective in restoring damaged mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/thailand-mangrove-restoration-community-management.html |title=Thailand – Trang Province – Taking Back the Mangroves with Community Management &amp;#124; The EcoTipping Points Project |publisher=Ecotippingpoints.org |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within northern Ecuador mangrove regrowth is reported in almost all estuaries and stems primarily from local actors responding to earlier periods of deforestation in the Esmeraldas region.&lt;ref name="mingaonline.uach.cl"/&gt;

Mangroves have been reported to be able to help buffer against [[tsunami]], [[cyclone]]s, and other storms. One village in [[Tamil Nadu]] was protected from tsunami destruction—the villagers in [[Naluvedapathy]] planted 80,244 saplings to get into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. This created a kilometre-wide belt of trees of various varieties. When the tsunami struck, much of the land around the village was flooded, but the village itself suffered minimal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treecouncil.org.uk |title=Tree News, Spring/Summer 2005, Publisher Felix Press |publisher=Treecouncil.org.uk |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforestation==
[[File:Mangroves of Bohol.png|thumb|Mangroves in [[Bohol]], Philippines.]]

In some areas, mangrove reforestation and [[mangrove restoration]] is also underway. Red mangroves are the most common choice for cultivation, used particularly in [[marine aquariums]] in a [[sump]] to reduce [[nitrates]] and other [[nutrients]] in the water. Mangroves also appear in home [[aquariums]], and as ornamental plants, such as in [[Japan]].

In Senegal, [[Haïdar El Ali]] has started the {{Il|fr|Oceanium de Dakar}} project, which (amongst others) focuses on reforesting several areas with mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanium.blogspot.com/ |title=Oceanium de Dakar |publisher=Oceanium.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manzanar Mangrove Initiative is an ongoing experiment in [[Arkiko]], [[Eritrea]], part of the Manzanar Project founded by [[Gordon H. Sato]], establishing new mangrove plantations on the coastal [[mudflat]]s. Initial plantings failed, but observation of the areas where mangroves did survive by themselves led to the conclusion that nutrients in water flow from inland were important to the health of the mangroves. Trials with the Eritrean Ministry of Fisheries followed, and a planting system was designed to provide the nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron missing from seawater.&lt;ref name="NatGeo2007-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SocWetlandSci"/&gt;

The propagules are planted inside a reused galvanized steel can with the bottom knocked out; a small piece of iron and a pierced plastic bag with fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphorus are buried with the propagule. {{As of|2007}}, after six years of planting, 700,000 mangroves are growing; providing stock feed for sheep and habitat for oysters, crabs, other bivalves, and fish.&lt;ref name="NatGeo2007-02"&gt;{{cite web

==National studies==
In terms of local and national studies of mangrove loss, the case of Belize's mangroves is illustrative in its contrast to the global picture. A recent, satellite-based study&lt;ref name="maps.cathalac.org"/&gt;—funded by the World Wildlife Fund and conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC)—indicates Belize's mangrove cover declined by a mere 2% over a 30-year period. The study was born out of the need to verify the popular conception that mangrove clearing in Belize was rampant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/art/Pelican_Review.pdf |title=Pelican_Cays_Review |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the assessment showed, between 1980 and 2010, under {{convert|4,000|acre|km2}} of mangroves had been cleared, although clearing of mangroves near Belize's main coastal settlements (e.g. [[Belize City]] and San Pedro) was relatively high. The rate of loss of Belize's mangroves—at 0.07% per year between 1980 and 2010—was much lower than Belize's overall rate of forest clearing (0.6% per year in the same period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servir.net/servir_bz_forest_cover_1980-2010.pdf Cherrington, E.A., Ek, E., Cho, P., Howell, B.F., Hernandez, B.E., Anderson, E.R., Flores, A.I., Garcia, B.C., Sempris, E., and D.E.

The '''mineralogy of Mars''' is the [[chemical composition]] of rocks and [[soil]] that encompass the surface of [[Mars]]. Various [[orbital spaceflight|orbital craft]]s have used [[spectroscopic]] methods to identify the signature of some [[minerals]].  The [[Lander (spacecraft)|planetary landers]] performed concrete [[chemical analysis]] of the [[soil]] in rocks to further identify and confirm the presence of other minerals. The only samples of Martian rocks that are on [[Earth]] are in the form of [[meteorites]].  The elemental and atmospheric composition along with planetary conditions is essential in knowing what minerals can be formed from these base parts.

== Mineral Composition ==

The surface [[geology of Mars]] is somewhere between the [[basalt]] or [[andesite]] rocks on Earth.  This led to the formation of minerals similar to what is found on Earth.  The presence of [[iron oxide]] gives the surface the “rust” color that is associated with Mars, the Red Planet.  The presence of [[perchlorate]], in high percentages, forms highly [[saline soils]], which could produce liquid water.&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;Head, J.W., Marchant, D.R., and Kreslavsky, M.A., 2008, Formation of gullies on Mars:  Link to recent climate history and insulation microenvironments implicate surface water flow origin:  PNAS, vol. 105, p. 13258-13263&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alteration of Martian rocks into [[carbonate]] and [[phyllosilicate]] minerals occurred earlier in Mars history when water was present in large quantities.&lt;ref name="Mustard"&gt;Mustard, J.F., Pelkey, S.M., Ehlmann, B.L., Roach, L., et. al, 2008, Hydrated silicate minerals on Mars observed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM instrument: Nature, Vol. 454, p. 305-309.&lt;/ref&gt;  Orbital instruments and Landers not only identified new minerals but in some cases also confirmed the presence of minerals detected by the others.

== Orbital Instruments ==
Orbital crafts sent to Mars provided data on surface geology mostly through [[spectroscopy]].  This data is used to determine possible minerals on the surface, and the types of instruments Landers would need in order to narrow down those minerals.

'''Mars Global Surveyor'''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Global Surveyor]]
Launched in 1996, it used the [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] (MOC), [[Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter]], and [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer]] to show layering on the surface, presence of surface ice, and the mineral hematite.  The presence of ice over the surface is essential to understanding why certain water bearing minerals are on Mars.

'''Mars Odyssey'''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Odyssey]]

Launched in 2001, although it carried multiple instruments only [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] was designed to look at minerals.   This allowed it to detect the presence of quartz, olivine, and hematite.

'''Mars Express'''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Express]]

Launched in 2003 the [[Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer]] (OMEGA) observed montmorillonite and localized phyllosilicate minerals.&lt;ref name="Mustard"/&gt;

'''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter '''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]

Launched in 2005 this orbiter carried multiple instruments which found the mineralogy to be dominated by [[mafic]] minerals such as olivine, mica, pyroxene and smectite clays such as kaolinite.  The [[HiRISE]] was used in determining the landing site for the [[Phoenix Lander]].  Using the [[CTX (camera)]] and [[CRISM]] instruments it was able to find phyllosilicate minerals, carbonate minerals, and oxides.  The [[SHARAD]] was used to detect carbonate dust layers.&lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;Byrne, S., 2009, The Polar Deposits of Mars: Annual Review Earth Planet Science, vol. 37 p.535-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landers ==
To date, mankind’s only way of carrying out experiments on the Martian surface has been to send probes to it.  The successful missions are able to carry out experiments that directly observe the composition of Martian soil and rocks. They are the key to verifying our observations of minerals, although currently they are limited to the uppermost area of the surface.

'''Mars Pathfinder'''
''Main article:'' [[Mars Pathfinder]]

'''Mars Exploration Rover Mission '''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Exploration Rover]]

Launched in 2003 it contained two separate rovers the [[Spirit rover]] and the [[Opportunity rover]].

'''Spirit'''
One of its instruments the [[Mössbauer spectrometer]] (MIMOS II) was designed to look at the iron bearing minerals on mars.  It is responsible for determining the presence of many specific iron oxides, which give the planet a red color.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, R.V., et al., 2004,  Mineralogy at Gusev Crater from the Mossbauer Spectrometer on the Spirit Rover: Science, vol. 305, p.833&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opportunity'''
Using the [[Mini-TES]] it was able to detect the presence of some calcium and magnesium rich sulfate minerals.  It also found feldspar, jarosite, pigeonite, clinopryoxene, and maskelynite along with detecting the presence of minerals found by the orbiters and other rovers.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;Christensen, P.R., et al., 2004, Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover: Science, vol. 306, p. 1733&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phoenix Lander'''

''Main article:'' [[Phoenix (spacecraft)]]

Most noted for landing in a polar region, it carries the WCL ([[Wet chemistry|Wet Chemistry Laboratory]]), which is a part of the MECA (Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer) instrument suite.  It is responsible for identifying perchlorate salts, and various cations such as magnesium, sodium, calcium, and potassium.  Along with [[TEGA]] it showed the presence of calcium carbonate, and minute traces of [[methane]].  Due to the analytical limits of MECA, the Phoenix was unable to determine the sulfur-based minerals detected by the Opportunity.&lt;ref name="Goetz"&gt;Goetz, W., 2010, Phoenix on Mars: American Scientist, vol. 98, p. 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naval Architecture Course of Study.png|alt=Curriculum of Naval Architecture |thumb|256x256px|General Course of Study leading to Naval Architecture degree]]
'''Naval architecture''', or '''naval engineering''', along with [[automotive engineering]] and [[aerospace engineering]], is an [[engineering]] discipline branch of [[vehicle engineering]], incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering as applied to the [[engineering design process]], [[shipbuilding]], maintenance, and operation of [[watercraft|marine vessels]] and structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rina.org.uk/careers_in_naval_architecture.html RINA – Careers in Naval Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biran, Adrian; (2003). Ship hydrostatics and stability (1st Ed.) – [[Butterworth-Heinemann]]. {{ISBN|0-7506-4988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, [[Shipbuilding|construction]], [[Sea trial|trials]], operation and maintenance, launching and [[dry-docking]] are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being [[Ship#Repair and conversion|modified]] (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or [[ship repair|repair]]). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet [[statutory]] and non-statutory requirements.
[[Image:01-bulb aero.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The hull of a [[racing yacht]] being lifted from the water for maintenance]]

==Main subjects==
The word "vessel" includes every description of [[watercraft]], including non-displacement craft, [[Ground effect vehicle|WIG craft]] and [[seaplane]]s, used or capable of being used as a means of [[Water transport|transportation on water]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention On The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], 1972,As Amended; [[International Maritime Organization]]; {{ISBN|92-801-4167-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal elements of naval architecture are:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis V, Edward (Ed.); (June 1989). Principles of Naval Architecture (2nd Rev.) Vol. 1 – [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]]. {{ISBN|0-939773-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrostatics===
[[Image:Lines plan en.svg|thumb|right|200px|Body plan of a ship showing the hull form]]
[[Hydrostatics]] concerns the conditions to which the vessel is subjected while at rest in water and to its ability to remain afloat. This involves computing [[buoyancy]], [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], and other hydrostatic properties such as [[Sailing ballast|trim]] (the measure of the longitudinal inclination of the vessel) and [[Ship stability|stability]] (the ability of a vessel to restore itself to an upright position after being inclined by wind, sea, or loading conditions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usna.edu/NAOE/academics/en342.php www.usna.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrodynamics===
[[Hydrodynamics]] concerns the flow of water around the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and [[stern]], and over bodies such as [[Boat Propeller|propeller]] blades or [[rudder]], or through thruster tunnels. 
[[Ship resistance and propulsion|Resistance]] – resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull. Powering calculation is done based on this.
[[Marine propulsion|Propulsion]] – to move the vessel through water using [[propellers]], thrusters, [[Pump-jet|water jets]], [[sail]]s etc. Engine types are mainly [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]]. Some vessels are electrically powered using [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear]] or [[solar energy]].
[[Ship motions]] – involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind.
Controllability (maneuvering) – involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel.

=== Flotation and stability ===
While atop a liquid surface a floating body has 6 degrees of freedom in its movements, these are categorized in either rotation or translation.
* Fore and aft translation is termed surge.
* Transverse translation is termed sway.
* Vertical translation is termed heave.
* Rotation about a transverse axis is termed trim or pitch.
* Rotation about a fore and aft axis is termed heel or roll.
* Rotation about a vertical axis is termed yaw.

Longitudinal stability for longitudinal inclinations, the stability depends upon the distance between the center of gravity and the longitudinal meta-center. In other words, the basis in which the ship maintains its center of gravity is its distance set equally apart from both the aft and forward section of the ship.

While a body floats on a liquid surface it still encounters the force of gravity pushing down on it. In order to stay afloat and avoid sinking there is an opposed force acting against the body known as the hydrostatic pressures. The forces acting on the body must be of the same magnitude and same line of motion in order to maintain the body at equilibrium. This description of equilibrium is only present when a freely floating body is in still water, when other conditions are present the magnitude of which these forces shifts drastically creating the swaying motion of the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Naval Architecture|last=Tupper|first=Eric|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the body, in other words, the mass of the body is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the body. This adds an upward force to the body by the amount of surface area times the area displaced in order to create an equilibrium between the surface of the body and the surface of the water.

The stability of a ship under most conditions is able to overcome any form or restriction or resistance encountered in rough seas; however, ships have undesirable roll characteristics when the balance of oscillations in roll is two times that of oscillations in heave, thus causing the ship to capsize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neves|first=M. A. S.|date=2016|title=Dynamic stability of ships in regular and irregular seas - An Overview|url=|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=120|pages=362–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structures===
[[Structural engineering|Structures]] involves selection of material of construction, [[structural analysis]] of global and local strength of the vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during [[Seakeeping|motions in seaway]]. Depending on the type of ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it. Some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship''',''' deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships such as the [[SS Great Eastern]], but later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them as the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arrangements===
Arrangements involves [[concept design]], layout and access, [[fire protection]], allocation of spaces, [[ergonomics]] and [[Tonnage|capacity]].

===Construction===
[[Shipbuilding|Construction]] depends on the material used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]], marking, [[Machining|cutting]] and [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] as per the [[structural design]] drawings or models, followed by erection and [[Ship launching|launching]]. [[Adhesive bonding|Other joining techniques]] are used for other materials like [[fibre reinforced plastic]] and [[glass-reinforced plastic]].The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When the strength of the structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered in the way that the ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prabowo|first=A. R.|date=2017|title=Effects of the rebounding of a striking ship on structural crashworthiness during ship-ship collision|url=|journal=Thin-Walled Structures|volume=115|pages=225–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and craft==
Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science.  The suitability of a vessel's shape was judged by looking at a half-model of a vessel or a prototype.  Ungainly shapes or abrupt transitions were frowned on as being flawed.  This included rigging, deck arrangements, and even fixtures.  Subjective descriptors such as ungainly, full, and fine were used as a substitute for the [[Hull (watercraft)|more precise terms]] used today.  A vessel was, and still is described as having a ‘fair’ shape.  The term ‘fair’ is meant to denote not only a smooth transition from fore to aft but also a shape that was ‘right.’  Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.

Modern low-cost digital [[computers]] and dedicated [[software]], combined with extensive research to correlate full-scale, [[towing tank]] and computational data, have enabled naval architects to more accurately predict the performance of a marine vehicle. These tools are used for [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|static stability]] (intact and damaged), dynamic stability, resistance, powering, hull development, [[structural analysis]], green water modelling, and slamming analysis. Data are regularly shared in international conferences sponsored by [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects|RINA]], [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers|Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)]] and others. [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] is being applied to predict the response of a floating body in a random sea.

==The naval architect==
[[File:Naval Architect at Work.JPG|thumb|Naval architect at work]]
Due to the complexity associated with operating in a marine environment, naval architecture is a co-operative effort between groups of technically skilled individuals who are specialists in particular fields, often coordinated by a lead naval architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html American Society of Naval Engineers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226035256/http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}. Naval engineering brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; This inherent complexity also means that the analytical tools available are much less evolved than those for designing aircraft, cars and even spacecraft.  This is due primarily to the paucity of data on the environment the marine vehicle is required to work in and the complexity of the interaction of waves and wind on a marine structure.

A naval architect is an [[engineer]] who is responsible for the design, construction, and/or repair of ships, boats, other marine vessels, and offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:

:* [[Merchant ship]]s – [[oil tanker]]s, [[LNG carrier|gas tankers]], [[cargo ship]]s, [[bulk carrier]]s, [[container ships]]
:* [[Ferry|Passenger/vehicle ferries]], [[cruise ship]]s
:* [[Warship]]s – [[frigate]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[aircraft carrier]]s, amphibious ships
:* [[Submarine]]s and underwater vehicles
:* [[Icebreaker]]s
:* [[High speed craft]] – [[hovercraft]], [[catamaran|multi-hull ships]], [[hydrofoil]] craft
:* Workboats – [[barge]]s, [[fishing boat]]s, [[anchor handling tug supply vessel]]s, [[platform supply vessel]]s, [[tug boat]]s, pilot vessels, rescue craft
:* [[Yacht]]s, power boats, and other recreational watercraft
:* [[Offshore platform]]s and [[Subsea#Oil and gas|subsea]] developments
[[File:Model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker, Florida .jpg|thumb|1/100 scale model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker. Florida]]
Some of these vessels are amongst the largest (such as [[supertankers]]), most complex (such as [[Aircraft carriers]]), and highly valued movable structures produced by mankind. They are typically the most efficient method of transporting the world's raw materials and products. Modern engineering on this scale is essentially a team activity conducted by specialists in their respective fields and disciplines. 
Naval architects integrate these activities. This demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability to bring together the often-conflicting demands of the various design constraints to produce a product which is fit for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Family Standard for Professional Work in the Engineering and Architecture Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, pp. 43–45 |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512122916/https://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this leadership role, a naval architect also has a specialist function in ensuring that a safe, economic, environmentally sound and [[seaworthy]] design is produced. To undertake all these tasks, a naval architect must have an understanding of many branches of engineering and must be in the forefront of high technology areas. He or she must be able to effectively utilize the services provided by scientists, lawyers, accountants, and business people of many kinds.

Naval architects typically work for [[shipyard]]s, ship owners, design firms and consultancies, equipment manufacturers, [[Classification society|Classification societies]], regulatory bodies ([[Admiralty law]]), [[Navy|navies]], and governments.

'''Ottonian Architecture''' is an architectural style which evolved during the reign of Emperor [[Otto the Great]]. The style was found in [[Germany]] and lasted from the mid 10th century until the mid 11th century.

Ottonian architecture draws its inspiration from [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]. Apart from some examples influenced by the octagonal [[Palatine Chapel at Aachen]] such as [[Ottmarsheim]] (11th century, Alsace) and the apse of the abbey of the Holy Trinity at Essen, religious architecture tends to diverge from the centralised plan. Inspiration though from the Roman [[basilica]] remains concurrent, and Ottonian architecture preserves the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] double ended feature with apses at either end of the church.

*[[St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], Belgium.
*[[Church of St. Gertrude]], [[Nivelles]], Belgium (1046)
*[[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|Church of St. Michael]], [[Hildesheim]], Germany (1010–33)
*[[Abbey Church of Gernrode]] (960–965, apparently the first in Europe to have a [[tribune (architecture)|tribune]] gallery)

'''Photovoice''' also known as '''picturevoice''' is a qualitative method used for [[community-based participatory research]] to document and reflect reality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://teamlab.usc.edu/files/2018/08/Photovoice-Literature-Review-FINAL-22ltfmn.pdf Darrah L Goo Kuratani &amp; Elaine Lai (2011).

Participants are asked to express their points of view or represent their communities by photographing scenes that highlight research themes. Common research themes include community concerns, community assets, social issues, and public health barriers.&lt;ref name=wang97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. C., Yi, W. K., Tao, Z. W., &amp; Carovano, K. (1998). Photovoice as a participatory health promotion strategy. Health promotion international, 13(1), 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt; These photographs are collaboratively interpreted through discussions in both small and large groups, and narratives can be developed that explain how the photos highlight a particular research theme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sih.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/seminar/pdf/2012/3.pdf|title=Chapter Nine: Using Photovoice as a Participatory Assessment and Issue Selection Tool |last=Wang |first=Caroline |date=2003 |website= |archive-url=http://www.sih.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/seminar/pdf/2012/3.pdf |archive-date=2003 |dead-url=|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These narratives are then used to promote dialogue to mobilize and help change-makers (i.e. policymakers) better understand and change the community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thereby developing effective solutions and programs that address the issues and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Catalani, C., &amp; Minkler, M. (2010). Photovoice: A review of the literature in health and public health. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 37(3), 424-451.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Photovoice was developed in 1992 by Caroline C. Wang of the [[University of Michigan]], and Mary Ann Burris, Program Officer for Women's Health at the Ford Foundation headquartered in Beijing, China. The idea was built on the foundation that images and words together can effectively express communities and individual's needs, problems, and desires.&lt;ref name="Nykiforuk 103–124"/&gt; In addition, the concept was strongly influenced by [[documentary photography]], the concept [[empowerment]], [[feminist theory]], [[Paulo Freire]]'s [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] to promote health education and his idea of [[critical consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, N., &amp; Bernstein, E. (1988). Empowerment Education: Freire's Ideas Adapted to Health Education. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 15(4), 379-394. {{doi|10.1177/109019818801500402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strack RW, Magill C., &amp; McDonagh, K.|first=|date=|title=Engaging youth through Photovoice|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/R_Strack_Engaging_2004.pdf|journal=Health Promotion Practice|volume=5|pages=49–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoice was first used to empower the silenced rural women in Yunnan Province, China to influence the policies and programs affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C., &amp; Burris, M. A. (1994). Empowerment through Photo Novella: Portraits of Participation. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 21(2), 171-186. {{doi|10.1177/109019819402100204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, the method has been used in different settings and populations, such as by refugees in San Diego seeking in–person medical interpretation options, by homeless adults in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], by Dr. Claudia Mitchell to support community health workers and teachers in rural [[South Africa]], and by Dr. Laura S. Lorenz of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in her work with brain injury survivors.&lt;ref name="photovoice with brain injury survivors"&gt;Lorenz, LS (2010) "Brain Injury Survivors: Narratives of Rehabilitation and Healing." Disability in Society, Ronald J. Berger, Series Editor. Boulder, CO and London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/R_Strack_Engaging_2004.pdf|title=Engaging Youth through Photovoice |last=Strack |first=Robert |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern implementation==
In the 21st century, some university professors have used the photovoice model to teach social work students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=08ef2abd-236a-4cf8-87b0-615ee0f10996%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=4101 | title=Using Photo Voice to Teach Social Issues With Undergraduate Social Work Students | author=Oden, Melissa | journal=Texas Public Health Journal |date=September 2013 | volume=65 | issue=4 | pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photovoice has also been used in conjunction with collaging, drawing, and mapping in participatory studies which focus on the voice of participants and aim to make the familiar strange.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Mannay, D. 2013. ‘Who put that on there... why why why?:’ Power games and participatory techniques of visual data production. Visual Studies, 28 (2), pp.136-146 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1472586X.2013.801635&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been used as a tool to engage children and youth, giving them a safe environment and opportunity to communicate their concerns and coping strategies to policymakers and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Skovdal, M. (2011) “Picturing the coping strategies of caregiving children in Western Kenya: from images to action.” American Journal of Public Health 101(3): 452-453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, photovoice is used at all levels as a tool for self-development, sharing awareness, advocacy, research, needs assessment, monitoring, etc. So the use of photovoice allows one to capture and widen their perspective on all levels of various issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Variants==
Also known as "participatory photography" or "photo novella", photovoice is considered a sub–type of "[[participatory art|participatory visual methods]]" or '''picturevoice''' which includes techniques such as photo-elicitation and digital storytelling. These techniques allow research participants to create visuals that capture their individual perspectives as part of the research process.&lt;ref name="sophe"&gt;"Picturevoice: Health Communication Through Art." Presentation. [[Society for Public Health Education]] 60th Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA. November 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="participatory visual methods"&gt;Lorenz, LS and B Kolb (2009). Involving the public through participatory visual research methods. Health Expectations, Volume 12, Issue 3, pp 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is found in [[Project Lives]], a participatory photography project used to create a new image of project housing dwellers, published in April 2015. Two other forms of picturevoice include '''paintvoice''', stemming from the work of Michael Yonas, and '''comicvoice''', which has been pioneered by John Baird's ''[[Create a Comic Project]]'' since 2008, and to a lesser extent by Michael Bitz's ''[[Comic Book Project]]''.&lt;ref name="apha"&gt;"Healthy Holidays: Lessons Learned from a Community Education Event." Presentation. [[American Public Health Association]] 137th Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA. November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA1"&gt;"Comicvoice: Community education through sequential art." Pop Culture Association - American Culture Association, St. Louis, MO. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==International development==
In international research, photovoice has been seen to allow participants from the developing world to define how they want to be represented to the international community. The individuals are facilitated and given control to tell their stories and perspectives which empower them to be engaged and maintain a firm sense of authorship over their representations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This helps to convey a stereotype-free picture of what it means to live in a [[developing country]] to those supporting (i.e. funders and voters of the [[developed country]]) and doing international development (i.e. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] and [[Government agency|government agencies]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Skovdal, M., Cornish, F., (2015) "Qualitative Research for Development: A guide for practitioners" Rugby, UK: Practical Action Publishing (Chapter 6 - Photovoice: Methodology and Use)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, photovoice allows the community to monitor the impact of the change created by development programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This can help inform the outside agency about the process, true impacts (what is/isn't working and why), and complex reality,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photovoice.org/matt-daw-participation-in-development/|title=PhotoVoice   » Participation in Development|website=photovoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus accompany wider and deeper research and analysis to improve the development progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photovoice.org/international-projects/|title=PhotoVoice   » International Projects|website=photovoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">A '''point of delivery''', or '''PoD''', is "a module of network, compute, storage, and application components that work together to deliver networking services. The PoD is a repeatable [[design pattern]], and its components maximize the modularity, scalability, and manageability of data centers." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps10110/data_sheet_c78-507093.html#wp9000106 Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders Data Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[modular design]] principle has been applied to telephone and data networks, for instance through a repeatable [[Node (networking)|node]] design describing the configuration of equipment housed in [[point of presence]] facilities. The term is similarly used in cable video networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablelabs.com/news/pr/2000/2000_01_18.html |title=CableLabs® Releases OpenCable™ POD Interface Copy Protection System Specification |publisher=CableLabs |date=January 18, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121015555/http://cablelabs.com/news/pr/2000/2000_01_18.html|archivedate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the modular component that delivers video service to a subscriber. The distinction of a PoD versus other [[design pattern]]s is that it is a [[System deployment|deployable]] [[Modular programming|module]] which delivers a [[Service (economics)|service]].

The PoD [[design pattern]] is especially important in [[service provider]] [[infrastructure]], for instance in [[Data center|datacenters]] supporting [[cloud computing]] [[Service (economics)|services]], in order to sustain [[scalability]] as usage grows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12686">{{Fats}}
'''Polyunsaturated fats''' are [[fat|fats]] in which the constituent [[hydrocarbon]] chain possesses two or more carbon–carbon [[double bond]]s.&lt;ref name="osu2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential Fatty Acids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=24 May 2017|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil, alpha-linolenic acid|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fish-oil/NS_patient-fishoil/|publisher=Mayo Clinic|date=2017|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyunsaturated fat can be found mostly in nuts, seeds, fish, seed oils, and [[oyster]]s.&lt;ref name=osu2014/&gt; "Unsaturated" refers to the fact that the molecules contain less than the maximum amount of hydrogen (if there were no double bonds). These materials exist as ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' or ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' [[Conformational isomerism|isomers]] depending on the geometry of the double bond.

[[Saturated fats]] have hydrocarbon chains which can be most readily aligned. The hydrocarbon chains in trans fats align more readily than those in cis fats, but less well than those in saturated fats. In general, this means that the melting points of fats increase from cis to trans unsaturated and then to saturated. See the section about the [[Fat#Chemical structure|chemical structure of fats]] for more information.

[[Image:Linoleic acid.png|thumb|300px|Chemical structure of the polyunsaturated fat [[linoleic acid]].]]
[[Image:Linoleic acid3D.png|thumb|300px|3D representation of [[linoleic acid]] in a bent [[Conformational isomerism|conformation]].]]
[[Image:ALAnumbering.svg|360px|right|thumb|Chemical structure of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega−3 fatty acid.]]

The position of the carbon-carbon double bonds in [[carboxylic acid]] chains in fats is designated by [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]].&lt;ref name=osu2014/&gt; The carbon atom closest to the [[carboxyl group]] is the ''alpha'' carbon, the next carbon is the ''beta'' carbon and so on. In fatty acids the carbon atom of the [[methyl group]] at the end of the hydrocarbon chain is called the ''omega'' carbon because ''omega'' is the last letter of the Greek alphabet. [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s have a double bond three carbons away from the methyl carbon, whereas [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s have a double bond six carbons away from the methyl carbon. The illustration below shows the omega-6 fatty acid, [[linoleic acid]].

While it is the ''nutritional'' aspects of polyunsaturated fats that are generally of greatest interest, these materials also have non-food applications. [[Drying oils]], which [[polymerize]] on exposure to [[oxygen]] to form solid films, are polyunsaturated fats. The most common ones are [[linseed oil|linseed (flax seed) oil]], [[tung oil]], [[poppyseed oil|poppy seed oil]], [[perilla oil]], and [[walnut oil]]. These oils are used to make [[paints]] and [[varnishes]].

==Health==

=== Potential benefits ===

In preliminary research, [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s in algal oil, fish oil, fish and seafood have been shown to lower the risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]].&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/|publisher=US National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health: Fact Sheet for Health Professionals|date=2 November 2016|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other preliminary research indicates that [[omega-6 fatty acids]] in [[sunflower oil]] and [[safflower oil]] may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=n6&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of dietary n-6 fatty acids in the prevention of cardiovascular disease |journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine |volume= 8|issue= |pages=S42–5 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17876199 |doi=10.2459/01.JCM.0000289275.72556.13 |last1=Willett |first1=Walter C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among omega-3 fatty acids, neither long-chain nor short-chain forms were consistently associated with breast cancer risk. High levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), however, the most abundant omega-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] in erythrocyte ([[red blood cell]]) membranes, were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Valeria Pala, Vittorio Krogh, Paola Muti, Véronique Chajès, Elio Riboli, Andrea Micheli, Mitra Saadatian, Sabina Sieri, Franco Berrino 1088"&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Erythrocyte membrane fatty acids and subsequent breast cancer: a prospective Italian study |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=93 |issue=14 |pages=1088–95 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11459870 |doi=10.1093/jnci/93.14.1088  |last1=Pala  |first1=V.  |last2=Krogh  |first2=V  |last3=Muti  |first3=P  |last4=Chajès  |first4=V  |last5=Riboli  |first5=E  |last6=Micheli  |first6=A  |last7=Saadatian  |first7=M  |last8=Sieri  |first8=S  |last9=Berrino  |first9=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] obtained through the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids is positively associated with cognitive and behavioral performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of Fish Oil on cognitive performance in older subjects |journal=Neurology |volume=71 |pages=430–38 |date=August 2008 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000324268.45138.86 |last1=Van De Rest |first1=O. |last2=Geleijnse |first2=J.

Dietary intake of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] is under preliminary research to assess the risk of developing [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (motor neurone disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E reduces the risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=367–71 |date=April 2007 |pmid=16648143 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2005.083378 |pmc=2077791  |last1=Veldink  |first1=J H  |last2=Kalmijn  |first2=S  |last3=Groeneveld  |first3=G-J  |last4=Wunderink  |first4=W  |last5=Koster  |first5=A  |last6=De Vries  |first6=J H M  |last7=Van Der Luyt  |first7=J  |last8=Wokke  |first8=J H J  |last9=Van Den Berg  |first9=L H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nutritional status and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Japan |journal=Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=300–4 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17852010 |doi=10.1080/17482960701472249 |last1=Okamoto |first1=Kazushi |last2=Kihira |first2=Tameko |last3=Kondo |first3=Tomoyoshi |last4=Kobashi |first4=Gen |last5=Washio |first5=Masakazu |last6=Sasaki |first6=Satoshi |last7=Yokoyama |first7=Tetsuji |last8=Miyake |first8=Yoshihiro |last9=Sakamoto |first9=Naomasa|last10=Inaba |first10=Yutaka |last11=Nagai |first11=Masaki |display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids as established by comparative studies shows an omega-6:omega-3 ratio under 4:1 may influence health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simopoulos|title=The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids|pmid=12442909|work=The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids|publisher=National Institutes of Health|doi=10.1016/S0753-3322(02)00253-6|volume=56|issue=8|date=October 2002|pages=365–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to conventional advice, an evaluation of evidence from 1966-1973 pertaining to the health impacts of replacing dietary [[saturated fat]] with linoleic acid found that participants in the group doing so had ''increased'' rates of death from all causes, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Use of dietary linoleic acid for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and death: evaluation of recovered data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study and updated meta-analysis |journal=BMJ Group |volume=346 |pages=e8707 |date=February 2013 |doi=10.1136/bmj.e8707  |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707  |last1=Ramsden  |first1=C  |last2=Zamora  |first2=D  |last3=Leelarthaepin  |first3=B  |last4=Majchrzak-Hong  |first4=S  |last5=Faurot  |first5=K  |last6=Suchindran  |first6=C  |last7=Ringel  |first7=A  |last8=Davis  |first8=J  |last9=Hibbeln  |first9=J |pmid=23386268 |pmc=4688426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this evaluation was disputed by many scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/04/13/diet-heart-ramsden-mce-bmj-comments/|title=Research Review: Old data on dietary fats in context with current recommendations: Comments on Ramsden et al. in the British Medical Journal|author=Interview: Walter Willett|publisher=TH Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston|date=2017|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it fueled debate over worldwide dietary advice to substitute polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4537707|year=2015|author1=Weylandt|first1=K.

=== Pregnancy ===
Polyunsaturated fat supplementation does not decrease the incidence of pregnancy-related disorders, such as [[hypertension]] or [[preeclampsia]], but may increase the length of [[gestation]] slightly and decreased the incidence of early premature births.&lt;ref name=osu2014/&gt;

Expert panels in the United States and Europe recommend that pregnant and lactating women consume higher amounts of polyunsaturated fats than the general population to enhance the DHA status of the fetus and newborn.&lt;ref name=osu2014/&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Results from [[observational study|observational clinical trials]] on polyunsaturated fat intake and cancer have been inconsistent and vary by numerous factors of cancer incidence, including gender and genetic risk.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt; Some studies have shown associations between higher intakes and/or blood levels of polyunsaturated fat omega-3s and a decreased risk of certain cancers, including [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[colorectal cancer]], while other studies found no associations with cancer risk.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=3021439|year=2010|author1=Patterson|first1=R.

'''''Private Practices: The Story of a Sex Surrogate''''' is a 1985 US [[documentary film]] directed by [[Kirby Dick]] about the interaction between a [[sex surrogate]] and her clients - Dick's first documentary film.

==Synopsis==
''Private Practices'' focuses on [[sex surrogate]] Maureen Sullivan and two of her clients. Kipper, a 25-year-old college student, has had little sexual experience with women and seeks help overcoming his shyness. John, a 45-year-old divorcee, believes that his sexual inadequacies are preventing him from finding a new partner. Sullivan works with these men in an attempt to improve their body image, relationship skills, and sexual satisfaction.

The film also shows how these patients interact with their friends, family members, and therapists. Many scenes focus on Sullivan, who discusses her history as a surrogate and describes her own relationship difficulties. In one scene, she and her brother confront their father about his abusive behavior and unwillingness to accept Maureen's career choice.

The filmmakers paid for the patients' therapy in exchange for permission to record their sessions. In order to preserve the therapeutic atmosphere, Dick only allowed a single camera operator to be in the room during each session, and he and the rest of the crew monitored the filming from a remote station in a different room.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Practices'' DVD commentary track&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the film crew does not directly interact with the subjects during therapy, and the subjects rarely comment on the presence of the filmmakers.

A postscript to the film states that John and Kipper have gone on to form more successful relationships, while Sullivan has started dating and reduced her number of patients.

==Reception==
''Private Practices'' won favorable reviews from critics. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s Edward Guthmann called it "an honest, courageous and sensitive study of human beings in their most vulnerable moments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Short description|Cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning}}

{{Reading}}

'''Reading''' is the complex [[cognitive process]] of decoding [[symbols]] to derive meaning. 

Success in this process is measured as ''[[reading comprehension]]''. Reading is a means for [[language acquisition]], communication, and sharing [[information]] and ideas. The symbols are typically visual ([[written]] or [[printing|printed]]) but may be tactile ([[Braille]]). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"&gt;De Certeau, Michel. "Reading as Poaching." ''The Practice of Everyday Life''. Trans. Steven F. Rendall. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of [[speech]]) and comprehension. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]].

Other types of reading are not speech based [[writing system]]s, such as music [[Musical notation|notation]] or [[pictograms]]. The common link is the interpretation of [[symbols]] to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of [[Braille]]).

==Overview==
[[File:03282012Casa hogar niñas tlahuac30.JPG|thumb|Volunteer reads to a girl at the [[Casa Hogar de las Niñas]] in [[Mexico City]]]]
Currently most reading is either of the printed word from ink or [[toner]] on paper, such as in a [[book]], [[magazine]], [[newspaper]], [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]], or [[notebook]], or of electronic displays, such as [[computer display]]s, [[television]], [[mobile phone]]s or [[e-reader]]s. [[Handwriting|Handwritten]] text may also be produced using a [[graphite]] [[pencil]] or a [[pen]].
Short texts may be written or [[paint]]ed on an object.

Often the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a [[traffic sign|traffic]] or street sign. A [[slogan]] may be painted on a wall. A text may also be produced by arranging stones of a different color in a wall or road. Short texts like these are sometimes referred to as environmental print.

Sometimes text or images are in [[relief]], with or without using a color contrast. Words or images can be carved in stone, wood, or metal; instructions can be printed in relief on the plastic housing of a [[home appliance]], or myriad other examples.

A requirement for reading is a good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between letters and background (depending on colors of letters and background, any pattern or image in the background, and [[lighting]]) and a suitable font size. In the case of a computer screen, it is important to see an entire line of text without [[scrolling]].

The field of visual word recognition studies how people read individual words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cornelissen PL, Kringelbach ML, Ellis AW, Whitney C, Holiday IE, Hansen PC |title=Activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in the first 200 ms of reading: evidence from magnetoencephalography (MEG) |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5359 |year=2009 |pmid=19396362 |pmc=2671164 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005359|editor1-last=Aleman|editor1-first=André|last2=Kringelbach |last3=Ellis |last4=Whitney |last5=Holliday |last6=Hansen |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.5359C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wheat KL, Cornelissen PL, Frost SJ, Hansen PC |title=During visual word recognition, phonology is accessed within 100 ms and may be mediated by a speech production code: evidence from magnetoencephalography |journal= Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=15 |pages=5229–33 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20392945 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4448-09.2010|pmc=3419470|last2=Cornelissen |last3=Frost |last4=Hansen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nation K |title=Form-meaning links in the development of visual word recognition |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This has revealed that reading is performed as a series of eye [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] with [[saccade]]s between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead pause on some words mentally while their eyes are moving. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The process of recording information to read later is [[writing]]. In the case of computer and [[microfiche]] storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.

Reading is typically an individual activity, though on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners. Reading aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension, is a form of [[intrapersonal communication]]: in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard SC, Coltheart M, Palethorpe S, Castles A |title=Nonword reading: comparing dual-route cascaded and connectionist dual-process models with human data |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1268–88 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22309087 |doi=10.1037/a0026703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed the [[dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud]], accordingly to which there were two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, that are involved in this case, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the [[pronunciation]] of a written stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=coltheart1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Curtis, Brent |author3=Atkins, Paul |author4= Haller, Micheal |title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1993|volume=100|issue=4|pages=589–608|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada J, Imai H, Ikebe Y |title=The use of the orthographic lexicon in reading kana words |journal=J Gen Psychol |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=311–23 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2213002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading to young children is a recommended way to instill language and expression, and to promote comprehension of text. [[Personalised books]] for children are recommended to improve engagement in reading by featuring the child themselves in the story.

Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late [[Middle Ages]], the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Manguel/Silent_Readers.html | title=THE SILENT READERS | website=Alberto Manguel, Chapter 2 of A History of Reading (New York; Viking, 1996) | accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading skills==
{{Main article|Learning to read}}
[[Literacy]] is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. [[Illiteracy]] is the inability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.
[[Dyslexia]] refers to a cognitive difficulty with reading and writing. It is defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=November 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|archive-date=July 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term dyslexia can refer to two disorders: [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]]&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400|last2=Tschierse |last3=Amunts |last4=Wilms |last5=Vossel |last6=Willmes |last7=Grabowska |last8=Huber }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185–91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umiltà |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anchoring&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading rate===
[[File:Reading speed by age.jpg|thumb|Average reading rate in ''words per minute'' (wpm) depending on age and measured with different tests in English, French and German]]
Many studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED523331.pdf|title=Reading Rate and Comprehension|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|date=August 2011|website=ERIC:ED523331}}&lt;/ref&gt;Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age,&lt;ref&gt;''Im Auge des Lesers, foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung: vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude''(2006), ppgs. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension test. The reading test by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais ("L'alouette", published in 1967) tested reading aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Carver, Ronald P. |title=Reading rate: a review of research and theory |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-162420-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the data from Taylor (English) and Landerl (German) are based on texts of increasing difficulty; other data were obtained when all age groups were reading the same text.

Rates of reading include reading for memorization (fewer than 100 [[words per minute]] [wpm]); reading for learning (100–200 wpm); reading for comprehension (200–400 wpm); and [[skimming (reading)|skimming]] (400–700 wpm). Reading for comprehension is the essence of the daily reading of most people. Skimming is for superficially processing large quantities of text at a low level of comprehension (below 50%).

Advice for choosing the appropriate reading-rate includes reading flexibly, slowing when concepts are closely presented and when the material is new, and increasing when the material is familiar and of thin concept. [[Speed reading]] courses and books often encourage the reader to continually accelerate; comprehension tests lead the reader to believe his or her comprehension is continually improving; yet, competence-in-reading requires knowing that skimming is dangerous, as a default [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method|date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading speed has been used as a measure in research to determine the effect of interventions on human vision.

Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Some argue that this competes with phonics and synthetic phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning to spell.

Other methods of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become somewhat controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Feitelson |first=Dina |title=Facts and Fads in Beginning Reading: A Cross-Language Perspective |year=1988 |publisher=Ablex |location=Norwood, New Jersey, United States |isbn=978-0-89391-507-0 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning to read in a second language, especially in adulthood, may be a different process than learning to read a native language in childhood.

The novelist [[Nicholas Delbanco]] taught himself to read at age six during a transatlantic crossing by studying a book about boats.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Brain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNorgan C, Alvarez A, Bhullar A, Gayda J, Booth JR |title=Prediction of reading skill several years later depends on age and brain region: implications for developmental models of reading |journal=[[The Journal of Neuroscience]] |volume=31 |issue=26 |pages=9641–8 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21715629 |pmc=3147303 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0334-11.2011 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21715629|last2=Alvarez |last3=Bhullar |last4=Gayda |last5=Booth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that can be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes:
* ''[[Subvocalization|Subvocalized]]'' reading combines sight reading with internal sounding of the words as if spoken. Advocates of speed reading claim it can be a bad habit that slows reading and comprehension, but other studies indicate the reverse, particularly with difficult texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moidel|first=Steve|title=Speed Reading for Business|publisher=Barron's Educational|location=Hauppauge, NY|pages=23–24|isbn=978-0-7641-0401-5|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rayner|first=Keith|others=Pollatsek, Alexander|title=The Psychology of Reading|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1995|pages=192–194|isbn=978-0-8058-1872-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Speed reading]]'' is a collection of methods for increasing reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. Methods include skimming or the [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]] of words in a body of text to increase the rate of reading. It is closely connected to [[speed learning]].
* ''[[Incremental reading]]'' is a software-assisted reading method designed for [[long-term memory|long-term memorization]]. "Incremental reading" means "reading in portions": in each session, parts of several electronic articles are read inside a prioritized reading list. In the course of reading, important pieces of information are extracted and converted into [[flashcard]]s, which are then reviewed by a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.
* ''[[Proofreading]]'' is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting [[typographical]] errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional proofreaders typically acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for some kinds of material than for others, while they may largely suspend comprehension while doing so, except when needed to select among several possible words that a suspected typographic error allows.
* ''Rereading'' is reading a book more than once. "One cannot read a book: one can only reread it," [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once said.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Meyer Spacks (2011). ''On Rereading'', [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-674-06222-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (Cristel Antonia (2012)) found re-reading offers mental health benefits because it allows for a more profound emotional connection and self-reflection, versus the first reading, which is more focused on the events and plot.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Waugh.

[[File:Bookandpencil.png|thumb|250px|mini|right|Many take notes while reading.]]
* ''Structure-proposition-evaluation (SPE)'' method, popularized by [[Mortimer Adler]] in ''[[How to Read a Book]]'', mainly for non-fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three passes: (1) for the structure of the work, which might be represented by an outline; (2) for the logical propositions made, organized into chains of inference; and (3) for evaluation of the merits of the arguments and conclusions. This method involves [[suspended judgment]] of the work or its arguments until they are fully understood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''Survey-question-read-recite-review ([[SQ3R]])'' method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading toward being able to teach what is read, and is appropriate for instructors preparing to teach material without referring to notes.
{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Multiple intelligences]]''-based methods, which draw on the reader's diverse ways of thinking and knowing to enrich appreciation of the text. Reading is fundamentally a linguistic activity: one can basically comprehend a text without resorting to other intelligences, such as the visual (e.g., mentally "seeing" characters or events described), auditory (e.g., reading aloud or mentally "hearing" sounds described), or even the logical intelligence (e.g., considering "what if" scenarios or predicting how the text will unfold based on context clues). However, most readers already use several kinds of intelligence while reading. Doing so in a more disciplined manner—i.e., constantly, or after every paragraph—can result in a more vivid, memorable experience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP)'' reading involves presenting the words in a sentence one word at a time at the same location on the display screen, at a specified eccentricity. RSVP eliminates inter-word saccades, limits intra-word saccades, and prevents reader control of fixation times (Legge, Mansfield, &amp; Chung, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Legge GE, Mansfield JS, Chung ST |title=Psychophysics of reading. XX.

Reading process is therefore a communication context.

==Assessment==

===Types of tests===
* Sight word reading: reading words of increasing difficulty until they become unable to read or understand the words presented to them. Difficulty is manipulated by using words that have more letters or syllables, are less common and have more complicated spelling–sound relationships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Nonword reading: reading lists of pronounceable nonsense words out loud. The difficulty is increased by using longer words, and also by using words with more complex spelling or sound sequences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k12academics.com/educational-psychology/reading-activity/reading-assessment#.WKHjtneZNo4|title=Reading Assessment - K12 Academics|first=Chris|last=Glavin|date=6 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reading comprehension: a passage is presented to the reader, which they must read either silently or out loud. Then a series of questions are presented that test the reader's comprehension of this passage.
* Reading fluency: the rate with which individuals can name words.
* Reading accuracy: the ability to correctly name a word on a page.

Some tests incorporate several of the above components at once. For instance, the [[Nelson-Denny Reading Test]] scores readers both on the speed with which they can read a passage, and also their ability to accurately answer questions about this passage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Recent research has questioned the validity of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, especially with regard to the identification of reading disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Coleman C, Lindstrom J, Nelson J, Lindstrom W, Gregg KN |title=Passageless comprehension on the Nelson-Denny reading test: well above chance for university students |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=244–9 |year=2010 |pmid=19933897 |doi=10.1177/0022219409345017|last2=Lindstrom |last3=Nelson |last4=Lindstrom |last5=Gregg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading books and writing are among brain-stimulating activities shown to slow down cognitive decline in old age, with people who participated in more mentally stimulating activities over their lifetimes having a slower rate of decline in memory and other mental capacities.&lt;ref name=Neurology20130703&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/07/being-a-lifelong-bookworm-may-keep-you-sharp-in-old-age/ |title=Being a Lifelong Bookworm May Keep You Sharp in Old Age |last=Koren |first=Marina |date=July 23, 2013 |website=Smithsonian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ht0xyPkH?url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/07/being-a-lifelong-bookworm-may-keep-you-sharp-in-old-age/ |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |access-date=July 5, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }} which cites {{Cite journal |url=http://neurology.org/content/early/2013/07/03/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |title= Life-span cognitive activity, neuropathologic burden, and cognitive aging|last=Wilson |first=Robert S. |date=July 3, 2013 |journal=Neurology |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=314–321 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ht0Ia2PN?url=http://neurology.org/content/early/2013/07/03/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |display-authors=etal |access-date=July 5, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |pmid=23825173 |pmc=3772831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading for pleasure has been linked to increased cognitive progress in vocabulary and mathematics during adolescence.

==Effects==
[[File:Nigth reading.JPG|thumb|Night reading has benefits to calm the nerves by eliminating excess sound and vision stimulus resulting in better sleep.]]

===Lighting===
Reading from paper and from some screens requires more [[lighting]] than many other activities. Therefore, the possibility of doing this comfortably in [[café]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[bus]]es, at [[bus stop]]s or in [[park]]s greatly varies depending on available lighting and time of day.

Reading from screens that produce their own light does not depend on external light, except that external light may lessen visual fatigue. For controlling what is on the screen ([[scrolling]], turning the page, etc.), a [[touch screen]] or [[Keyboard (computing)#Illumination|keyboard illumination]] further reduces dependency on external light.

==History==
[[File:Men reading the Koran in Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Syria.jpg|thumb|Men reading]]
The history of reading dates back to the [[History of writing|invention of writing]] during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading [[printing|print]] text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With [[Literacy#Ancient and medieval literacy|some exceptions]], only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered [[Literacy|literate]] before the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included [[classical Athens]] and the Islamic [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Delivering Education|author = Andrew J. Coulson|page = 117|publisher = [[Hoover Institution]]|url = http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817928928_105.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars assume that reading aloud (Latin ''clare legere'') was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (''legere tacite'' or ''legere sibi'') was unusual.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"&gt;Carruthers, Mary. 2008. ''The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture''. 2nd. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 212 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] remarks on [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]]'s unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jajdelska, Elspeth. 2007. ''Silent Reading and the Birth of the Narrator''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Reading has no concrete laws, but lets readers escape to produce their own products introspectively, promoting deep exploration of texts during interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society—and viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt; Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product. [[Michel de Certeau]] argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt;

In 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one—and as [[sleeping]] increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers—especially women—could escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mavrody|first1=Nika|title=The Dangers of Reading in Bed|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/reading-in-bed/527388/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''STAAD''' or ('''STAAD.Pro''') is a [[structural analysis]] and design software application originally developed by Research Engineers International in 1997. In late 2005, Research Engineers International was bought by [[Bentley Systems]].&lt;ref name="bentley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/STAAD.Pro/ |title=3D Structural Analysis and Design Software - STAAD.Pro |website=Bentley.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710184428/http://discussion.bentley.com/cgi-bin/dnewsweb.exe?cmd=article&amp;group=bentley.announcements&amp;item=448&amp;utag=] &lt;/ref&gt;

STAAD.Pro is one of the most widely used structural analysis and design [[software]] products worldwide. It supports over 90 international steel, concrete and timber design codes.

It can make use of various forms of analysis from the traditional static analysis, [[P-Delta Effect|p-delta]] analysis, geometric non-linear analysis, Pushover analysis(Static-Non Linear Analysis) or a [[buckling]] analysis. It can also make use of various forms of dynamic analysis from modal extraction to time history and response spectrum analysis.  

Additionally, STAAD.Pro is interoperabe with applications such as RAM Connection, AutoPIPE, SACS and many more engineering design and analysis applications to further improve collaboration between the different disciplines involved in a project. STAAD can be used for analysis and design of all types of structural projects from plants, buildings, and bridges to towers, tunnels, metro stations, water/wastewater treatment plants and more.

'''Satirical hip hop''' (also known as '''[[Internet meme|meme]] rap''')&lt;ref name="Know Your Meme"&gt;[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/satirical-hip-hop-meme-rap], [[Know Your Meme]]: "Satirical Hip Hop / Meme Rap".&lt;/ref&gt; is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] done in a [[sarcastic]], [[parodic]], or [[tongue in cheek]] way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snobsmusic.net/2011/01/kemo-treats-do-satirical-hip-hop-like.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1502506.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Satirical hip hop in many ways is a [[parody]] and a [[criticism]] of the whole genre of hip hop, but more specifically to subgenres like [[gangsta rap]], [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap rap]], and [[mumble rap]]. According to [[Know Your Meme]], the genre was created with the intent of becoming viral. Some common characteristics of satirical hip hop include [[lo-fi]] production, simplistic music videos, lazy rhymes, and intentionally stereotypical lyrics/topics.&lt;ref name="Know Your Meme" /&gt; Another major characteristic associated with meme rap is the use of [[Alter ego|alternate personas]], which is also a staple in comedy. Internet personality [[George Miller (entertainer)|George "Joji" Miller]] (better known as Filthy Frank), for example, occasionally performed under the alter ego "Pink Guy," a main character in his now-defunct ''Filthy Frank'' YouTube series. The character of Pink Guy is known for performing many absurdist [[comedy rap]] songs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==History and examples==

The earliest example of satirical hip hop can be traced back to the works of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who has made parody tracks of popular hip hop songs since the [[1990s (decade)|1990s]]. Another early example is with Southern California-based rapper [[Afroman]], with his two well-known tracks "[[Crazy Rap]]" and "[[Because I Got High]]," both released in 2001, featuring comedic lyrics.

In 2008, Odd Future members Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin released [[I Smell Panties#I Smell Panties EP|the sole EP]] under their short-lived comedy group name "I Smell Panties."&lt;ref&gt;[https://oddfuture.bandcamp.com/album/i-smell-panties], Bandcamp link for the "I Smell Panties" EP.&lt;/ref&gt; The duo utilized elements of gangsta rap and [[Southern hip hop]] in a satirical way when performing as I Smell Panties. Tyler then released a track in 2011 called "Come Through Looking Clean", a joke song performed under a character named "Young Nigga." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rap-up.com/2011/09/23/odd-future-drops-debut-single-from-new-artist-young-nigga/], Rap-Up.&lt;/ref&gt; It's a parody of the "Bling Era" of hip hop that was popular during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] and draws heavy inspiration from the music of [[Lil B]]. The Young Nigga character would later be re-used on various skits in the 2012 [[Adult Swim]] program [[Loiter Squad]], which was created by and starred members of Odd Future. In February 2016, Tyler revealed that his 2011 breakout viral single "[[Yonkers (song)|Yonkers]]" was made as a joke song attempting to parody the style of [[East Coast hip hop|New York rappers]] (hence the title of "Yonkers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyler, the Creator: "Yonkers" Was Made As a Joke|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/63619-tyler-the-creator-yonkers-was-made-as-a-joke/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan-based Internet celebrity and rapper [[Rucka Rucka Ali]] became famous in the late 2000s/early 2010s for creating pop song parodies (including parodies of popular hip hop songs) containing lyrics for [[shock value]]. He often includes juvenile references to [[ethnic stereotypes]], topical subject matter, and [[Black comedy|dark humor]]. His music also tends to make use of comedic portrayals of celebrities in the same vein to the animated comedy series ''[[South Park]]'', and his several alter egos espouses stereotypical qualities of specific ethnic groups; his alter egos include DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish), and Toby Queef (White-American [[redneck]]). Some critics have labeled Ali as a [[racist]] as a reaction to his songs, although his humor seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''South Park'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', and has jokingly defended his brand of humor by claiming that he's "stating objective facts" when he references stereotypes in his songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ruckasworld.com/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; His videos and [[YouTube]] channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17 YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations&lt;ref&gt;http://ruckasworld.com/&lt;/ref&gt;), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]].

In the mid-2010s, Ryan Harryman, a [[San Jose State University]] student and member of [[San Jose State Spartans|the school's water polo club team]],&lt;ref name="The Mercury News"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Jose State student dies several days after water polo practice at campus pool|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/10/18/san-jose-state-student-dies-several-days-after-water-polo-practice-at-campus-pool/|website=The Mercury News|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a viral sensation on the Internet under the stage name "3PAC."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuwE5TDU8ANzIvqqSZcgUig], YouTube: 3PACTVHD.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his self-produced music videos, bombastic and aggressive comedic rap songs, and [[diss tracks]] targeting mainstream rappers like [[Eminem]] and [[2 Chainz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/3pac], [[Know Your Meme]] page on 3PAC.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as YouTube gaming channel [[PewDiePie]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/3pac-pewdiepie-is-a-child-rapist-song-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "PewDiePie is a Child Rapist" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; 3PAC made a guest appearance on ''[[The New CALassic]]'', a comedy hip hop mixtape performed by Internet music critic [[The Needle Drop|Anthony Fantano]] (under his "Cal Chuchesta" alter ego) that was released in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theneedledrop.com/articles/2015/8/cal-chuchesta-the-new-calassic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=3Pac: To Live and Die on 4chan|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/3pac-ryan-harryman-profile-death-rapper|website=Spin Magazine|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harryman died at the age of 24 in October 2015 after suffering severe brain damage during a water polo practice.&lt;ref name="The Mercury News" /&gt;

The seventh track of underground rapper [[Hopsin]]'s 2015 album ''[[Pound Syndrome]]'', entitled "No Words", is a skit meant to both satirize and criticize the trend of [[mumble rap]] that was popular during that time, calling rappers (specifically to artists like [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Young Thug]], and [[Migos]]) who are a part of that subgenre "[[Intellectual disability|mentally retarded]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Hopsin-no-words-skit-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "No Words" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; and also mocking fans of mumble rap.

In 2017, [[YouTube]] personality [[George Miller (entertainer)|Filthy Frank]] released a music project titled ''[[Pink Season (Pink Guy album)|Pink Season]]'', the second album performed under the name "Pink Guy", with some songs poking fun at hip hop music as a whole, among other things. The track "Hand On My Gat" for example, features a character named PolitikZ that acts as a caricature for [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] [[Underground hip hop|underground rappers]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Pink-guy-hand-on-my-gat-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "Hand On My Gat" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; that character's previous appearance was on the Filthy Frank video "BAD INTERNET RAPPERS" (uploaded in November 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6iefP8lf3o], YouTube: "BAD INTERNET RAPPERS" by TVFilthyFrank.&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed a song called "Real Hip Hop" that directly parodied the stereotypical anti-mainstream and [[Political hip hop|politically charged]] attitudes of underground rappers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Politikz-real-hip-hop-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "REAL HIP HOP" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHYwprmWMfY], YouTube: "PolitikZ - 'REAL HIP HOP'" by TooDamnFilthy.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pink Season'' album reached number one on the [[iTunes]] charts and peaked at 70 on the [[Billboard 200]].&lt;ref name="Billboard 200"&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard 200|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2017-01-28|website=Billboard|access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, nearly a month after the retirement of the "Filthy Frank" project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pigeonsandplanes.com/news/2017/12/joji-quits-pink-guy-filthy-frank-comedy], [[Pigeons and Planes]]: "Joji Explains Decision to Quit Filthy Frank and Pink Guy as He Pursues Music Career."&lt;/ref&gt; George Miller returned to performing as Pink Guy to co-star in a music video made by Lil Toenail, a Florida-based meme rapper who performs with a giant foot costume and ski mask to maintain his anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpjwhH4Joio], YouTube: "Lil Toenail - Go Out (Official Music Video)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Internet personality and music critic [[The Needle Drop|Anthony Fantano]] began releasing more satirical hip hop tracks under his Cal Chuchesta alter ego, releasing the tracks "Coin Star"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B2NEVbP20&lt;/ref&gt; and "Don't Talk To Me."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWi01SBfmw&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sign system''' is a key concept in [[semiotics]] and is used to refer to any system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and relations between signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beynon-Davies P.|year=2010|title=Dances with bees: exploring the relevance of the study of animal communication to informatics|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|number=1|pages=185–198|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[language]]'' is frequently used as a synonym for a sign-system. However, the term ''sign-system'' is preferable to the term ''language'' for a number of reasons. First, the use of the term ''language'' tends to carry with it [[connotation]]s of human language, particularly human spoken language. Human spoken language is only one example of a sign-system; albeit probably one of the most complex sign-systems known.

For example, in traditional forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through [[non-verbal communication|non-verbal]] as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this can be referred to as [[body language]]. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of  communication forms such as [[animal communication]] and [[Man-machine interface|man-machine communication]]. Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of [[communication]] and in particular can help to provide tentative answers to the question of the nature and function of communication.

The '''Simulated Fluorescence Process''' (SFP) is a computing algorithm used for [[scientific visualization]] of 3D data from, for example, [[fluorescence microscope]]s. By modeling a physical light/matter interaction process an image is computed showing the data as it would have appeared in reality when viewed under these conditions.

==Principle==

The algorithm considers a virtual light source producing excitation light that illuminates the object. This casts shadows either on parts of the object itself or on other objects below it. The interaction between the excitation light and the object provokes the emission light, that also interacts with the object before it finally reaches the eye of the viewer.

[[Image:Cubic Zirconia Run Opening.jpg|thumb|Cubic zirconia "run" being opened]]
The '''skull crucible''' process was developed at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] in [[Moscow]] to manufacture [[cubic zirconia]]. It was invented to solve the problem of cubic zirconia's melting-point being too high for even platinum [[crucible]]s. 

In essence, by heating only the center of a volume of cubic zirconia, the material forms its own "crucible" from its cooler outer layers. The term "skull" refers to these outer layers forming a shell enclosing the molten volume. [[Zirconium oxide]] powder is heated then gradually allowed to cool. Heating is accomplished by [[radio frequency induction]] using a coil wrapped around the apparatus.  The outside of the device is [[Water jacket|water-cooled]] in order to keep the RF coil from melting and also to cool the outside of the zirconium oxide and thus maintain the shape of the zirconium powder.
 
Since zirconium oxide in its solid state [[Insulator (electrical)|does not conduct]] electricity, a piece of [[zirconium]] metal is placed inside the gob of zirconium oxide. As the zirconium melts it oxidizes and blends with the now molten zirconium oxide, a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], and is heated by RF induction.

When the zirconium oxide is melted on the inside (but not completely, since the outside needs to remain solid) the amplitude of the RF induction coil is gradually reduced and [[crystal]]s form as the material cools. Normally this would form a [[monoclinic crystal system]] of zirconium oxide. 

In order to maintain a [[cubic crystal system]] a stabilizer is added, [[magnesium oxide]], [[calcium oxide]] or [[yttrium oxide]] as well as any material to color the crystal. After the mixture cools the outer shell is broken off and the interior of the gob is then used to manufacture [[gemstone]]s.

'''Sky islands''' are isolated mountains surrounded by radically different lowland environments. The term originally referred to those found near the southern borders of Arizona and New Mexico, and has extended to similarly isolated high-altitude forests. The isolation has significant implications for these natural habitats. The [[American Southwest]] region began warming up between ∼20,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years BP and atmospheric temperatures increased substantially, resulting in the formation of vast deserts that isolated the Sky Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Favé |first=M., Johnson |date=2015 |title=Past climate change on Sky Islands drives novelty in a core developmental gene network and its phenotype |url=http://fh6xn3yd3x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Past+climate+change+on+Sky+Islands+drives+novelty+in+a+core+developmental+gene+network+and+its+phenotype&amp;rft.jtitle=BMC+evolutionary+biology&amp;rft.au=Fav%C3%A9%2C+Marie-Julie&amp;rft.au=Johnson%2C+Robert+A&amp;rft.au=Cover%2C+Stefan&amp;rft.au=Handschuh%2C+Stephan&amp;rft.date=2015&amp;rft.eissn=1471-2148&amp;rft.volume=15&amp;rft.spage=183&amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F26338531&amp;rft.externalDocID=26338531&amp;paramdict=en-US |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=15 |page=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Endemism]], [[altitudinal migration]], and [[relict]] populations are some of the natural phenomena to be found on sky islands.

The complex dynamics of [[species richness]] on sky islands draws attention from the discipline of [[biogeography]], and likewise the [[biodiversity]] is of concern to [[conservation biology]]. One of the key elements of a sky island is separation by physical distance from the other mountain ranges, resulting in a habitat island, such as a forest surrounded by desert.

Some sky islands serve as [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for boreal species stranded by warming climates since the [[last glacial period]]. In other cases, localized populations of plants and animals tend towards [[speciation]], similar to oceanic islands such as the [[Galápagos Islands]] of [[Ecuador]].

==Origin of the term==
The sky island concept originated in 1943 when Natt N. Dodge, in an article in ''Arizona Highways'' magazine, referred to the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] in southeastern Arizona as a "mountain island in a desert sea".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In about the same era, the term was used to refer to high alpine, unglaciated, ancient topographic landform surfaces on the crest of the Sierra Nevada, California. 
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularized by nature writer Weldon Heald, a resident of southeastern Arizona. In his 1967 book, ''Sky Island'', he demonstrated the concept by describing a drive from the town of [[Rodeo, New Mexico]], in the western [[Chihuahuan desert]], to a peak in the Chiricahua Mountains, {{convert|35|miles|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} away and {{convert|5600|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} higher in elevation. Ascending from the hot, arid desert, to grasslands, then to oak-pine woodland, pine forest, and finally to spruce-fir-aspen forest. His book mentions the concept of [[biome]], but prefers the terminology of [[life zone]]s, and makes reference to the work of [[Clinton Hart Merriam]]. The book also describes the wildlife and living conditions of the Chiricahuas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | publisher = [[Van Nostrand]]
  | year = 1967
  | location =  Princeton, New Jersey
  | pages = 114–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, the idea of mountains as islands of habitat took hold with scientists and has been used by such popular writers as [[David Quammen]]&lt;ref name = "Quammen"&gt;{{Cite book

==Characteristics==
The [[Madrean sky islands]] are probably the most studied sky islands in the world. Found in the U.S. states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] and the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], these numerous mountains form links in a chain connecting the northern end of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and the southern [[Colorado Plateau]]. Sky Islands of the central and northern mountains in the United States are often called [[island range]]s, especially by populations within view of such islands of mountains surrounded by plains such as those found within the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[southwestern Oklahoma]].

Some more northerly examples are the [[Crazy Mountains]], [[Castle Mountains (Montana)|Castle Mountains]], [[Bears Paw Mountains]], [[Highwood Mountains]], and [[Little Rocky Mountains]], all in the US state of [[Montana]].  Each of these ranges is forested and has tundra and snowpack above treeline, but is not connected to any other range by forested ridges; the ranges are completely surrounded by treeless prairie and/or semi-arid scrubland below.  Other well-known sky islands of North America are the [[Great Basin]] montane forests, such as the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] in California, and the [[Spring Mountains]] near Las Vegas, [[Nevada]]. One of the unique aspects of the sky islands of the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] region is the mix of floristic affinities, that is, the trees and plants of higher elevations are more characteristic of northern latitudes, while the flora of the lower elevations has ties to the desert and the mountains further south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some montane species apparently evolved within their current range, adapting to their local environment, such as the [[Mount Lyell shrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

These bears historically made use of the forests and meadows found in the Madrean sky islands, as well as lower-elevation habitats such as [[riparian zone]]s. (Grizzlies were extirpated from the region in the 20th century.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Confusing the matter somewhat is the potential for an archipelago of sky islands or even the valleys between them to act not only as a barrier to [[biological dispersal]], but also as a path for migration. Examples of birds and mammals making use of the Madrean archipelago to extend their ranges northward are the [[elegant trogon]] and [[white-nosed coati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13014">'''Social physics''' or '''sociophysics''' is a field of science which uses mathematical tools inspired by [[physics]] to understand the behavior of human crowds. In a modern commercial use, it can also refer to the analysis of social phenomena with [[big data]].

Social physics is closely related to [[econophysics]] which uses physics methods to describe [[economics]].

==History==
The first elements of social physics were outlined in French social thinker [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]]’s first book, the 1803 ''Lettres d’un Habitant de Geneve'', which described the idea of describing society using laws similar to those of the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iggers|first=Georg G.|year=1959|title=Further Remarks about Early Uses of the Term "Social Science"|jstor=2708121|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=20|issue=3|pages=433–436|doi=10.2307/2708121}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student and collaborator was [[Auguste Comte]], a French philosopher widely regarded as the founder of [[sociology]], who first defined the term in an essay appearing in ''Le Producteur'', a journal project by Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Comte defined social physics as&lt;blockquote&gt;Social physics is that science which occupies itself with social phenomena, considered in the same light as astronomical, physical, chemical, and physiological phenomena, that is to say as being subject to natural and invariable laws, the discovery of which is the special object of its researches. &lt;/blockquote&gt;After Saint-Simon and Comte, Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]], proposed that society be modeled using [[mathematical probability]] and [[social statistics]]. Quetelet's 1835 book, ''Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties'', outlines the project of a social physics characterized by measured variables that follow a [[normal distribution]], and collected data about many such variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sur+l%27homme+et+le+d%C3%A9veloppement+de+ses+facult%C3%A9s,+ou+Essai+de+physique+sociale&amp;ei=gAuuS_OPJZ7WMO2TvZcM&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Sur l'homme et le Développement de ses Facultés, ou Essai de Physique Sociale|last=Quetelet|first=Adolphe|publisher=Imprimeur-Libraire|year=1835|isbn=|volume=1-2|location=Paris|pages=|language=French|trans-title=Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently repeated anecdote is that when Comte discovered that Quetelet had appropriated the term 'social physics', he found it necessary to invent a new term 'sociologie' (sociology) because he disagreed with Quetelet's collection of statistics.

There have been several “generations” of social physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=Arthur|year=1984|orig-year=Presented at Annual Conference of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC), Syracuse, May 1980|title=Contributions to a Physical Science for the Study of Civilizations|journal=Journal of Social and Biological Structures|volume=7|issue=3|pages=259–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation began with Saint-Simon, Comte, and Quetelet, and ended with the late 1800s with historian [[Henry Adams]]. In the middle of the 20th century, researchers such as the American astrophysicist [[John Q. Stewart]] and Swedish geographer [[Reino Ajo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contributions to "Social Physics": a Programme Sketch with Special Regard to National Planning|last=Ajo|first=Reino|publisher=Royal University of Lund|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the spatial distribution of social interactions could be described using gravity models. Physicists such as [[Arthur Iberall]] use a [[homeokinetics]] approach to study social systems as complex self-organizing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=A|year=1985|title=Outlining social physics for modern societies - locating culture, economics, and politics: The Enlightenment reconsidered|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=82|pages=5582–84|doi=10.1073/pnas.82.17.5582|pmc=390594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iberall|first1=A|last2=Hassler|first2=F|last3=Soodak|first3=H|last4=Wilkinson|first4=D|year=2000|title=Invitation to an Enterprise: From Physics to World History to Civilizations’ Study|journal=Comparative Civilization Review|volume=42|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a homeokinetics analysis of society shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Iberall| first=Arthur S.|title=Homeokinetics: The Basics|publisher=Strong Voices Publishing|year=2016|location=Medfield, MA|isbn=978-0-990-53614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been a large number of social science papers that use mathematics broadly similar to that of [[physics]], and described as “[[computational social science]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, D., Pentland, A., et al ''Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s, Adams separated “human physics” into the subsets of social physics or social mechanics (sociology of interactions using physics-like mathematical tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|year=2002|orig-year=A talk presented at ‘Horizons in Complex Systems’ Messina, Sicily, Italy, 2001|title=The physical modelling of society: a historical perspective|url=http://www.if.ufrj.br/~mbr/econofisica/intro/artigos/Physica.A.314.1.2002.pdf|journal=Physica A|volume=314|issue=1-4|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/s0378-4371(02)01042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social thermodynamics or sociophysics, (sociology described using mathematical invariances similar to those in [[thermodynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Alan|title=Notes on Some Concepts in Social Physics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x/abstract|journal=Regional Science|publisher=Regional Science Association International|volume=22|issue=1|pages=159–193|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy is roughly analogous to the difference between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].

==Recent work==
In modern use “social physics” refers to using “[[big data]]” analysis and the mathematical laws to understand the behavior of human crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GEORGE|first=Gerard|last2=HAAS|first2=Martine R.|last3=PENTLAND|first3=Alex|year=2014|title=Big Data and Management: From the Editors|url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/4621/|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=57|issue=2|pages=321–326|doi=10.5465/amj.2014.4002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea is that data about human activity (e.g., phone call records, credit card purchases, taxi rides, web activity) contain mathematical patterns that are characteristic of how social interactions spread and converge. These mathematical invariances can then serve as a filter for analysis of behavior changes and for detecting emerging behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/predictive-analytics/|title=Predictive Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blockchain, Cryptography, and Social Physics Applications==
Over the past few years, Social Physics has been shown to be a potent analytics tool for a variety of applications where either data is anonymized or only metadata is available, as is typical of crytographic and [[blockchain]] systems. This is because Social Physics is primarily about interactions between elements, so that the form of the data is often irrelevant.  

Following are a few examples for the use of Social Physics applied to Blockchain and Crypto systems:
* Social Physics for Financial Interaction. In a recent MIT PhD [http://people.csail.mit.edu/pkrafft/papers/krafft-thesis-final.pdf Thesis], a social physics approach to [[cryptocurrency]] market buy/sell timing was shown to drive “bubbles” in [[AltCoin|AltCoins]]. In this experiment, carefully timed investments totaling just a few dollars often drove more than 5000 times increase in AltCoin market value.
* Social Physics for breaking cryptographic anonymization. A recent ruling of the US Supreme Court cited the use of Social Physics for the efficient re-identification of cryptographically anonymized metadata (similar to [[Bitcoin]] transactions), discouraging defense agencies and private companies from collecting and using this so-called "anonymized" data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre de|last2=Radaelli|first2=Laura|last3=Singh|first3=Vivek Kumar|last4=Pentland|first4=Alex “Sandy”|date=2015-01-30|title=Unique in the shopping mall: On the reidentifiability of credit card metadata|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/536|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6221|pages=536–539|doi=10.1126/science.1256297|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25635097}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Social Physics for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Social Physics was used to uncover a collaborating network of bitcoin addresses, an arrangement often used to launder stolen Bitcoins. This was done using a handful of known malicious addresses, that were used as “seeds” for the Social Physics “behavioral similarity detection” algorithm, resulting in an accurate detection of dozens of additional members of the network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1003255394|title=New solutions for cybersecurity|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Shrobe, Howard E.,, Shrier, David L.,, Pentland, Alex, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780262535373|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|chapter=11|oclc=1003255394}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commercial use==


Most recently, research by [[Alex Pentland|Prof. Alex “Sandy” Pentland]] and [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Yaniv Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has combined social physics with [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] to improve the performance of machine learning applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/tuning-social-networks-gain-wisdom-crowd|title=Tuning Social Networks to Gain the Wisdom of the Crowd {{!}} MIT Media Lab|website=www.media.mit.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.endor.com Endor], a company co-founded by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr. Altshuler]], utilized social physics to introduce a predictive intelligence platform that automates the process of answering predictive business questions, using natural language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/endor-inventing-google-predictive-analytics-1220|title=Inventing the “Google” for predictive analytics|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A ICO of 50 million USD was also conducted by Endor.

In the field of [[cyber-security]], a team headed by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has shown how the concept of social physics, manifested as mathematical invariances that are embedded in large datasets, can be used in order to generate new and highly efficient types of attacks on behavioral information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altshuler|first=Yaniv|last2=Aharony|first2=Nadav|last3=Pentland|first3=Alex|last4=Elovici|first4=Yuval|last5=Cebrian|first5=Manuel|year=2011|title=Stealing Reality: When Criminals Become Data Scientists (or Vice Versa)|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~yanival/IEEE_Intelligent_Systems.pdf|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=26|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of gender''' is a prominent subfield of [[sociology]]. Social interaction directly correlated with sociology regarding social structure. One of the most important social structures is [[Social status|status]]. This is determined based on position that an individual possesses which effects how he/she will be treated by society. One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjjbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender+roles+in+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20roles%20in%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda L.|date=2015-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317348085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term ''[[gender]]'' for the perceived or projected ([[Gender identity|self-identified]]) [[masculinity]] or [[femininity]] of a person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Introduction==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The term ''gender role'' was coined by [[John Money]] in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= |pmid=13260820 |quote=By the term, gender role, we mean all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism. Gender role is appraised in relation to the following: general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor, play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams, and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to [[biological sex]]. Societies tend to have [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[gender systems]] in which everyone is categorized as [[male]] or [[female]]. Some societies include a [[third gender]] role; for instance, the Native American [[Two-Spirit]] people and the [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]s of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a [[social construct]] or a [[Sex differences in humans|biological construct .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0465077144|location=New York|pages=|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In feminist theory==
{{Main|Feminist theory|Feminist sociology}}

During the 1970s, there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and  "learned sex roles", but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed. By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted traits.

Liberal feminism is the belief that individuals should be free to develop their own talents and pursue their interests. Individuals seek to expand equality by removing the barriers in society. Socialist feminism thinks that capitalism strengthens patriarchy by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few. The traditional family structure should be replaced by a collective revolution. In Radical feminism, they believe that patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society that even a sociological revolution would not end it; Society must eliminate gender itself.

==Other languages==
In English, both ''sex'' and ''gender'' are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like [[German language|German]], use the same word ''Geschlecht'' to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'' advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word ''gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes 'Geschlechtsidentität' is used as gender (although it literally means ''gender identity'') and 'Geschlecht' as sex (translation of [[Judith Butler]]'s ''[[Gender Trouble]]''). More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for ''sex'', ''Geschlechtsidentität'' for ''gender identity'' and ''Geschlechterrolle'' for ''gender role'' etc.

==U.S. media==

Media criticism is a reflection of the gender inequality in society through print, advertisements, television and music.  Media influences and reinforces the idea of [[The Beauty Myth]] as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book, The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which refers to unrealistic standards of beauty for women.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth: how images of beauty are used against women. N.p.: Perennial, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the mainstream media perpetuates the idea of hetero-masculinity by portraying men as dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael. Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men . New York : HarperCollins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that the media objectifies and oppresses women, and men who don't fall into the heteronormative category.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, S. (1999).

=== Oppression ===

Through the media, men are taught to be ultra-masculine by being desensitized, violent, and physically strong.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. (2002) 8 Reasons Why Eminem's Popularity is a Disaster for Women.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of media that often portray the ultra-masculine figure are advertisements, specifically beer commercials.  These forms encourage men to oppress other men if they do not fit the ideals of heteromasculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, L. (2004) "Beer Commercials: A manual for masculinity" in Kimmel, M. S., &amp; Messner (Eds.), M. A. Men's Lives (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 533-543.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification of women ===
{{See also|Sexualisation}}

Objectification of women refers to instances in the media in which women may be viewed as, or directly compared to, insentient objects that can be acquired and/or possessed. This can be examined in the context of advertisements, where objects may be anthropomorphized and given feminine qualities or aspects of the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objectify.|title=Definition of OBJECTIFY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies indicate that widespread objectification of women in the media may have significant repercussions on society, such as low self-esteem and/or eating disorders among women.&lt;ref&gt;Greening, Kacey D. "The Objectification and Dismemberment of Women in the Media." Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences (2004): n. pag. URC.

==Gender and socialization==
{{See also|Socialization#Gender socialization}}
Socialization theory offers a straightforward account of the acquisition of gendered identities. Infants are seen as blank slates, waiting to be written down on by their environment. Through their interactions with people close to them and exposure to the values of their society, infants learn what sex is attributed to them and what roles they are expected to learn. Reinforcement (through rewarding gender-appropriate behavior and punishing what may seem as deviant behavior) socializes children into their genders.&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Play: Girls and Boys in School|author=Thorne, Barrie|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8135-1923-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, for example, are far more likely to engage with their sons in rough physical play than they are with their daughters, and it has been argued that long-term consequences may follow (in this case, a head start for boys in the development of physical violence and aggressiveness.)&lt;ref&gt;Mcdonald, K. and R.D. Park (1986). Parent-child physical play, Sex Roles, Vol.15, pp.367-378&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents and family can influence the way that a child develops their view of gender. These types of influences can include parental attitudes and difference of treatment regarding male and female children. Researcher Susan Witt claims that parents also expose children to gender from the time they are born via specific toys, colors, and names associated with genders in the binary. Witt suggests that parental attitudes about gender can differ from male to female children and that these attitudes develop quickly after a child's birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt|first1=Susan|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|journal=Adolesncence|date=Summer 1997|volume=32|issue=126|pages=253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Susan Grieshaber, in "Constructing the Gendered Infant", suggests that attitudes regarding pregnancy change after parents find out the sex of their child, subsequently changing parental attitudes towards the unborn child. According to Grieshaber's theory, once parents determine the sex of their unborn child, they assume a gender while planning for the child's arrival. Because of this, Grieshaber claims that infants are born into a gendered world where they never know anything other than the gender traits that are assumed due to their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Early Childhood|last=Yelland|first=Nicola|last2=Grieshaber|first2=Susan|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=0-415-15409-X|location=New York, New York|pages=15–35|chapter=Constructing the Gendered Infant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kara Smith utilizes similar theory throughout the analysis of her pregnancy journals kept throughout her second pregnancy. Smith concluded that her attitude towards her child changed after learning that her child’s sex was male. Smith's claim is reflected in changes in tone of voice when talking to the unborn child as well as differences in physical touch of her stomach throughout the rest of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kara|date=2005|title=Prebirth Gender Talk: A Case Study in Prenatal Socialization|url=|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|pages=49–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory of gender socialization, discussed by Susan McHale, is that the gender roles and attitudes of older siblings can impact the gender roles adopted by younger children. Throughout the findings of McHale's study, it is maintained that parents still have the most familial influence on childhood socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McHale|first=Susan|date=2001|title=Sibling Influences on Gender Development in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/H_Helms_Sibling_2001.pdf|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=37|pages=115–125|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.1.115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time children reach the age of three, many will have acquired a firm sense of themselves as male or female, a gender identity that remains throughout life. In addition, many pre-schoolers develop a firm awareness of [[gender stereotypes]], insisting that certain activities or items of clothing are not for girls and others not for boys. Yet gender identity does not automatically follow from biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=2000|title=The Five Sexes, Revisited|url=|journal=The Sciences|volume=40|issue=4|pages=18–23|via=|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03504.x|pmid=12569934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-300-06497-1|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults respond differently to communicative efforts of boys and girls. A study of infants aged 13 months found that when boys demand attention - by behaving aggressively, or crying, whining or screaming - they tended to get it. By contrast, adults tended to respond to girls only when they used language, gestures, or gentle touches; girls who used attention-seeking techniques were likely ignored. There was little difference in the communicative patterns at the start of the study, but by the age of two, the girls have become more talkative and boys more assertive in their communicative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = B.I | year = 1985 | title = Differential reactions to assertive and communicative acts by toddler boys and girls | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1499–505 | doi=10.2307/1130468| pmid = 4075871 | jstor = 1130468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms that are taught throughout childhood are influential in an individual's life because the ideas about gender that are typically taught by parents in early years are reinforced outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study done by Dr. Mick Cunningham states that the normative behaviors and attitudes that children observe can influence the way that these children grow up to structure their own households in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Mick|date=April 2001|title=Parental Influences on the Gendered Division of Housework|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|pages=184|doi=10.2307/2657414|via=|jstor=2657414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normative gender roles can be reinforced outside of the household, adding power to these hegemonic ideas about gender. An analysis of children’s books in the twenty-first century, by Janice McCabe, suggests that this particular avenue of children’s media symbolically annihilates females, representing them about half as often as that of males. Underrepresentation such as this can affect children and their views of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|date=2011|title=Gender in Twentieth- Century Children's Books|url=|journal=Gender and Sociology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1177/0891243211398358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children’s TV networks, such as Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network have demonstrated a disproportional representation of males and females on their respective shows in a study done by Beth Hentges and Kim Case. According to Hentges and Case, there are less female characters across all three children’s networks; however, there is more propagation of stereotypical gendered behavior on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon than that of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hentges|first=Beth|last2=Case|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=Gender Representation on Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon Broadcasts in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of Children and Media|volume=7|issue=3|pages=319–333|doi=10.1080/17482798.2012.729150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atypical Household Influence on Gender Socialization ===

Some children are raised in atypical households that challenge normative gender roles. In Jada Tidwell's study, she observes the play of children who come from households with lesbian feminist mothers (both single mothers and couples). Tidwell's observations consisted of both individual play as well as play integrated with the mothers. As a result of these observations, Tidwell asserts that atypical environments can affect children’s lives and ideas. According to Tidwell, households that challenge hegemonic cultural ideas ultimately give children a different perspective of gender than those of children raised in heterosexual, two parent households. In the families studied by Jada Tidwell, children reported ideas that both endorsed and challenged stereotypical gender roles at times.&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, Jada Annette. “Gender Development in Children with Atypical Parental Socialization: An Example of Lesbian Feminist Mothers.” ''Georgia State University,'' US: ProQuest Information &amp; Learning, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different study, Abbie Goldberg observed toddlers from various types of households and how these children engaged in play. Goldberg's findings suggest that children whose parents are of the same gender tend to play in ways that are less adherent to stereotypical gender roles than children from heterosexual households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Abbie|date=November 2012|title=Gender- Typed Play Behavior in Early Childhood: Adopted Children with Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Parents|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=67|issue=9–10|pages=503–515|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0198-3|pmid=23420542|pmc=3572788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Witt, in her article “Parental Influence on Children’s Socialization to Gender Roles’, advocates for androgynous gender roles in parenting, arguing that environments are more open minded about gender and encouraging to both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Gender and psychoanalysis==
One of the most influential of the psychoanalytic theories of gender identity is the perspective developed in the book The Reproduction of Mothering. Its author, Nancy Chodorow, traces the implications for emotional development by linking them with the way mothers usually care for their infants in their formative years, while fathers are more emotionally distant. The development of an identity takes place as the infant gets more and more separated from his/her mother, with whom the infant is initially psychically merged. This process however operates differently for boys and girls. Girls can separate gradually, maintain a continuous sense of relationship with the mother, who is after all experienced as alike. For boys, on the other hand, separating from the mother, who is experienced as different, involves repressing the feminine aspects of themselves and rejecting their tenderness that was central to that early relationship. Boys' sense of maleness, according to Chodorow, is achieved at a great emotional cost.&lt;ref&gt;Chodorow, N. (1978). ''The Reproduction of Mothering'', Berkeley, CA, and London, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, men grow up to have a more autonomous sense of self, and to be more independent, more instrumental and competitive in their dealings with others. They are also more likely to have difficulty expressing their emotions and to be anxious about intimacy. Women, on the other hand, have more ability and more need to sustain relationship with others.; they have greater empathy with others. They have difficulty however in maintaining the boundaries of an independent and autonomous self.

Chodorow however believes that these patterns aren't inevitable. Changes in the social arrangements for care of children such as dual parenting, which would involve fathers in emotional intimacy with their children, can break the cycle.

==Gender and the division of labor==
Before industrialization, economic activity, which centered around agricultural work, crafts and so on, was organized by households. Household members, whether male or female, young or old, contributed to the family's livelihood. Although women might do some types of work and men others, depending on region and class, the distinction between men as breadwinners and women as housewives didn't characterize pre-industrial divisions of labor.

Industrialization shifted much productive activity to factories, shops and offices. This separation of work from home signaled a profound change in gender relations and gender discourse. The home came to be understood not as the site of a family enterprise, but as a refuge from the world of work. Women were defined as the keepers of the home, as it was seen as their nature to create harmony and virtue rather than services and goods. Preindustrial society relied on gendered roles in the workforce to create equilibrium between men and women. Men were assigned the hunter role while women were assigned the domestic roles. Men were expected to supply food and shelter for the family while women were the caretakers for the children and their household. As centuries passed, this continued and created a divide in gendered roles in labor. Women remained dependent on men to provide, this dependence led to male roles being more valued in society which still remains in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gender in conversation==
Some research has found that, in classroom settings, male students tend to talk more, and longer, than female students. This was determined to be particularly noticeable when the instructor is male.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985&gt;{{cite web |last=Krupnick |first=Catherine G. |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/krupnick.html |title=Women and Men in the Classroom: Inequality and Its Remedies |work=On Teaching and Learning, Volume 1 |year=1985 |accessdate=3013-06-23 |publisher=Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results were found previously in hospitals by Erving Goffman in 1961, university discussion groups by Elizabeth Aries in 1972, and in corporate settings by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985/&gt;

=== Gender in the workplace ===
Women and men experience different types of mobility within the workplace. Women tend to experience a [[glass ceiling]], an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a "glass escalator" effect in which they are able to quickly ascend the job hierarchy to become managers and principals.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Christine L., "The Glass Escalator: The Hidden Advantages for Men in the "Female" Professions", Social Problems, 39(3), pp. 253-267&lt;/ref&gt; There also tends to be a [[gender pay gap]] between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
 
One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to [[occupational segregation]], which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another cause is the [[double burden]], a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third cause is [[occupational sexism]], one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status.&lt;ref&gt;Coltrane, Scott. 1997. Family Man: Fatherhood, Housework, and Gender Equity. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 class action lawsuit, [[Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]], charged Wal-Mart with sexist hiring and promotion practices.

In addition, the emergence of [[transgender]] individuals in the workplace has begun to disrupt the gender binary of male and female.  By creating a hybrid gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;Connel, C. "Doing, Undoing, or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople."  Gender &amp; Society, 24(1), 31-55&lt;/ref&gt; the transgender community suggests notions of movement toward [[postgenderism]].{{peacock term|date=June 2013}}

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is a [[Neo-Marxist]] concept stemming from a [[critical theory]] social analysis of [[class (social)|class]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[gender]]. The theory of intersectionality argues that forms of "inequality, oppression, and privilege" are shaped by interconnected axes of identity, and are mutually reinforced by social interactions and by social, political, and economic structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and institutionalized heteronormativity.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"&gt;Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker, "Doing Difference," Gender and Society 9, no. 1 (Feb 1995): 8-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of Intersectionality argues that race, class, gender, and other markers of identity are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. Z. (1987). Doing Gender. Gender and Society, 1 (2), 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory argues against the assumption that systems of power relations are normative and can hold individuals accountable for their own character and efforts.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

West &amp; Fenstermaker in their 1995 article ''[[Doing Difference]]'' offer that models that conceive gender, race and class as distinct axes are highly limiting in their understanding of the whole experience or identity of an individual. For example, they critique the additive model, in which the whole will never be greater (or lesser) than the sum of it parts. By analyzing each identity marker as an individual characteristic, we ignore the effect of the interconnection of these markers.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

Additional sociologists have written about the intersectionality of class, race, and gender. Joan Acker outlines four gendered processes of intersectionality. The first includes procedures that create hierarchies based on gender and race. Another is the process in which social images and ideas condone gendered institutions. The third is a process of interaction between individuals and groups that, through communication, creates gender. The fourth is the internal labeling of the self and others to gendered personas.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, J. (1992). From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions. Contemporary Sociology, 21 (5), 565-569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evelyn Nakano Glenn]] critiques both the patriarchy model of gender, which ignores racial differences among oppressed women, and the internal colonialism model, which focuses on minority populations in general, ignoring gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, E. N. (1985). Racial Ethnic Women's Labor: The Intersection of Race, Gender and Class Oppression. Review of Radical Political Economics, 17 (85), 86-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embodiment==

Embodiment may be defined as the ways in which cultural ideals of gender in a given society create expectations for and influence the form of our bodies. There is a bidirectional relationship between biology and culture; by embodying societally determined [[gender roles]] we reinforce cultural ideals and simultaneously shape, both temporarily and permanently, our bodies, which then perpetuates the cultural ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Connel, R.W. 2002. ''Gender: Short Introductions.'' Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is actually more variation in body type within the male and female sexes than there is between the two sexes, embodiment exaggerates the perceived bodily differences between gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. ''The Gendered Society.'' New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social embodiment, for both men and women, is variable across cultures and over time. Examples of women embodying [[gender norms]] across cultures include [[foot binding]] practices in Chinese culture, [[neck rings]] in African and Asian cultures, and [[corsets]] in Western cultures. Another interesting phenomenon has been the practice of wearing [[high heels]], which shifted from a masculine fashion to a feminine fashion over time. In the United States, the ideal body image and dimensions have changed for both women and men, with the body ideal [[female body shape]] becoming progressively slimmer and the body ideal for men becoming progressively larger.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Susan. 1999. "Never Just Pictures" in ''Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' University of California Press, pp. 107-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences are epitomized in the example of children's toys; [[G.I. Joe]] dolls depict the physical ideals for boys and [[Barbie]] dolls embody the ideals for girls. [[The Beauty Myth]], as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, refers to the unattainable standard of beauty for women, which sustains [[consumer culture]]. In contrast, men's bodies are also "dictated" by cultural ideals of gender, as is evident in consumer culture—especially beer commercials—in which men are portrayed as outdoorsy, tough, strong, and "manly."&lt;ref&gt;Buysse, J.A.M. and Embser-Herbert, M.S. "Construction of Gender in Sport: An Analysis of Intercollegiate Media Guide Cover Photographs." ''Gender and Society'', 18 (1), 2004, pp. 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==

Sexuality encompasses both sexual behavior and sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Pepper, and Virginia Rutter. 1998. The Gender of Sexuality. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Heteronormativity]] structures social life so that [[Heterosexuality]] is always assumed, expected, ordinary and privileged. Its pervasiveness makes it difficult for people to imagine other ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stevi. 2006. Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: The complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory 7:105-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media works to glorify heterosexuality, which in turn lends to its pervasiveness and to its power.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"&gt;Martin, K.A., &amp; Kayzak, E. (2009). Hetero-Romantic Love and Heterosexiness in Children's G-Rated Films. Gender and Society, 23(3), 315-336.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize heterosexuality; thus, it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"/&gt;

There is a common perception of heterosexuality as the "natural" emotional and sensual inclination for [[Human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. Signs, 5(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, marital heterosexuality occupies the largely invisible core of normative and desirable sexuality, while all other sexualities are marginalized and considered perverse and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2008). State of our Unions: Marriage Promotion and the Contested Power of Heterosexuality. Gender &amp; Society, 23(1), 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale called the [[Kinsey Scale]], which challenges the common perception of [[Human sexuality]] as strictly binary and directly linked to [[Gender]]. [[Drag queens]] are an example of "troubling" gender, complicating the understanding of sexuality in our society by causing people to think outside the binary of male/female.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, J. and Jasper, J.M. (eds). The Contexts Reader. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. Pp. 247-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|title=Origin  of the Family, Private Property, and the State|date=1884|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that in hunter-gatherer societies the activities of men and women, although different, had the same importance. As technological advances let to productive surplus, social equality and communal sharing gave way to private property and ultimately class hierarchy. With the rise of agriculture, men gained significant power over women. With surplus wealth to pass on to their heirs, upper class men wanted to ensure their sons were indeed theirs, which led them to control the sexuality of women. The desire to control property brought about monogamous marriage and family. Women were taught to remain virgins until marriage and remain faithful to their husbands thereafter, and to build their lives around bearing and raising one man's children.

==Masculinity==

[[Masculinity]] is a performed gender identity. Contrary to popular perception{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, it is not the same as [[sex]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The contents and practices of masculinity are socially constructed and reproduced through daily interaction, especially on a more micro scale.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists West &amp; Zimmerman emphasized that gender is maintained through accountability.

The dominant form of masculinity in a society is known as [[hegemonic masculinity]].

Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes three cultures that support masculinity (especially in young men) in his 2008 book, ''Guyland'':
* The Culture of Entitlement: Men are raised to feel they deserve something. They feel entitled to power, sex and women.
* The Culture of Silence: Men are not to talk to outsiders (those not embedded in the cultures of masculinity) about drinking, bullying, rape, or any performance of masculinity by their peers that they may get in trouble for. If they do talk, they will be seen as unmanly traitors.
* The Culture of Protection: Communities do not hold men responsible for questionable and illegal actions. Many turn a blind eye, assuming their boys would never do that. Others write off dangerous acts as "boys will be boys".&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Some of the prominent attitudes and behaviors of western hegemonic masculinity are: power, sexual dominance and activity, wealth, aggression, independence, and lack of emotion. Less extreme sexual harassment is often seen as normal behavior.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; Exemplifying [[control theory]], the norms of masculinity are so rigidly ingrained that men find little room to escape and end up constantly reproducing them.

Hegemonic masculinity is often reproduced and reinforced through media and culture. "Media representations of men…often glorify men's use of physical force, a daring demeanor, virility, and emotional distance." Contemporary [[rap music]] is a striking example of masculinity on display. Rappers boast about their sexual conquests of women (emphasizing [[heterosexuality]] as well), wealth, power and violence.&lt;ref name="Rap Music"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Kubrin | first2 = Charis E. | author-link1 = Ronald Weitzer | author-link2 = Charis E.

==Gender and violence==

Gender-based [[violence]] is the physical, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or emotional harm or suffering enacted upon an individual as contextualized by societal [[gender]] norms. Violence affects the lives of millions worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of many to participate fully in society. Violence is about power, control, and domination. Systems of inequality and [[oppression]] interact positioning certain groups as particularly vulnerable to violence. Gendered violence takes place within a socially constructed power dynamic in which one ideology ([[masculinity]]) dominates another ([[femininity]]). What it means to be a woman in society is influenced and ascribed by the media, which acts a "powerful educational force". The media glamorizes [[violence against women]] cultivating a "toxic cultural environment" in which women are institutionally positioned as inferior and worthy objects of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Killing Us Softly 3: Advertising's Image of Women. Dir. Jean Kilbourne. Perf., 2000. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are disproportionally the offenders, and women disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are overwhelmingly male—[[rape]] (98%), armed [[robbery]] (92%), drunk driving (90%), [[murder]] (88%), aggravated assault (87%), arson (86%), and family violence (83%).&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Kimmel]], [[hegemonic masculinity]] creates a culture of entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. Guyland: the Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. New York: Harpercollins, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence]] defines three social arenas in which violence commonly takes place (1) in the family—including [[domestic violence]], [[infanticide]], and traditional practices such as  [[female genital mutilation]], [[foot binding]], and [[bride burning]]; (2) in the community—including rape, sexual assault, [[sexual harassment]], and commercialized violence such as [[sexual slavery]], labor exploitation, female migrant workers; and (3) by the State—including violence against women in detention, and in situations of armed conflict such as [[systematic war rape]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women and Violence." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.un.org/rights/dpi1772e.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address and end gendered violence, solutions must address both the root causes and interpersonal manifestations of gender roles and power relations in order to ensure a balance of power at all levels of society.

==Globalization and gender==

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture, people and economic activity. Globalization impacts female equality on a large and international scale, both negatively and positively.  With continuous changes in international relations, the perception of [[feminism]] in Western and Nonwestern societies is frequently revised.  It is important to be wary of Western bias in sociological accounts of global feminism, as Modern [[Western society]] is not always due credit for feminist reform in other cultures and countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ferree, Myra Marx. 2006. "Globalization and Feminism: Opportunities and Obstacles for Activism in the Global Arena" in Ferree, M.M. &amp; Tripp, A.M. (Eds.) Global Feminism: Transnational women's activism, organizing, and human rights. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist sentiments – or a push for gender equality – emerge as a result of the nation-specific circumstances, not according to the exported beliefs of Western society.  Advances in female equality and status are often not the result of national groups or corporations, but of individuals and small groups.

One of the results of globalization is the increased use of female factory workers in nonwestern countries.  In Mexico, the female worker is ideal because she is seen as docile and inexpensive labor.  Stereotypical feminine traits such as beauty, domesticity, and docility are exaggerated and exploited for the production of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Salzinger, L. 2003. Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender traits then frame the behavior of the women beyond the occupational realm.  Despite increasing feminism, the lack of economic and [[social mobility]] prevents women in many nations from having equal status in society.

One of the solutions to erasing gender inequalities globally, is to provide resources and funds to impoverished women who will in turn use them for [[education]] as well as business ventures.  The [[global economy]] could benefit drastically from incorporating educated women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|title=The Women’s Crusade|first1=Nicholas|last1=Kristof|first2=Sheryl|last2=WuDunn|date=17 August 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third gender ==
Throughout history, and around the world, the idea of a [[third gender]] has existed. In Native American culture, the [[Two-spirit|two spiririt]] had gender roles different from men and women. The [[muxe]] of southern Mexico are males who identify as neither male or female. In Samoa the [[Fa'afafine]] are biological males who identify as females. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] are biological males who identify as women. They are considered outsiders in their communities and have formed their own language. In the United States, the concept of a third gender is beginning to gain traction. California now allows for drivers licenses to have the gender "non-binary", see [[genderqueer]].

A '''stamped circuit board''' ('''SCB''') is used to mechanically support and electrically connect [[electronic component]]s using [[Conductor (material)|conductive]] pathways, tracks or [[signal trace|trace]]s [[industrial etching|etch]]ed from copper sheets [[laminated]] onto a non-conductive ''substrate''. This technology is used for small circuits, for instance in the production of [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledsmagazine.com/press/21258 Heraeus SCB technology enhances thermal management in LED luminaires], LEDs Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[printed circuit board]]s this layer structure may comprise glass-fibre reinforced epoxy resin and copper. Basically, in the case of LED substrates three variations are possible: 
# the PCB (printed circuit board),
# plastic-injection molding and
# the SCB.

Using the SCB technology it is possible to structure and laminate the most widely differing material combinations in a reel-to-reel production process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.displayplus.net/xe/37141 Heraeus SCB technology enhances thermal management in LED luminaires], Display Plus&lt;/ref&gt; As the layers are structured separately, improved design concepts are able to be implemented. Consequently, a far better and quicker heat dissipation from within the chip is achieved.

== Production ==
Both the plastic and the metal are initially processed on separate reels, .i.e. in accordance with the requirements the materials are individually structured by stamping (“brought into form“) and then merged.

== Advantages ==
The engineering respectively choice of substrates actually comes down to the particular application, module design/substrate assembly, material and thickness of the material involved.

Taking these parameters it is possible to attain a good thermal management by using SCB technology, because rapid heat dissipation from beneath the chip means a longer service life for the system. Furthermore, SCB technology allows the material to be chosen to correspond to the pertinent requirements and then to optimize the design to arrive at a “perfect fit”.

In this phase of the experiment, plants were oriented since they grew in 1-g from an on-board centrifuge.]]'''TROPI''', or "Analysis of a Novel Sensory Mechanism in Root Phototropism", is an experiment on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) to investigate the growth and development of plant seedlings under various gravity and lighting combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Tropi.html |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203064705/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Tropi.html |title=Fact Sheet|archivedate=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] during the [[STS-130]] mission and was performed on the ISS during [[Expedition 22]]. Frozen plant samples from the TROPI experiment were returned on the landing of the [[STS-131]] mission on [[Space Shuttle Discovery]].

[[Arabidopsis thaliana]] seeds, (thale cress, the [[genome]] of which has been [[DNA]] sequenced as a reference organism for the study of plant biology and genetics), were germinated and grown under various lighting and gravity conditions, using [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] gravity-simulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7I3CnRdTCQ |title=ISS experiment-Plants in space-TROPI2-start |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LED]]s of various wavelengths (colors) and intensities to model lighting conditions. The specific aim of this project was to investigate [[phototropism]] in plants grown in [[microgravity]] conditions without the complications of a 1-g environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/pdf/423451main_Tropi-2_FactSheet3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tropi : Studying Plant Growth in Space |website=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments performed were used to explore the mechanisms of both blue-light- and red-light-induced phototropism in plants.

'''Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr''' (TSKK) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] research-institute working on issues related to the [[Konkani language]], literature, culture and education. It is based in Alto [[Porvorim]], on the outskirts of the state capital of [[Goa]], India.

==Aim==

The TSKK says it "is devoted to the promotion of education and research in the Konknni language, literature and culture". It was registered under the Societies Registration Act in 1982 and first functioned from 1986 at the locality of [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], before its current premises was built. It is located alongside the also Jesuit [[Xavier Centre of Historical Research]].

==Current status, and name==

TSKK is a Society registered under the Indian [[Societies Registration Act]] of  1860. From June 1999, it has been recognized by the [[Goa University]] as a  Konknni research institute.

This institution gets its name from the sixteenth-century English Jesuit priest, [[Thomas Stephens (missionary)|Thomas Stephens]] (1549–1619), a linguist and Marathi poet. Stephens came to Goa, then a Portuguese colony, on 24 October 1579. According to the institution, Stephens learned the Konknni and Marathi languages and wrote in them. He produced the first grammar to be produced in an Indian language, in Konknni  printed in 1622. Stephens died in Goa in 1619.

==Research bulletin==
[[File:India Goa TSKKBulletin.jpg|thumb|TSKK's Sod research bulletin]]

One of the activities of the TSKK is the publication of a research bulletin called ''Sod''. This journal is edited, produced and published as part of TSKK's "research efforts ... devoted to the promotion of education and research in (the) Konknni language, literature and culture". Its articles are a mix of Konknni written in Devanagari-script, [[Konkani in the Roman script|the Roman (Romi) script]], and occasionally in English too.

Issue No 10 April 2006 contains the following articles: 

* Konkani Myths: Pratap Naik SJ
* Social damage done by Goa's language controversy and (the) conspiracy behind it. Ramnath G Naik
* Roman script, the soul of Konknni. Nelson Lopes.
* Socio-economic growth of the Goan community through the Konkani language. Tomazinho Cardozo
* Roman script for Konkani, a must: now or never. Godfrey Gonsalves.
* Script controversy. Eduardo Faleiro.
* A response to "Konknni Myths". Alito Siqueira.

* English medium primary education for better future. Cypriano Lopes.
* Response to "English medium primary education for better future" Joe F Vaz.

Generally ''Sod'' issues are priced at Rs 50 each (in Goa).

==Courses in Konkani, etc==

TSKK also offers courses in the [[Konknni]] language, and on project methodology for researchers, and study methodology for students. Currently (September 2006), the TSKK is working on language-teaching books for adults and children to learn Konkani (in the '''Romi''' or '''Roman''' script).

==Management and location==
[[File:India Goa TSKK PratapNaik.jpg|thumb|Pratap Naik, sj, director of TSKK]]
Earlier, this institute was headed by [[Fr Mathew Almeida, sj]] who has been succeeded by [[Fr Pratap Naik sj]].

Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr is located at B.B.Borkar Road, Alto Porvorim, Goa (India) 403 521.

==Publications==

TSKK has come out with a number of publications in the [[Konknni]] language, or in languages like English introducing themes related to [[Konknni]], which is India's smallest language, spoken mainly along the west coast of this country.  

Some of its publication include a 1988 guide to writing [[Devanagari]] script [[Konknni]] (20 pp, then priced at Rs 3, now out of print), ''A Description of Konknni'' by [[Matthew Almeida, sj]] (1989), ''Teacher's and Parent's Manual'' (1996, pp 150)by Pratap Naik,S.J., ''TSKK Konknni Basic Course'' (Matthew Almeida, SJ, 1991), ''Tisvaddeacheo Igorzo'' ([[Moreno de Souza]], SJ, 1994, on the churches of the sub-district of [[Tiswadi]] in Goa), ''TSKK Romi Lipi'' (TSKK's orthography for Roman-script Konknni by Pratap Naik, SJ 2005 pp 52).

In addition it has also brought out five cassettes and CDs, of Konknni music containing devotional songs and nursery rhymes and children's songs.

==TSKK's plant collection==
[[File:India Goa TSKKgarden.jpg|thumb|TSKK's botanical garden]]

[[Jesuit]] priest [[Pratap Naik sj]], director of the TSKK currently, has been building a collection of over 328 trees and plants, all in the yard of a research institution studying the local [[Konknni]] language. Naik  argues that the culture of a place is reflected "not only" in its language, but also in its flora—apart from its fauna, architecture, food habits and dress.

He has been quoted saying that he wants to grow one of every fruit-bearing tree that grows in [[Goa]] which is rich in plant diversity. This richness is thanks in significant part to plant exchanges by the former rulers who centuries back controlled international seaways and had an empire straddling the continents.

Many months of hard work has seen Naik piece together a well-maintained and neatly labelled botanical garden. Visible are the local names in Konknni, the botanical names, their [[English language|English]] names. Elsewhere, he keeps a list of the original native countries of these [[Goa]]-adopted plants.

Among the collection are the '''ainno madd''' (the Fan Palm in [[English language|English]], or [[Livistona rotundifolia]] as it's known by its botanical name). It comes from tropical [[United States|America]].  There's the '''ambaddo''', dismissively perhaps called the [[Spondias|hog-plum]] that traces its origins to [[India]] itself. The '''ambor''' ([[mulberry]], or [[Morus alba]]) has [[China|Chinese]] origins. '''Kalljirem''' (black cumin, [[Nigella sativa]]) is again of [[India]]n origin. 

'''Kiraitem''' ([[canscora]] in English, or [[Canscora decussata]]) is from [[India]], but the '''zaifoll''' ([[nutmeg]], [[Mystica fragans]]) comes from the [[Moluccas]], the so-called [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of past centuries, in the [[Far East]]. '''Gozgo''' (the [[fever nut]] or [[Caesalpinia bonduc]]) is, again, of [[India]]n origin.

Naik says he has already found the names of 325 species from among the 329 he planted. "Some don't have names in Konknni (the local language)," he is quoted as saying, obviously because of their exotic origins.

The '''University of Alberta''' (also known as '''U of A''' and '''UAlberta''') is a [[Public university|public]] research university located in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It was founded in 1908 by [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]],&lt;ref name=Rutherford&gt;"A Gentleman of Strathcona – [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]]", Douglas R. Babcock, 1989, The [[University of Calgary]] Press, 2500 University Drive NW, [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada, {{ISBN|0-919813-65-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first premier of Alberta, and [[Henry Marshall Tory]],&lt;ref name=Tory&gt;"[[Henry Marshall Tory]], A Biography", originally published 1954, current edition January 1992, E.A. Corbett, Toronto: Ryerson Press, {{ISBN|0-88864-250-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; its first president. Its enabling legislation is the ''Post-secondary Learning Act.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=p19p5.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779737932|title=Post-secondary Learning Act|date=2006-12-28|publisher=Qp.alberta.ca|accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university comprises four campuses in Edmonton, the Augustana Campus in Camrose, and a staff centre in downtown Calgary. The original north campus consists of 150 buildings covering 50 city blocks on the south rim of the [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system|North Saskatchewan River valley]], directly across from [[downtown Edmonton]]. 39,000 students from Canada and 150 other countries participate in 400 programs in 18 faculties.

The University of Alberta is a major economic driver in Alberta. The university's impact on the Alberta economy is an estimated $12.3 billion annually, or five per cent of the province's gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.ualberta.ca/article.aspx?id=2CA43617BB3C4D1FAAE2A50D5911279F |title=U of A has $12.3-billion impact on Alberta economy |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009182632/http://www.news.ualberta.ca/article.aspx?id=2CA43617BB3C4D1FAAE2A50D5911279F |archive-date=October 9, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has been recognized by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], the [[QS World University Rankings]] and the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] as one of the top five universities in Canada and one of the top 100 universities worldwide. According to the 2014 QS World University Rankings, the top Faculty Area at the University of Alberta is Arts and Humanities (ranked 89th in the world), and the top-ranked Subject is English Language and Literature (22nd in the world).&lt;ref name="QS World University Rankings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2014 |title=QS World University Rankings |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited |accessdate=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Alberta is also a leading institution for the study of Ukraine and is home to the [[Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/canadian-institute-of-ukrainian-studies/about/mandate|title=Mandate - Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|website=www.ualberta.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Alberta has graduated more than 260,000 alumni, including Governor General [[Roland Michener]]; Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]]; Chief Justice of Canada [[Beverley McLachlin]]; Alberta premiers [[Peter Lougheed]], [[Dave Hancock]], [[Jim Prentice]] and [[Rachel Notley]]; Edmonton Mayor [[Don Iveson]] and Nobel laureate [[Richard E. Taylor]].

The university is a member of the [[Alberta Rural Development Network]], the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System.

==History==

The University of Alberta, a single, public provincial university, was chartered in 1906 in [[Edmonton, Alberta]] with the University Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= University Act, 1910|url= http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/history/founding/university_act.html|publisher= University of Alberta|accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the first session of the new [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]], with [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Alexander C. Rutherford]] as its sponsor. The university was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title= University|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242|publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governance was modelled on Ontario's University of Toronto Act of 1906: a bicameral system consisting of a senate (faculty) responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) controlling financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Heated wrangling took place between the cities of [[Calgary]] and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.&lt;ref name=Rutherford/&gt; The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital.

With [[Henry Marshall Tory]] as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction.&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;"All True Things: A History of the University of Alberta, 1908–2008", Rod Macleod, The University of Alberta Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-88864-444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up [[University of British Columbia|McGill University College]] in [[Vancouver]], Tory wrote, ''"If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis."''&lt;ref name=ToryQuote&gt;Tory to Rutherford,  March 6, 1906. University of Alberta Archives (UAA), Rutherford Fonds, 2/3/6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Tory's guidance, the early years were marked by recruitment of professors and construction of the first campus buildings.&lt;ref name=Centenary&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Alberta Centenary - History|url=http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/history/index.html|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Erskine Nobbs]] &amp; [[Frank Darling (architect)|Frank Darling]] designed the master plan for the University of Alberta in 1909–10. Nobbs designed the Arts Building (1914–15), laboratories and Power House (1914). With Cecil S. Burgess, Nobbs designed the Provincial College of Medicine (1920–21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1452 |title=Percy Erskine Nobbs |publisher=Dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architect Herbert Alton Magoon designed several buildings on campus, including St. Stephen's Methodist College (1910) and the residence for professor Rupert C. Lodge (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1460 |title=Herbert Alton Magoon (architect) |publisher=Dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Alberta awarded its first degrees in 1912,&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt; the same year it established the Department of Extension. The Faculty of Medicine was established the following year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of Medical Education in Canada|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Faculty of Agriculture began in 1915. But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy). It awarded a range of degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture]] (BSA), [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), [[Bachelor of Pharmacy]] (PhmB), [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD), [[Master of Arts]] (MA), [[Master of Science]] (MSc), and [[Doctor of Laws]] (LLD). There were 851 male students and 251 female students, and 171 academic staff, including 14 women.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

The Breton Soil Plots were established at the faculty of agriculture from 1929 – present to provide agricultural research on fertilization, usage, crop rotations and farming practices on Gray-Luvisolic soils (Gray-Wooded), which cover many regions in western Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/GetMuseumProfile.do?lang=en&amp;chinCode=guaeva|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628051947/http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/GetMuseumProfile.do?lang=en&amp;chinCode=guaeva|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-28|title=Breton Soil Plots}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Alberta spearheaded an extraordinary rate of volunteerism in the Province of [[Alberta]] to the [[First World War]], especially from its medical faculty. Experience gained was used by returning [[veterans]] to rapidly mature the young [[Faculty of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Calgary, Edmonton and the University of Alberta: the extraordinary medical mobilization by Canada's newest province |journal= Can J Surg |year=2017 |pages=296–299 |volume=60 |issue= 5 |doi=10.1503/cjs.012117 |pmc=5608576 |pmid=28930035 | last1 = Da Cambra | first1 = MP | last2 = McAlister | first2 = VC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Memorial Committee commissioned a War Memorial Pipe Organ to be erected by the [[Casavant Frères]] in U of A Convocation Hall in 1925 in memory of 80 University of Alberta comrades who gave up their lives during the Great War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/ALUMNI/history/traditions/47octorgan.htm|title=Memorial Organ|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; In 1929, the university established a College of Education. This period of growth was to be short-lived, though, as the Great Depression and the Second World War curtailed enrolment and expansion until 1945.&lt;ref name=Centenary /&gt; The university also gained new public powers. In 1928, the university's senate was granted the power to oversee and appoint half of the [[Alberta Eugenics Board]], charged with recommending individuals for sterilization.&lt;ref name="Puplampu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Puplampu |first=Korbla |authorlink= |date=Summer 2008|volume=54|issue=2|journal=The Alberta Journal of Educational Research |title=Knowledge, Power, and Social Policy: John M. MacEachran and Alberta’s 1928 Sexual Sterilization Act|pages=129–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by postwar growth in the student population and the discovery of oil in Leduc in 1947, the University of Alberta underwent expansion through the 1950s that continued through the 1960s as the baby-boom generation swelled the enrolment ranks.&lt;ref name=Centenary /&gt; These two decades also saw expansion of campus buildings, including new buildings for the faculties of physical education and education, and the Cameron Library.&lt;ref name=Centenary /&gt; The [[University of Alberta Press]], concentrating on western Canadian history, general science and ecology, was founded in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= University Presses|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008267|publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary.&lt;ref name="pound2005"&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, the [[University of Calgary]] had been established as an autonomous institution.&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt;

From the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Collège Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls.&lt;ref name=Centenary /&gt; New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre. Another new building, the distinctive Universiade Pavilion (nicknamed the "Butterdome"), was completed as part of the university's preparations to host the World University Games in 1983, the first time the event was held in North America.&lt;ref name=Centenary /&gt;

The 1990s were a time of financial constraint as the Alberta government made budgetary cutbacks.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; but they were also a time in which the university benefited from philanthropic support. The $11-million Timms Centre for the Arts, which began construction in 1993, was made possible by a large donation from its namesake, Albert Timms.&lt;ref name=Centenary /&gt; In 1998, Gladys Young's $3.5-million donation to the university undergraduate scholarship fund in memory of Roland Young, who graduated from the U of A in 1928, was the largest private donation for undergraduate scholarships in the university's history.&lt;ref name="pound2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cobalt king remembers U of A with $3.5 million|url=http://www.folio.ualberta.ca/36/13/front.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101075021/http://www.folio.ualberta.ca/36/13/front.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 January 2013|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
The university has five distributed campuses including, in addition to the North Campus, two auxiliary satellites: Campus Saint-Jean in southeast Edmonton, and Augustana Campus in [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], 90 kilometres southeast of Edmonton. An extensively renovated and refurbished historic [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] department store in downtown Edmonton, renamed Enterprise Square, serves as a campus for adult students belonging to the Faculty of Extension. The university owns a set of large parcels of mostly undeveloped land (used as an experimental farm and the site of several agricultural and sports facilities) slightly south of the main campus, called South Campus (previously the University Farm), in which an entire new university complex of similar magnitude to the North Campus will be constructed.

Detailed Google Maps views and 360-degree interactive panoramas of the campus can be seen on the University of Alberta website.

===North Campus===

{{Main|List of University of Alberta buildings}}

[[File:U of A.jpg|thumb|The University of Alberta overlooks the North Saskatchewan River valley and downtown Edmonton.]]The North Campus is the original location of the University of Alberta. Located on the southern banks of the [[North Saskatchewan River]], it has 150 buildings on {{convert|92|ha|acre}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year = 2012|url = http://www.aucc.ca/canadian-universities/our-universities/university-of-alberta-3|title = The Directory of Canadian Universities: University of Alberta|publisher = AUCC|accessdate = August 31, 2012|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120923081056/http://www.aucc.ca/canadian-universities/our-universities/university-of-alberta-3|archive-date = September 23, 2012|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect [[Barton Myers]] completed the long-range campus plan in 1969 and continued as a planner for the University until 1978.

The distinctive cupola of the Dentistry/Pharmacy Centre on North Campus was featured in a commemorative stamp issued by Canada Post in 2008, the year of the university's centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(University.TITP.)+Or+(University.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=14&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101011441/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(University.TITP.)+Or+(University.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=14&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 1, 2013|title=Canadian Postal Archives Database|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Campus===
Located two kilometres south of the North Campus, the South Campus is much larger in terms of land area. The two campuses are linked by [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit|Light Rail Transit]]. The [[South Campus/Fort Edmonton Park station|LRT station]] is near '''Foote Field''' and the '''Saville Community Sports Centre''', forming a natural gateway to the new campus architectural model, since 2009. Along with [[Health Sciences/Jubilee station|Health Sciences]], [[University station (Edmonton)|University]], and [[Bay/Enterprise Square station|Enterprise Square stations]], the LRT connects the U of A through four stations.

Much of the university's agricultural research in food safety and crop use for food and industrial products happens at the Edmonton Research Station Experimental Farms on South Campus. This campus is also home to the Saville Community Sports Centre, a 32,500-square-metre, multi-use recreation facility that hosts 14 varsity teams and several community sports clubs. In 2013, the Saville Centre became the new training centre for the Canadian senior women's basketball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edmonton home to Canada's senior women's basketball team|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2013/06/27/edmonton-women-basketball-team.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus Saint-Jean===
The [[University of Alberta Faculté Saint-Jean|Campus Saint-Jean]] is a [[francophone]] campus located five kilometres east of the main campus, in [[Bonnie Doon, Edmonton|Bonnie Doon]]. It is the only French-language university campus west of [[Manitoba]]. Due to increasing enrolment, the Campus Saint-Jean is undergoing expansion, acquiring new laboratory and classroom spaces. Students at Campus Saint-Jean pursue bachelor's degrees in the sciences or arts, or complete their first year of Engineering, after which they often transfer to the University of Alberta's main campus. Bilingual Nursing and Business programs are also available.

===Augustana Campus===
The [[University of Alberta Augustana Faculty|Augustana Campus]] is located in [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], a small city in rural Alberta about 100&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Edmonton. In 2004, the former [[Augustana University College]] in Camrose merged with the University of Alberta, thus creating the new satellite Augustana Campus. Students enrolled at the Augustana Campus currently pursue four-year bachelor's degrees in arts, sciences, or music.

===Enterprise Square===
Enterprise Square opened for business January 15, 2008 on the north side of the [[North Saskatchewan]] river in downtown [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year = 2008|url=http://www.enterprisesquare.ualberta.ca/~/media/enterprisesquare/Documents/LaunchMediaRelease15Jan2008.pdf|title = University of Alberta officially opens Enterprise Square downtown campus|publisher = University of Alberta|accessdate =October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the historical building previously occupied by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. The building underwent major renovations. Enterprise Square houses the [[University of Alberta Faculty of Extension]], the professional development activities of the [[University of Alberta School of Business|Alberta School of Business]], the Alberta Business Family Institute, and the Design Gallery. It is the home of the University of Alberta Alumni Association.

===Edmonton Clinic Health Academy===

The Edmonton Clinic (formerly the Health Science Ambulatory Learning Centre) is a joint project with Alberta Health Services, and consists of two separate buildings. Construction started in 2008 on the multidisciplinary health science facilities totalling $909 million and 170,000 square metres surrounding the [[Health Sciences/Jubilee LRT Station|Health Sciences LRT Station]]. Edmonton Clinic South (now known as [[Edmonton Clinic|Kaye Edmonton Clinic]]), a nine-storey building, will focus on patient care and house most of the medical and dental clinics, while the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy (ECHA) is a six-storey building that is the home of interdisciplinary health research and education currently held at the university. The Edmonton Clinic Health Academy, owned and operated by the University of Alberta, officially opened in January 2012. The [[Edmonton Clinic|Kaye Edmonton Clinic]], owned and operated by Alberta Health Services, opened in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonclinic.ca/ |title=Edmonton Clinic website |publisher=Edmontonclinic.ca |accessdate=2012-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822225400/http://www.edmontonclinic.ca/ |archive-date=August 22, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health research innovation facilities===
[[File:Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research University Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 01A.jpg|thumb|left|Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research]]
Two new $300-million buildings adjacent to the Heritage Medical Research Centre building on the main campus, along with existing health-care and health research facilities and the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy, form a health precinct of two city blocks dedicated to health research, education and patient care. The newest facilities form a translational research centre designed to create an environment for "bench-to-bedside" health research by increasing interaction between researchers and clinicians focused on common medical issues. A total of 65,000 square metres (699,700 square feet) gross area constructed on two sites contribute to research by allowing the university to hire over 100 additional biomedical and health researchers. This is projected to result in a doubling of research funding by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgi.ualberta.ca/hrif/index.htm|title=Health Research Innovation Facility Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206034540/http://www.cgi.ualberta.ca/hrif/index.htm|archivedate=February 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research'''

The hub of the complex is the Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research (formerly HRIF West), an eight-storey building that provides the main entrance to the complex and becomes the critical link between Medical Sciences Building and Heritage Medical Research Centre. The Katz Group Centre is a teaching and research facility. It is home to the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, led by scientific director [[D. Lorne Tyrrell|Lorne Tyrrell]], MD, PhD, and includes some of the world's top virologists, including [[Michael Houghton (virologist)|Michael Houghton]], PhD, Canada Excellence Research Chair and Li Ka Shing Chair in Virology, who co-led the team that discovered the [[hepatitis C]] virus during his previous career in private industry. The facility is located on the corner of 89 Avenue and 114 Street in Edmonton, Alberta.

'''Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation'''

The Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation (formerly HRIF East) anchors the southeast corner of the health precinct and is also home to the Alberta Diabetes Institute (ADI). Both the east and west buildings of HRIF are linked at every floor to the Heritage Medical Research Centre with the exception of Level 1 of HRIF West. The facility is dedicated to health research and boasts state-of-the-art laboratories for top researchers, including several Canada Research Chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.ualberta.ca/article.aspx?id=32DEAB75F6C245D7B67D182318F4F31D|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101112635/http://www.news.ualberta.ca/article.aspx?id=32DEAB75F6C245D7B67D182318F4F31D|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 1, 2013|title=Article - University of Alberta|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is named in honour of a gift in 2010 of $28 million from the Li Ka Shing (Canada) Foundation that helped establish the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology ($25M) and a joint PhD program ($3M) between the university's Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry and Shantou University Medical College in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/SIGNATURE/LiKaShingCentre.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115150209/http://www.ualberta.ca/SIGNATURE/LiKaShingCentre.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-15|title=The power of partnership: Li Ka Shing Foundation gift and Government of Alberta funding to establish virology institute at University of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of fall 2012, this remains the largest single cash gift to the University of Alberta.

From 1909 to 1929, the university held a ban against fraternities and sororities, since [[Henry Marshall Tory]], the first president of the university, ordered all secret societies, including Upsilon Upsilon and Pi Sigma Phi, to be disbanded.{{sfn|Schoeck|2006|p=214}} The drive to remove the ban begun in 1927, when students had formed the Athenian Club to lobby the university. During the same year, several men had formed the Rocky Mountain Goat Club, which was only official sanctioned due to the lack of any secret rituals or a written constitution.{{sfn|Schoeck|2006|p=214}} The ban on fraternities and sororities would end in 1929, with the departure of President Tory.

==Insignias and other representations==

===Coat of arms===
The university coat of arms was adopted in 1909, following the recommendations of the university's senate to adopt the coat of arms of the province of Alberta as its emblem, with the addition of an open book superimposed upon the cross and a new motto. The coat of arms had undergone a number of changes, with the arms changing in the 1950s in keeping with the graphic style of the time, and in the early-1990s, in the university's efforts to have their arms gain official heraldic authority.&lt;ref name=CoA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkit.ualberta.ca/VisualIdentityGuidelines/CoatOfArms.aspx|title=Coat of Arms|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=19 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201172713/http://www.toolkit.ualberta.ca/VisualIdentityGuidelines/CoatOfArms.aspx|archive-date=February 1, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest design was completed in 1994, being registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on 31 May 1994, and was presented to the university on 13 June 1994.&lt;ref name=CoA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1747&amp;ShowAll=1|title=University of Alberta|publisher=Governor General of Canada|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms consists of a shield displaying the topography of Alberta rendered in the colours of the University. At the base is a prairie wheat field symbolizing Alberta's agricultural industry.&lt;ref name=Co1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.ualberta.ca/en/UofATraditionsandHallmarks/UniversityCoatofArms.aspx|title=University Coat of Arms|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=19 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201172616/http://www.senate.ualberta.ca/en/UofATraditionsandHallmarks/UniversityCoatofArms.aspx|archive-date=February 1, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wavy gold line above represent the hills and rivers of Alberta. The top of the shield is in gold and separated from the rest of the shield by a line suggesting the Rocky Mountains. The book of learning dominates the design.&lt;ref name=Co1 /&gt; A [[great horned owl]], the provincial bird and an accepted symbol of knowledge is used as the crest of the coat of arms.&lt;ref name=Co1 /&gt; The arm's supporters is the [[pronghorn]], taken from the provincial coat of arms, and the golden bear, the mascot of the university.&lt;ref name=Co1 /&gt;

===Motto and song===
The motto of the university, ''Quaecumque vera'', translates to "whatsoever things are true." The original motto ''lux et lex'', was first adopted in 1907, and was translated as "light and law" in Latin. The motto was substituted with the present motto in 1909.&lt;ref name=CoA /&gt; The motto was adopted from the Latin [[Vulgate]] version of the Bible, the [[Epistle to the Philippians]], where it states that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkit.ualberta.ca/WhatIsOurPromise/OurVisionMissionMotto.aspx|title=Our Vision, Mission &amp; Motto|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=19 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201172715/http://www.toolkit.ualberta.ca/WhatIsOurPromise/OurVisionMissionMotto.aspx|archive-date=February 1, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
The official colours of the university are green and gold. The green represents the wide stretches of prairie land flanked by deep spruce forests and is symbolic of hope and optimism; the gold represents the golden harvest fields and is symbolic of the light of knowledge.&lt;ref name=col /&gt; The original suggestion for green and gold colours came from Marion Kirby Alexander, drawing inspiration from the autumn colours of the river valley below the campus.&lt;ref name=col&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.ualberta.ca/UofATraditionsandHallmarks/UniversityColours.aspx|title=University Colours|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=19 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201172709/http://www.senate.ualberta.ca/UofATraditionsandHallmarks/UniversityColours.aspx|archive-date=February 1, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband, William Hardy Alexander, a professor at the university, relayed the suggestion to a faculty meeting on 5 October 1908 and would later gain the approval of the senate.&lt;ref name=col /&gt; The university colours are present throughout the institution.

An '''urban planner''' is a professional who practices in the field of [[urban planning]]. 

An urban planner may focus on a specific area of practice and have a title such as city planner, town planner, regional planner, long-range planner, transportation planner, infrastructure planner, environmental planner, parks planner, physical planner, health planner, planning analyst, urban designer, community development director, economic development specialist or other similar combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning Specializations|url=https://www.planning.org/choosingplanning/specializations/|website=Choosing the Planning Profession|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Job Titles - Urban and land use planners (NOC 2153-A)|url=https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/job_titles-eng.do;jsessionid=755C0BE610A7CF0F664ADE37A76DE867.imnav4?area=9219&amp;lang=eng&amp;noc=2153&amp;backurl=%2Freport-eng.do%3Farea%3D9219%26lang%3Deng%26noc%3D2153|website=National Occupational Classification 2011 -ESDC|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An international association of planning professionals - ISOCARP - was established in 1965 in the Netherlands and currently has about 700 members in more than 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - ISOCARP|url = http://isocarp.org/|website = ISOCARP|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - Wikipedia/ISOCARP|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISOCARP|website = Wikipedia|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities==
{{see also|Planning permission}}
The responsibilities of an urban planner vary between [[jurisdictions]], and sometimes within jurisdictions. The following is therefore a general description of the responsibilities of an urban planner, of which an urban planner may well typically practice two or more of. An urban planner may also specialize in one responsibility only.
 
===Land use planning===

Urban planners specializing in [[land use planning]] are predominantly concerned with the regulation of [[land use]], [[Land development|development]] and [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]], with the intent of achieving the desired urban planning outcome.

Regulation of land use and development is achieved via the drafting and adoption of planning instruments designed to influence the land use and built form goals of the jurisdiction. The planning instruments take the form of legislation and policy, and have a wide variety of terms across jurisdictions including [[Primary and secondary legislation|acts and regulations]], rules, [[Code of law|codes]], schemes, plans, policies, and manuals; and often a combination of some of these. The planning instruments often spatially zone land or reserve the land for certain purposes, presented in the form of a [[Zoning|zoning map or plan]]. The urban planner is tasked with preparing planning instruments and zoning plans. Further, given urban development is rarely static and the goals of urban planning change from time to time, the urban planner will be responsible for continuously maintaining planning instruments and zoning plans to ensure they are kept up-to-date.

Consultation with the community and other stakeholders is generally desired by urban planners in most jurisdictions when planning instruments are prepared and updated. The level of consultation will vary depending on the project.

The urban planner will also be responsible for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the proposed subdivision of an allotment will be required to obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government).

While concerned with future development, an urban planner will occasionally be responsible for investigating development or land use which had been undertaken without authorization. In many jurisdictions urban planners can require that unauthorized land use cease and unauthorized development is returned to its predevelopment condition; or alternatively retrospectively approve the unauthorized development or land use.

===Strategic urban planning===

In order to plan effectively for long term development and growth, an urban planner will be responsible for the preparation of a strategic plan (also known in different jurisdictions by names such as [[development plan]], [[Core strategy document|core strategy]], [[Comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]], planning strategy, [[structure plan]], etc.). Strategic urban planning sets the high-level goals and growth principles for a jurisdiction, which will in turn inform the preparation and amendment of the legal planning instruments within that jurisdiction.

===Regional planning===
{{main|Regional planning}}
Regional planning deals with the planning of land use, infrastructure and settlement growth over a geographical area which extends to a whole city or beyond. In this sense, the urban planner's role is to consider urban planning at a macro scale. Regional planning is not concerned with planning at the local (neighborhood) level.

===Heritage and conservation===

An urban planner may be responsible for identifying, protecting and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conserving / restoring]] buildings and places which are identified by a community as having [[cultural heritage]] significance. This may include the task of compiling and maintaining a [[heritage register]], finding and making available incentives for encouraging conservation works, and the consideration of proposals to redevelop or use a heritage-listed place.

===Urban renewal===

As urban areas decline, an urban planner may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site, but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban renewal (or redevelopment) plan is prepared.

Urban renewal often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an area; the funding may be used for a variety of purposes such as improvement of public roads, parks and other public spaces, development of infrastructure, and acquisition of land. The urban planner will be responsible for costing an urban renewal plan and obtaining funding for infrastructure works necessary to implement the urban renewal plan.

The urban planner for an urban renewal project will need to liaise closely with stakeholders during the preparation and implementation of the plan, including government agencies, landowners and community groups.

===Master planning===

A master plan will be prepared for many [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] development projects. The purpose of a master plan is to plan for the ultimate spatial layout of the land uses for a future development area. A master plan will consider the required infrastructure to service the development and determine the need and location of urban amenities including commercial and industrial land, community facilities, schools, parks, public transport, major roads, and land uses, both within and outside the master plan area, and consider the staging of development of a master planned area.

The urban planner will be responsible for coordinating the various professional consultant inputs, and to lay out the master plan infrastructure and land uses. It will often be necessary for the urban planner to consult with landowners and government agencies affected by the master plan.

===Transportation planning===

An urban planner may be responsible for planning for [[transport]] facilities and infrastructure in urban and inter-regional areas.

===Economic development===

An urban planner's responsibility may extend to economic development. In this sense, an urban planner may be responsible for identifying opportunities for [[economic growth]], and encourage [[investment]] in an area.

===Environmental planning===

An urban planner may be concerned with the impact of land use, development and subdivision on the [[Natural resource|natural environment]] including land, water, flora, and fauna, to achieve [[sustainable]] outcomes.

===Urban design===

An urban planner will develop the design of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, etc.) and the relationship between built form and public spaces. Depending on the country and planner's training they may work with other design professionals such as civil engineers, architects or landscape architects to complete and construct the design.

===Infrastructure planning===

An urban planner may be required to plan for the future provision of [[public works]] [[infrastructure]] such as [[water supply]], [[sewerage]], [[electricity]], [[telecommunications]], and [[transport]] infrastructure, and community infrastructure including [[schools]], [[hospitals]] and [[parks]].

==Education and training==

''See [[Urban planning education]] for a discussion of this topic.''

Urban Planning as a profession is a relatively young discipline. Few government agencies restrict or license the profession. As a result, a number of other related disciplines actively claim to have the training, expertise and professional scope to practice urban planning. While organizations such as the [[American Planning Association]], the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] certify professional planners, others in related fields like [[Landscape Architecture]] also claim to have professional autonomy in urban planning. Efforts internationally have attempted to define the role of urban planners through licensure acts. The State of [[New Jersey]] licenses Professional Planners. The Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Alberta protect the title of [[Registered Professional Planner]] to only those who have an accredited CIP education and experience or equivalent.

==Urban planners by nation==

===Canada===

Urban planners in Canada usually hold bachelor's degrees in planning or a master's degree, typically accredited as an M.Pl, MUP (Master of Urban Planning) MCP (Master of City Planning), MScPl, MES (Master of Environmental Studies) or simply an MA.

===Greece===

Urban planners in [[Greece]] typically graduate from  [[Engineering]] faculties. [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] and [[University of Thessaly]] are the two universities that provide undergraduate studies in [[urban planning]] in [[Greece]].

===India===

Though planning is not a recognized profession under Indian law, the profession began in 1941 with the [[School of Planning and Architecture]] as a Department of Architecture of Delhi College of Engineering now the [[Delhi Technological University]]. It was later integrated with the School of Town and Country Planning which was established in 1955 by the [[Government of India]] to provide facilities for rural, urban and regional planning. On integration, the school was renamed as School of Planning and Architecture in 1959. Today, it is one of the premier schools of pursuing planning studies at bachelor, masters and post doctorate levels.

The [http://itpi.org.in/content/default.aspx Institute of Town Planners, India] (ITPI), set up on the lines of the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] in [[London]] is the body representing planning professionals in India. A small group formed itself into an Indian Board of Town Planners which after three years of continuous work formed the ITPI. The institute, which was established in July 1951, today, has a membership of over 2800, apart from a sizable number of student members, many of whom have qualified Associateship Examination (AITP) conducted by ITPI. As of 2012, the institute has 21 regional chapters across India.
School of Planning and Architecture(SPA),Delhi is one of the premier institute in dissemination knowledge of Architecture and Planning in India. It was established in 1941.In 1979, the Government of India, through the then Ministry of Education and Culture, conferred on the School of Planning and Architecture the status of "Deemed to be a University"(http://spa.ac.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)
[[School of Planning and Architecture-Bhopal]] (M.P.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spabhopal.ac.in/&lt;/ref&gt; and School of Planning and Architecture-Vijayawada established in year 2008 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
Centre for Environment Planning and Technology (CEPT) University [http://cept.ac.in] in Ahmedabad and Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (N.I.T) in Bhopal along with NIT Patna are one of the pioneering Institutes in India where urban planning is taught.

===Israel===

The [[Israel Planners Association]] was founded in 1965. Urban planning is taught by the [[Technion]] [http://architecture.technion.ac.il/en/ Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning] in [[Haifa]] and the [http://curs.net.technion.ac.il/ Center for Urban and Regional Studies].

===Mexico===

Urban planners in Mexico typically graduate from an Architecture background provided by major universities in the country. Most of such degrees can be awarded at Masters' graduate studies, although there are also bachelor's degrees available.

===New Zealand===

A planner brings professional expertise and knowledge to the development and implementation of policy in the interests of productive, liveable and sustainable environments. Planners support communities and provide leadership in making informed choices about the consequences of human actions and in bridging the gap between the present and the future. Planners must consider and balance a range of strategic, policy, technical, legal, administrative, community and environmental factors in their contributions to informed decision-making.

Planners are employed in diverse public and private roles. They use their knowledge and experience in various institutional and community settings to provide leadership, undertake research, solve problems, evaluate alternatives and outcomes, manage change, and envision, advise on and enact desirable future directions.

In applying their expertise, planners must be aware of and responsive to cultural, social, economic, environmental, ethical and political values. In New Zealand, these include the bicultural mandate for planning, including the partnership relationships established by the Treaty of Waitangi/te Tiriti o Waitangi, and New Zealand’s increasingly multicultural society.

A key attribute of a planner is the ability to work across disciplinary and institutional boundaries and to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines within the distinctive framework of the discipline of planning.

A professional planner is someone who has gained a professional qualification through tertiary study, continues to learn post qualification, undertakes continuing professional development, is a member or is working towards becoming a member of the [http://www.planning.org.nz/ New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI)], contributes to the planning profession, and is committed to upholding the principles and ethical practices of the planning profession.

===Nigeria===

In [[Nigeria]], the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP) and the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC) are the leading bodies tasked with the responsibility of improving the training, education and professional practice of planning in Nigeria.

To be a town planner in Nigeria, first must complete a degree in Urban and regional planning or a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in Urban and regional planning  which must be accredited by the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC ), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP), but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member, and subsequently register and sit for the TOPREC professional examination, to become a registered town planner.

===South Africa===

The [[South African Council for Planners]] ([http://www.sacplan.org.za SACPLAN]) is the statutory Council of nominated members appointed in terms of the Planning Profession Act, 2002 (Act 36 of 2002) by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform (Department of Rural Development and Land Reform) to regulate the Planning Profession(Planning is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan) in terms of the Act. The Planning Profession Principles applies to all registered planners. The SACPLAN through the Act assures quality in the planning profession through the identification of planning profession work that only registered planners can undertake. The functions of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 7 of the Act. The powers and duties of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 8 of the Act. The Act further prescribes a Professional Code of Conduct for registered planners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacplan.org.za|title=SACPLAN - SACPLAN|author=Administrator|work=sacplan.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Town planners in the UK are responsible for all aspects of the built environment, wherever you are within the UK a town and country planner will have at sometime planned the built aspects of the environment. They (Local Planning Authorities) grant planning permission (consent) to individuals, private builders and corporations and also aid local government with their decisions.

===United States===
Planners in the U.S. typically complete an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university offering the program of study.  Professional certification is only offered through the [[American Institute of Certified Planners]] (AICP), a branch of the [[American Planning Association]].  To gain AICP certification, a planner must meet specific educational and experience requirements, as well as pass an exam covering the nature and practice of the discipline.  Although AICP certification is not required to be a practicing planner, it does serve as a means in which a planner can verify his or her professional expertise.
