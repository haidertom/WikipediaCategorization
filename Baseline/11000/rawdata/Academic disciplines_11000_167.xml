      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6470">The '''AMD Platform Security Processor''' ('''PSP'''), officially known as '''AMD Secure Technology''', is a [[trusted execution environment]] subsystem incorporated since about 2013 into [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] microprocessors.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt; According to an AMD developer's guide, the subsystem is "responsible for creating, monitoring and maintaining the security environment" and "its functions include managing the boot process, initializing various security related mechanisms, and monitoring the system for any suspicious activity or events and implementing an appropriate response."&lt;ref name="AMD_2016"/&gt; Critics worry it can be used as a backdoor and is a security concern.&lt;ref name="Martin_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claburn_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larabel_2017"/&gt; AMD has denied requests to open source the code that runs on the PSP.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt;

The PSP is similar to the [[Intel Management Engine]] for Intel processors.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt;

==Details==
The PSP itself is an [[ARM core]] inserted on the main CPU die.&lt;ref name="Libreboot"/&gt;

==Security history==
In September 2017, Google security researcher Cfir Cohen reported a vulnerability to AMD of a PSP subsystem that could allow an attacker access to passwords, certificates, and other sensitive information; a patch was rumored to become available to vendors in December 2017.&lt;ref name="Millman_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cimpanu_2018"/&gt;

In March 2018, a handful of alleged serious flaws were announced in AMD's [[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen]] architecture CPUs ([[EPYC]], [[Ryzen]], Ryzen Pro, and Ryzen Mobile) by an Israeli [[IT security]] company related to the PSP that could allow malware to run and gain access to sensitive information.&lt;ref name="Goodin_2018"/&gt; AMD has announced firmware updates to handle these flaws.&lt;ref name="Bright_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Papermaster_2018"/&gt; While there were claims that the flaws were published for the purpose of [[Market manipulation|stock manipulation]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamersnexus.net/industry/3260-assassination-attempt-on-amd-by-viceroy-research-cts-labs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157242-amd-cts-labs-story-failed-stock-manipulation?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; their validity from a technical standpoint was upheld by independent security experts who reviewed the disclosures.&lt;ref name="trailofbits"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10724">'''Agricultural communication''' (or agricultural communications) is a field that focuses on communication about agriculture-related information among agricultural stakeholders and between agricultural and non-agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture is broadly defined in this discipline to include not only [[farming]], but also food, [[fiber]] (e.g., cotton), animals, rural issues, and [[natural resources]].&lt;ref&gt;Doerfert, D. L. (Ed.) (2011). National research agenda: American Association for Agricultural Education’s research priority areas for 2011-2015. Lubbock, TX: Texas Tech University, Department of 
Agricultural Education and Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural communication is done formally and informally by [[agricultural extension]] and is considered related to [[science communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Treise, D., &amp; Weigold, M. F. (2002). Advancing science communication: A survey of science communicators. ''Science Communication, 23''(3), 310-322.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has evolved into its own professional field.

By definition, agricultural communicators are science communicators that deal exclusively with the diverse, applied science and business that is agriculture. An agricultural communicator is "expected to bring with him or her a level of specialized knowledge in the agricultural field that typically is not required of the mass communicator".&lt;ref&gt;Boone, K., Meisenbach, T., &amp; Tucker, M. (2000). ''Agricultural communications: Changes and challenges'', Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural communication also addresses all subject areas related to the complex enterprises of food, feed, fiber, renewable energy, natural resource management, rural development and others, locally to globally. Furthermore, it spans all participants, from scientists to consumers - and all stages of those enterprises, from agricultural research and production to processing, marketing, consumption, nutrition and health.

A growing market for agricultural journalists and broadcasters led to the establishment of agricultural journalism and agricultural communication academic disciplines.

The job market for agricultural communicators includes:
*Farm broadcasting
*Journalists and editors of agricultural/rural magazines and newspapers
*Communication specialist or [[public relations]] practitioner for agricultural commodity organizations, businesses, non-profits
*Sales representative for agricultural business
*Science journalist
*[[Land-grant university]] communication specialist
*Public relations or advertising for firms that specialize in or have agricultural clients

== History ==
The academic field originated from communication courses that taught students in the agricultural sciences how to communicate. Originally, agricultural journalists were needed to report farm news for a much larger agricultural and rural audience. As people moved from the farm to cities and suburbs, a much greater proportion of the population had less direct knowledge and experience regarding agriculture. While a need still exists for agricultural journalists, an equal, if not greater need exists for agricultural communicators who can act as liaisons between an industry with deeply rooted traditions and values and a public with little to no understanding of how agriculture operates and why it is the way it is.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J. (2008). Agricultural Communication Oral History Project. ''Agricultural Communications Documentation Center.'' http://www.library.illinois.edu/funkaces/acdc/oralhistory/podcasts.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002073631/http://www.library.illinois.edu/funkaces/acdc/oralhistory/podcasts.html |date=2012-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The key journal in the field is the Journal of Applied Communications.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Applied Communications. http://journalofappliedcommunications.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have focused on a variety of areas examining consumer attitudes toward agricultural products and practices including [[genetic engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;Irani, T., Sinclair, J., &amp; O'Malley. (2002). The Importance of Being Accountable The Relationship between Perceptions of Accountability, Knowledge, and Attitude toward Plant Genetic Engineering. ''Science Communication, 23''(3). {{doi|10.1177/107554700202300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetically modified food]],&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, C. A., &amp; Miller, J. D. (2007). Selected Consumers’ Evaluations of Genetically Modified Food Labels. ''Journal of Applied Communications, 91''(1-2).&lt;/ref&gt; natural and [[organic food]] and production,&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, K. M., Meyers, C. A., &amp; Irani, T. A. (2009). Naturally confused: Consumers’ perceptions of organic and all-natural pork products. ''Journal of Agriculture and Human Values'' [in press]. {{doi|10.1007/s10460-009-9234-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and food-related risks.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, M., Whaley, S., &amp; Sharp, J. (2006). Consumer perceptions of food-related risks. ''International Journal of Food Science and Technology, 41''(2), 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of research has been media coverage of agriculture and agricultural issues. Topics have included media coverage of [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease),&lt;ref&gt;Ruth, A., Eubanks, E., &amp; Telg, R. (2005). Framing of Mad Cow Media Coverage. ''Journal of Applied Communications, 89''(4) 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashlock, M., Cartmell, D., &amp; Kelemen, D. (2006). The Cow That Stole Christmas: Framing the First U.S. Mad Cow Crisis. ''Journal of Applied Communications, 90''(2) 29-46.&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube videos of [[California Proposition 2 (2008)]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, J., &amp; Rhoades, E. (2009).

The Agricultural Communications Documentation Center,&lt;ref&gt;Agricultural Communications Documentation Center. http://www.library.illinois.edu/funkaces/acdc&lt;/ref&gt; maintained by the [[University of Illinois]], compiles research and articles related to agriculture and communications as well.

==Agricultural press and media==

There is a wide variety of [[:Category:Agricultural magazines|agricultural newspapers and magazines]] throughout the world. Radio programmes are frequently used for agricultural communication and [[Farm Radio International]] is a leading organization in providing programming to developing countries.

== Academic Programs ==
Several colleges offer formal education at the undergraduate and graduate levels in the field of agricultural communication. What follows is a list with links directly to the programs.

== Approaches to Agricultural Communication ==
Theoretically speaking, agricultural communication is an applied theoretical field. The academic curriculum and scholarly endeavors typically stay within the context of agriculture, natural resources, and occasionally, the life sciences. It examines communication and human dimension issues as they relate to a variety of issues in agriculture and natural resources. Agricultural journalism is not always differentiated from agricultural communications in research. One could argue that when research focuses on media coverage of agricultural issues or when it examines issues within agricultural journalism specifically (i.e., what influences editors of agriculture magazines to publish risk information), then it is more within the realm of agricultural journalism. Journalism is often seen as a subset of communication that is supposed to be fair and balanced like traditional journalism, whereas the broader field of agricultural communication could potentially be viewed as advocacy communication.

Agricultural communicators are expected to have a certain amount of knowledge and familiarity with agriculture. One could also add to that definition and say the communicator also brings with him or her an appreciation, or even affection, for the agriculture industry. While this is also probably true of agricultural journalists, they at least need to be cognizant of their potential bias to ensure they ask critical questions and present unbiased information. Agricultural journalists are trained like traditional journalists, but bring with them an understanding of agricultural systems and science either through experience and/or academic training.

'''Ahmad bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' was a Muslim traditionist and scholar of [[Hadith]] from Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ghumari was born on the 27th of [[Ramadan]] in 1320 according to the [[Islamic calendar]], corresponding to December 26, 1902 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; He was the older brother of fellow clerics [[Abdullah al-Ghumari]] and [[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]]. As a child, he studied in Morocco's traditional [[madrasa]] system, [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorizing]] the entire [[Qur'an]] by heart, in addition to traditional Islamic texts such as [[Alfiya]], [[Ajārūmīya]] and [[Bulugh al-Maram]].

In 1921, he traveled to [[Egypt]] and enrolled in [[Al-Azhar University]], returning to Morocco upon the death of his father.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari went to Egypt a second time in 1931 when his younger brothers Abdullah and Muhammad also enrolled in the university. Due to fears regarding activity of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt, his brother Abdullah was sentenced to ten years in prison on accusations of ties to the group in 1961. Ahmad al-Ghumari, upon hearing the news of his younger brother's long sentence, fell ill and died eight months later.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Career==
Ghumari was a prolific writer, having authored more than one-hundred books. He was well known for a debate which acrimoniously began between him and fellow hadith scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]], and later continued with between Ghumari's younger brother Abdullah and Albani.&lt;ref name=moin&gt;Muhammad Moin, [http://alsonnah.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/ahmed-al-ghumari-on-al-albani/ "Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani"]. ''Al-Sunnah'': 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the older Ghumari's attestation to Albani's high level of knowledge and respected status in [[Hadith studies]], the nature of the debate between them became personal and involved character attacks.

Like the rest of his family, Ghumari was a leader of the [[Siddiqiyya]] Sufi [[Tariqa|order]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]], ''Ma Yajuz wa ma la Yajuz fi al-Hayat al-Zawjiyyah'', pg. 9. Amman: Dar al-Fath, 2009. {{ISBN|9789957231309}}&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of the larger [[Shadhili]] order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] claimed that al-Ghumari had chosen to live a very simple life and eschewed material excess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hassan Kettani]], ''Fiqh al-Hafizh Ahmad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari'', pg. 58. [[Amman]]: Dar al-Bayariq, 2001. Jordanian National Library #2001/6/1146&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a practitioner of [[Sufism]], Ghumari was a strong critic of many Sufis, especially the rival [[Naqshbandi]] [[Tariqa|order]].&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Ibn Hazm]], Ghumari viewed scholarly [[Ikhtilaf|difference of opinion]] as a curse. Like his brothers, he often used harsh language when responding to intellectual opponents.&lt;ref name=moin/&gt;&lt;ref name=haddad/&gt; Having originally followed the [[Maliki]] [[Madhhab|school of thought]] like most of Muslim scholarship in Morocco, al-Ghumari later switched to the [[Shafi'i]] school for a period and finally opted for absolute [[Ijtihad|independent reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pgs. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of Moroccan scholarship, al-Ghumari opposed the [[Ash'ari]] school of theology.&lt;ref name =kett62&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Abu Khubza]], among other Moroccan scholars, also claim that al-Ghumari temporarily adhered to the [[Zaidiyyah]] school of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name =kett62/&gt;

'''Alessandro Longo''' (31 December 1864 – 3 November 1945) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[composer]] and [[musicology|musicologist]].

==Early life==
Longo was born in [[Amantea]]. After studying at the [[Music conservatories of Naples|Naples Conservatory]] under [[Beniamino Cesi]] (and composition under [[Paolo Serrao]]), he began teaching [[piano]] at his [[alma mater]] in 1887, deputizing for Cesi as pianoforte professor, and succeeded him in 1897.

==Career==
As a pianist, Longo often played in chamber ensemble with the Ferni Quartet, and with the Quartetto Napoletano (with Cantani, Parmiciano, Scarano and Viterbini). He founded various musical institutions in Naples, and gained a high reputation as a concert pianist. In 1914 he began editing the review ''L'Arte Pianistica''.&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph derived from [[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]], ''A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians'' (Dent, London 1924), 87, 303-304.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Director of the Naples Conservatory in 1944, and died in [[Naples]] the following year, aged 80.

==Legacy==
Today, Longo is mainly remembered for compiling an almost comprehensive catalogue of the [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] works of [[Domenico Scarlatti]].  For many years, [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas]] were conventionally identified by their Longo numbers, but these were later superseded by those found in [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]]'s catalogue. Longo's Catalogue originated in his landmark full publication of the works of Scarlatti in 11 volumes&lt;ref&gt;A. Longo, ''545 Scarlatti Sonatas in XI Volumes'' (Ricordi, 1906-1913).&lt;/ref&gt; and implied particular groupings of the sonatas, the chronology of which was later completely revised and differently grouped in Kirkpatrick's 1953 study of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kirkpatrick, ''Domenico Scarlatti'' (Princeton University Press, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; Longo also edited works by [[Domenico Gallo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permanent Link to Catalog Card Entry for Gallo Sonata, attributed to Pergolesi, as Arranged by Longo|publisher=Cornell University|url=https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=2004985&amp;DB=local|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His compositions include, among others, two works for piano four-hands, a serenade and a suite;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGraw|first=Cameron|title=Piano Duet Repertoire: Music Originally Written for One Piano, Four Hands|year=1981|pages=174|isbn=0-253-21461-0|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|

Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with [[Williams College]] and [[Wesleyan University]] which form the [[Little Three]] colleges. The college is a member of the [[Five College Consortium]], which allows its students to attend classes at four other [[Pioneer Valley]] institutions: [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].

==History==

=== Founding and 19th century ===

Founded in 1821, Amherst College developed out of the secondary school Amherst Academy. The college was originally suggested as an alternative to [[Williams College]], which was struggling to stay open. Although Williams remained open, Amherst was formed and diverged from its Williams roots into an individual institution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/facts/history|title=History of Amherst {{!}} Amherst College|website=www.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, funds were raised in Amherst for a secondary school, Amherst Academy; it opened December 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofamhers00tyle#page/34/mode/2up History of Amherst College during its first half century 1821-1871]. Archive.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The academy incorporated in 1816.&lt;ref name=Adams1853&gt;{{cite book|title= Massachusetts Register |year=1853 |author=George Adams |location=Boston |publisher=Printed by Damrell and Moore |chapter=Education in Massachusetts: Incorporated Academies |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=MScDAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery, Lord Amherst]], a veteran from the [[Seven Years' War]] and later commanding general of the British forces in North America. On November 18, 1817, a project was adopted at the Academy to raise funds for the free instruction of "indigent young men of promising talents and hopeful piety, who shall manifest a desire to obtain a liberal education with a sole view to the Christian ministry."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|title=A History of Amherst College (1894) -- Chapter 1|website=www3.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220193925/http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|archive-date=December 20, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This required a substantial investment from benefactors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the fundraising for the project, it became clear that without larger designs, it would be impossible to raise sufficient funds. This led the committee overseeing the project to conclude that a new institution should be created. On August 18, 1818, the Amherst Academy board of trustees accepted this conclusion and began building a new college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Establishment===
Moore, then [[List of Williams College presidents|President of Williams College]], however, still believed that [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] was an unsuitable location for a college, and with the advent of Amherst College was elected its first president on May 8, 1821. At its opening, Amherst had forty-seven students. Fifteen of these had followed Moore from Williams College. Those fifteen represented about one-third of the whole number at Amherst, and about one-fifth of the whole number in the three classes to which they belonged in Williams College. President Moore died on June 29, 1823, and was replaced with a Williams College trustee, [[Heman Humphrey]]. Williams alumni are fond of an apocryphal story ascribing the removal of books from the Williams College library to Amherst College.&lt;ref&gt;[https://specialcollections.williams.edu/williams-history/groups/theft-of-the-williams-library/ Griffin D, The Theft of the Williams Library]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Williams president [[Harry C. Payne]] declared the story false, but many still nurture the legend.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Amherst grew quickly, and for two years in the mid-1830s it was the second largest college in the United States, second only to [[Yale College|Yale]]. In 1835, Amherst attempted to create a course of study parallel to the classical liberal arts education. This parallel course focused less on [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], instead focusing on [[English studies|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], etc. The parallel course did not take hold, however, until the next century.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Amherst was founded as a non-sectarian institution "for the classical education of indigent young men of piety and talents for the Christian ministry," (Tyler, ''A History of Amherst College''). One of the hallmarks of the new college was its Charity Fund, an early form of financial aid that paid the tuition of poorer students.&lt;ref name="NEcollege"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claude Moore Feuss|title=Amherst: Story of a New England College}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially non-denominational, the initial Amherst was considered a religiously conservative institution with a strong connection to [[Calvinism]], and as a result, there was considerable debate in the Massachusetts government over whether the new college should receive an official charter from the state, and a charter was not granted until February 21, 1825.&lt;ref name="NEcollege" /&gt; As a result of the official charter being granted four years after the official founding of the college, the Amherst seal lists a date of 1825. Religious conservatism persisted at Amherst until the mid-nineteenth century: students who consumed alcohol or played cards were subject to expulsion, and there were a number of [[Christian revival#United States 1800–1850|religious revival]]s at Amherst where mobs of righteous students would herd less religious students into the chapel and berate them for lack of piety.&lt;ref name="NEcollege" /&gt; Towards the end of the nineteenth century, however, the college began a transition towards secularism, culminating in the demolishing of the college church in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley King|title="The Consecrated Eminence": The Story of the Campus and Buildings of Amherst College |location=Amherst, Mass. |publisher=Amherst College |year=1951 |origyear=1952 |oclc=2747723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development and academic reform ===

Academic hoods in the United States are traditionally lined with the official colors of the school, in theory so watchers can tell where the hood wearer earned his or her degree. Amherst's hoods are purple (Williams' official color) with a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. Amherst records one of the first uses of [[Latin honors]] of any American college, dating back to 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0450/ChairsUpdateWebReady5-29-07.pdf |title=Annual Fund Update |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |website=Amherst College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124931/https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0450/ChairsUpdateWebReady5-29-07.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was an all-male school until the late 1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Five-College Consortium attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty voted in favor of coeducation and in November 1974 the board of trustees voted to admit female students starting in the 1975-1976 school year. In 1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college exchange program were admitted as transfer students.

In July 2007, Amherst announced that grants would replace loans in all financial aid packages beginning in the 2008-09 academic year. Amherst had already been the first school to eliminate loans for low-income students, and with this announcement it joined [[Princeton University]], [[Cornell University]] and [[Davidson College]], then the only colleges to completely eliminate loans from need-based financial aid packages.

=== Academic freedom debate ===
The writings of Amherst College political science Professor [[Hadley Arkes]] about homosexuality led to a dispute in 2013 over whether a college seeking to create a diverse, respectful academic community should speak out when a faculty member disparages community members or should instead remain silent as a way to protect academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmag.com/2015/04/hadley_arkes_the_right_stuff|title=WORLD {{!}} Hadley Arkes: The right stuff {{!}} Marvin Olasky {{!}} April 18, 2015|website=WORLD|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue arose when a group of alumni petitioned the college trustees and President [[Carolyn Martin|Biddy Martin]] to "dissociate the institution" from Arkes's "divisive and destructive" views,&lt;ref name="terrasirradient.org"&gt;[http://terrasirradient.org/2013/10/18/petition-to-cullen-murphy-chair-of-amherst-college-board-of-trustees/ Petition to the Amherst College board of trustees | Amherst Against Homophobia].

Martin disagreed, citing past debates over the college's position on the Vietnam War and apartheid in South Africa—issues on which the college initially remained silent but eventually took a public position. In such times, she said, colleges should "avoid taking institutional positions on controversial political matters, except in extraordinary circumstances" and should simultaneously both "protect their communities from discrimination and disrespect" and "cherish a diversity of viewpoints."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/president/reflections President's Reflections | Amherst College].

After a complaint was filed by Epifano and an anonymous former student in November 2013,&lt;ref name=Mishkin&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishkin|first=Shaina and Daniel Rodriguez|title=Amherst College facing 2 sexual assault complaints|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/11/16/students-file-federal-complaint-against-amherst-college-alleging-mishandling-sexual-assaults/cxRn6t3sWaGKOVBK3hbg5N/story.html|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US Department of Education opened an investigation into the college's handling of sexual violence and potential violations of [[Title IX]]. In May 2014, the Department of Education announced a list of 55 colleges and universities (including Amherst) currently under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/federal-government-releases-list-of-55-colleges-universities-under-title-ix-investigations-over-handling-of-sexual-violence/2014/05/01/e0a74810-d13b-11e3-937f-d3026234b51c_story.html |title=55 colleges under Title IX probe for handling of sexual violence and harassment claims |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=1 May 2014 |last=Anderson |first=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from Amherst College stated that 2009 to 2011, Amherst reported 35 instances of "forcible sex offenses", a term that encompasses rape, attempted rape, and lesser forms of sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/122491/original/Clery%20Report%202008.pdf "Amherst College Police: Annual Report, Calendar Year 2011"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215901/https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/122491/original/Clery%20Report%202008.pdf |date=April 8, 2014 }}.

In December 2015, a lawsuit against Amherst College was filed alleging that "teaching assistants [...] were encouraged to sleep with and socialize with students to boost enrollment in the Spanish department."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Lawsuit claims teaching assistants at Amherst were told to sleep with students to boost enrollment|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/29/lawsuit-claims-teaching-assistants-at-amherst-were-told-to-sleep-with-students-to-boost-class-enrollment/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-12-29 |accessdate=2015-12-31|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Susan|last = Svrluga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Login {{!}} Gazettenet.com|url = http://www.gazettenet.com/home/20256874-95/former-spanish-lecturer-sues-amherst-college-claiming-supervisor-urged-assistants-to-sleep-with-stud|website = www.gazettenet.com|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Former Spanish lecturer sues Amherst College over dismissal|url = http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2015/12/former_spanish_lecturer_sues_amherst_college_over_dismissal |accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-Amherst College lecturer files lawsuit alleging teaching assistants encouraged to sleep with students to boost enrollment |url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/amherst_college_suing_college.html|website = masslive.com|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mascot====
The original unofficial mascot of Amherst College, Lord Jeffrey Amherst, was a cause of concern in the Amherst community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corey|first=Ethan|title=College Weighs Tradition and Inclusivity in Mascot Debate|url=http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2013/04/03/college-weighs-tradition-and-inclusivity-mascot-debate|accessdate=25 May 2014 |newspaper=The Amherst Student|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sought to separate the school from the problematic legacy of Lord Jeffrey Amherst, in particular his advocacy of the use of [[biological warfare]] against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=d'Errico|first=Peter|title=Jeffrey Amherst and Smallpox Blankets|url=http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/lord_jeff.html|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, after a wild moose found its way onto the Amherst College campus and into the backyard of the house of the college president,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merzbach|first=Scott|title=Wandering Moose Creates a Stir in Amherst, prompts tweet from Amherst College President Biddy Martin|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/home/11984581-95/wandering-moose-creates-a-stir-in-amherst-prompts-tweets-from-amherst-college-president-biddy|accessdate=25 May 2014|newspaper=[[Daily Hampshire Gazette]]|location=[[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton, Mass.]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; students organized a Facebook campaign to change the mascot of the school to a moose.&lt;ref name=Bullwinkle /&gt; The page grew rapidly in popularity, receiving over 900 "likes" in under two weeks,&lt;ref name=Bullwinkle /&gt; and inspiring both a Twitter and Tumblr account for the newly proposed mascot. At the Commencement ceremony for the class of 2014, the moose mascot was mentioned by Biddy Martin in her address, and the Dining Hall served Moose Tracks ice cream in front of an ice sculpture of a moose.&lt;ref&gt;[//scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/59303_10203747867714073_6503822668927316018_n.jpg Photo of ice sculpture of moose.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, discussion of a mascot change continued when the editorial board of the ''Amherst Student'', the college's official student-run newspaper, came out in favor of "the moose-scot".&lt;ref name=Bullwinkle&gt;{{cite web|title=Moose-scot: A Call to Arms |work=Amherst Student |url=http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article%2F2015%2F02%2F04%2Fmoose-scot-call-arms||date=4 February 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 the student body and the faculty overwhelmingly voted to vacate the mascot; the decision to drop the mascot was made official on January 26, 2016 after student anti-racism protests on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Glaun |first=Dan|title=Amherst College trustees vote to drop controversial Lord Jeff mascot |url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/01/amherst_college_trustees_vote.html|accessdate=26 January 2016|newspaper=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Springfield (Mass.)

In April 2017, Amherst announced that their official mascot would be the [[Mammoth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/03/after-sending-lord-jeff-packing-amherst-college-picks-mammoth-mascot/2pT6Etr7n1jrjCwFRANK8M/story.html|title=After sending Lord Jeff packing, Amherst College picks mammoth as mascot|last=Rosen|first=Andy|date=3 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP004&gt;Boswell, Thomas.

==Athletics==
More than one-third of Amherst's student body participates in sports at the intercollegiate level, and eighty percent participate in intramural and club sports teams.&lt;ref name="ath" /&gt; Amherst participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]], the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]], and the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]], which includes [[Bates College|Bates]], [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]], [[Colby College|Colby]], [[Connecticut College]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity]], [[Tufts University|Tufts]], [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], and [[Williams College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nescac.com/landing/index|title=NESCAC|website=www.nescac.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amherst is also one of the "[[Little Three]]," along with Williams and Wesleyan. A Little Three champion is informally recognized by most teams based on the head-to-head records of the three schools, but three-way competitions are held in some of the sports.

Amherst claims its athletics program as the oldest in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://cms.amherst.edu/athletics/quickfacts Amherst College and Amherst Athletics Quickfacts]", amherst.edu . Retrieved October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to its compulsory physical fitness regimen put in place in 1860 (the mandate that all students participate in sports or pursue physical education has been discontinued).&lt;ref name="tyler"&gt;"[http://www.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter12/menu.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307142220/http://www.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter12/menu.html |date=March 7, 2008 }}", ''A History of Amherst College During the Administrations of its First Five Presidents.''&lt;/ref&gt; Amherst and Williams played the first [[college baseball]] game July 2, 1859.&lt;ref name="baseballgame"&gt;{{cite news |first = Gordon|last = Edes|title = Amherst and Williams re-enact first college game|date = May 4, 2009|publisher = [[Yahoo!

Amherst's growing athletics program has been the subject of controversy in recent years due to dramatic contrasts between the racial and socioeconomic makeup of its student athletes and the rest of its student body, the clustering of athletes in particular academic departments, and a perceived "divide" on campus between varsity athletes and other students. Athletic skill plays a factor in the admissions decisions of between 28% and 35% of each incoming class.&lt;ref name="ath"&gt;"[http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2017/02/08/college-releases-report-state-athletics-program]", The Amherst Student.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this divide is caused by the fact that many social events are organized by teams, with the first hour or so of the party open only to team members before allowing in invited guests, basically reproducing the social segmentation the college hoped to avoid with the elimination of fraternities in the 1980s.{{fact|date=October 2018}}  

Amherst fields several club athletic teams, including [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[soccer]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[rugby union]], [[water polo]], [[Equestrianism|equestrian]], [[mountain biking]], [[fencing]], [[sailing]] and [[skiing]]. [[Intramural sports]] include soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, volleyball and softball.

The sport of Ultimate was started and named at Amherst College in the mid-1960s by Jared Kass.&lt;ref name=herndon&gt;{{cite web|title=This is How it All Began: An Interview with Jared Kass |date=August 30, 2003 |first=Willie |last=Herndon |origyear=Winter 2003 |url=http://www.ultimatehalloffame.org/sportstories/august.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107075156/http://www.ultimatehalloffame.org/sportstories/august.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |work=ultimatehalloffame.org |format=reprinted with permission |publisher=Originally published in the [[USA Ultimate|Ultimate Players Association]] newsletter |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/origins-and-development-ultimate-frisbee |title=The Origins and Development of Ultimate Frisbee |author=Gerald Griggs |year=2009 |accessdate=January 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229214400/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/origins-and-development-ultimate-frisbee |archivedate=December 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body-on-frame''' is an [[automobile]] construction method where a separate [[coachwork|body]] is mounted on a relatively rigid [[vehicle frame|frame]] or [[chassis]] carrying the [[Powertrain|engine and drivetrain]]. The original method of building automobiles, body-on-frame construction is now used mainly for [[pickup trucks]] and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]].

In the late 19th century the frames, like those of the carriages they replaced, might be made of wood (commonly [[ash tree|ash]]), reinforced by steel flitch plates - but in the early 20th century steel [[vehicle frame#Ladder frame|ladder frames]] or chassis rapidly became standard. Mass production of all-metal bodies began with the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Dodge Brothers]]. Mass production of all-metal bodies became general in the 1920s but Europe, with exceptions, followed almost a decade later. Europe's custom-made or "coachbuilt" cars usually contained some wood framing or used aluminium alloy castings.

[[Unibody]] or [[monocoque]] designs, where panels within the body supported the car on its suspension, were developed by European manufacturers in the late 1920s with Budd USA (which had a number of large factories in Europe) and its technical knowhow; but not in USA until the 1950s and generally later. Because of the high cost of designing and developing these structures and the high cost of specialised machinery to make the large pressings required by this style of construction it is not used by low-volume manufacturers, who might construct an equivalent by welding steel tube to form a suitable space frame.

The [[Ford Model T]] carried the tradition of body-on-frame over from horse-drawn buggies, helping to facilitate high volume manufacturing on a moving assembly line.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304178104579538081576326194?ref=SB10001424052702304677904579535612915387656 Great Moments in Body-on-Frame Car Construction] WSJ, May 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA the frequent changes in [[automotive design]] made it necessary to use a ladder frame rather than unibody construction to make it possible to change the design without having to change the [[chassis]], allowing frequent changes and improvements to the car's bodywork and interior (where they were most noticeable to customers) while leaving the chassis and driveline unchanged, and thus keeping costs down and design times short. It was also easy to use the same chassis and driveline for several very different cars. Especially in the days before [[computer-aided design]], this was a big advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KJI/is_2_115/ai_97872909 |title=Framing the question &amp;#124; Automotive Design &amp; Production &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |first=Christopher A. |last=Sawyer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211205129/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KJI/is_2_115/ai_97872909 |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most small passenger vehicles switched to [[Vehicle frame#Types|unibody]] construction by the end of the 1930s. The trend had started with cars like the [[Citroen Traction Avant]] (1934) and [[Opel Olympia]] (a [[General Motors]] design) introduced in 1935. [[Truck]]s,  [[bus manufacturing|bus manufacturers]] and large low volume cars or those made in USA continued to use separate bodies on "conventional" frames. Body-on-frame remains the preferred construction method for heavy-duty commercial vehicles (especially those intended to carry or pull heavy loads, such as trucks and some [[sport utility vehicles]] (SUVs)) but as production volumes rise increasing numbers of SUVs and [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUVs]] are switching to [[unibody]] frames. Mass-market manufacturers [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] are abandoning true body-on-frame SUVs, opting, when sales volume permits, for more efficient unibody construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=7bdff2c1-c41c-4a71-bc48-bbf244f419d1|title=Car Reviews, New and Used Car Prices, Photos and Videos - MSN Autos|author=|date=|website=editorial.autos.msn.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota]] currently manufactures the most body-on-frame SUVs with the [[Toyota 4Runner|4Runner]], [[Toyota Sequoia|Sequoia]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Land Cruiser]], [[Lexus GX]] and [[Lexus LX|LX]] followed by [[Nissan]] with the [[Nissan Patrol|Patrol]], [[Nissan Armada|Armada]], and [[Infiniti QX80|Infiniti QX56/80]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/07/29/toyota-reaffirms-commitment-to-body-on-frame-suvs/|title=Toyota reaffirms commitment to body-on-frame SUVs|author=|date=|website=autoblog.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]], which was discontinued in 2011, was the last series of traditional passenger cars to be built in this manner.

One variant used by Chevrolet for its Corvette incorporates the inner skeleton to the frame.

An intermediate to full [[monocoque]] construction was the '[[semi-monocoque]]' used by the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and [[Renault 4]]. These used a lightweight separate chassis made from pressed sheet steel panels forming a 'platform chassis', to give the benefits of a traditional chassis, but with lower weight and greater stiffness. Both of these chassis were used for several different models. The mid-1930s designed Volkswagen made use of the bodyshell for structural strength as well as the chassis — hence 'semi-monocoque'. Traditionally chassis had "compliance", they were designed to allow some twisting. As suspensions improved they could not perform correctly unless supporting a rigid structure like that intended to be provided by unibody or monocoque construction.

The [[Lincoln Town Car]] once dominated the American limousine market because it was the last American luxury car made on the body-on-frame system and it was easily lengthened for livery work. With the Town Car discontinued since 2011, the de facto replacement is the Lincoln Navigator SUV.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}

===Advantages===

* Easier to design, build and modify. (partly due to today's computer-aided design (CAD) for coach-built vehicles in particular)
* Less noise while travelling, because the groans squeaks and rattles normally associated with bodywork movement due to stresses and strains are not heard so much, and road noise from tyres is more 'distant', all due to the bodywork being isolated from the chassis by rubber pads around the attachment bolts, or by suspending the body on the chassis.
* Easier to repair after accidents. This is crucial for first responders (police, fire, EMS) and anyone who needs their vehicle to earn a living. Damaged bolt-on wings, bumpers etc.: can be replaced easily, and in the case of a 'working vehicle' they can be returned to earning status almost immediately. A monocoque (one piece) vehicle shell would need specialist repairs, which could mean long delays before the vehicle is usable again.
* Can allow more torsional flexing before yielding (trucks, truck-base SUVs, off roading) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web2carz.com/autos/car-tech/2332/body-on-frame-vs-unibody-construction|title=Body-on-Frame vs. Unibody Construction - Web2Carz|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=web2carz.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vehicles mounted high on a separate chassis such as trucks and true off-road SUVs are less likely to suffer damage from rust caused by dampness, mud, stones, road grit, water, snow, and other more serious damage like the transmission or engine oil sump damage often caused by rocks.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Disadvantages===
* The complete vehicle will often be heavier than a monocoque shell, resulting in diminished performance and higher fuel consumption.
* Body-on-frame vehicles with high ground clearance such as trucks and true off-road SUVs have high centers of gravity, compromising their on-road performance. 
* Torsional flexing during cornering can compromise the handling and road grip.
* Many older body-on-frame vehicles have no inbuilt crumple zones, so their [[crashworthiness]] is below that of a monocoque shell with crumple zones.

'''Chemical tests in mushroom identification''' are methods that aid in determining the variety of some fungi.  The most useful tests are [[Melzer's reagent]] and [[potassium hydroxide]].

== Ammonia ==

Household [[ammonia]] can be used. A couple of drops are placed on the flesh.  For example, ''[[Boletus spadiceus]]'' gives a fleeting blue to blue-green reaction.

== Iron salts ==

Iron salts are used commonly in ''[[Russula]]'' and [[Bolete]] identification. It is best to dissolve the salts in water (typically a 10% solution) and then apply to the [[trama (mycology)|flesh]], but it is sometimes possible to apply the dry salts directly to see a color change.  For example, the white flesh of ''[[Boletus chrysenteron]]'' stains lemon-yellow or olive. Three results are expected with the iron salts tests: no change indicates a negative reaction; a color change to olive, green or blackish green; or a color change to reddish-pink.&lt;ref name=Ammirati1985&gt;{{cite book |title=Poisonous Mushrooms of Canada|vauthors=Ammirati J, Traquair JA, Horgen PA |year=1985|publisher=Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside in cooperation with Agriculture Canada|location= |isbn=978-0-88902-977-4|oclc= |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meixner test for amatoxins ==

The Meixner test (also known as the Wieland test) uses concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] and newspaper to test for the deadly [[amatoxin]]s found in some species of ''[[Amanita]]'', ''[[Lepiota]]'', and ''[[Galerina]]''.  The test yields false positives for some compounds, such as [[psilocin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15278082|year=2004|last1=Beuhler|first1=M|last2=Lee|first2=DC|last3=Gerkin|first3=R|title=The Meixner test in the detection of alpha-amanitin and false-positive reactions caused by psilocin and 5-substituted tryptamines|volume=44|issue=2|pages=114–20|doi=10.1016/S0196064404002860|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Melzer's reagent ==

[[Melzer's reagent]] can be used to test whether spores are [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], [[nonamyloid]], or [[dextrinoid]].

* Spores that stain bluish-gray to bluish-black are amyloid
* Spores that stain brown to reddish-brown are dextrinoid

This test is normally performed on white spored mushrooms.  If the spores are not light colored, a change will not be readily apparent.  It is easiest to see the color change under a microscope, but it is possible to see it with the naked eye with a good spore print.

== Paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde ==

In the [[genus]] ''[[Lyophyllum]]'' the [[Lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] usually turn blue with the application of [[para-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde]] (PDAB or pDAB).

== Phenol ==

A 2–3% aqueous solution of [[phenol]] gives a color change in some species when applied to the cap or stem.

== Potassium hydroxide ==

A 3–10% solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) gives a color change in some species of mushrooms:
* In ''[[Agaricus]]'', some species such as ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus|A. xanthodermus]]'' turn yellow with KOH, many have no reaction, and ''[[Agaricus subrutilescens|A. subrutilescens]]'' turns green.
* Distinctive change occurs for some species of ''[[Cortinarius]]'' and [[Boletes]]

== Schaeffer reaction ==

Developed by [[Julius Schäffer]] to help with the identification of ''[[Agaricus]]'' species. A positive reaction of Schaeffer's test, which uses the reaction of [[aniline]] and [[nitric acid]] on the surface of the mushroom, is indicated by an orange to red color; it is characteristic of species in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Flavescentes''. The compounds responsible for the reaction were named schaefferal A and B to honor Schäffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kileci-Ksoll R, Winklhoer C, Steglich W |title=Synthesis of schaefferals A and B, unusual phenylhydrazine derivatives from mushrooms of the genus ''Agaricus'' |journal=Synthesis |year=2010 |volume=13 |pages=2287–91 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1218790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two intersecting lines are drawn on the surface of the cap, the first with aniline or aniline water, the second with an [[aqueous solution]] of 65% nitric acid. The test is considered positive when a bright orange color forms where the lines cross.&lt;ref name=fdh&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hui |first1=Y. H. |last2=Smith |first2=R. A. |last3=Spoerke, Jr. |first3=David G. |date=2000 |title=Foodborne Disease Handbook, Second Edition: Volume 3: Plant Toxicants |publisher=CRC Press |page=745 |isbn=978-0824703431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmp&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spoerke |first1=David G. |last2=Rumack |first2=Barry H. |date=1994 |title=Handbook of Mushroom Poisoning: Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=CRC Press |page=146 |isbn=978-0849301940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bresinsky |first1=A |last2=Besl |first2=H |date=1990 |title=A Colour Atlas Of Poisonous Fungi: A Handbook for Pharmacists, Doctors, and Biologists |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0723415763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Agaricus placomyces]]'' and ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]'' produce false negative reactions.&lt;ref name=fdh /&gt;&lt;ref name=hmp /&gt;

Sometimes referred to as "Schaeffer's reaction", "Schaeffer's cross reaction" or "Schaeffer's test".

== Sulfo-vanillin ==

Made from [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[vanillin]] (vanilla).  Used in ''[[Russula]]'' and ''[[Panaeolus]]'' identification.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
{{aquatic layer topics}}
A '''chemocline''' is a [[Cline (hydrology)|cline]] caused by a strong, vertical [[chemistry]] gradient within a body of [[water]]. A chemocline is analogous to a [[thermocline]], the border at which warmer and cooler waters meet in an ocean, sea, lake, or other body of water. (In some cases, the thermocline and chemocline coincide.)

Chemoclines most commonly occur where local conditions favor the formations of anoxic bottom water &amp;mdash; deep water deficient in [[oxygen]], where only [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] forms of life can exist. The [[Black Sea]] is the classic example of such a body, though similar bodies of water (classified as [[meromictic]] lakes) exist across the globe. [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] life is restricted to the region above the chemocline, anaerobic below. Photosynthetic forms of anaerobic [[bacteria]], like green phototrophic and [[purple sulfur bacteria]], cluster at the chemocline, taking advantage of both the sunlight from above and the [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) produced by the anaerobic bacteria below.

In any body of water in which oxygen-rich surface waters are well-mixed ([[holomictic]]), no chemocline will exist. To cite the most obvious example, the Earth's global ocean has no chemocline.

==Types of clines==
* [[Thermocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[temperature]]
* [[Halocline]]  - A cline based on difference in water [[salinity]]
* [[Pycnocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[density]]

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

'''Criminalization''' or '''criminalisation''', in [[criminology]], is "the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into [[crime]] and criminals".&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by [[legislation]] or judicial decision. However, there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of [[statutory interpretation]] against the [[Ex post facto law|retrospective application of laws]] and only the use of express words by the legislature may rebut this presumption. The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged. In a less overt way, where laws have not been strictly enforced, the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo ''de facto'' criminalization through more effective or committed legal enforcement.

==The problems==
There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime. But, as Garkawe (2001) indicates, the relationship between [[victimology]] and [[criminology]] has become problematic. The concern is that, within the [[dialectic]] of [[Right Realism]] and [[Left realism|Left Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Walklate (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims, and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society.&lt;ref&gt;Elias (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Islamic]] [[feminism|feminist]] might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and, therefore, demand the decriminalization of abortion, adultery, and seduction ([[Zina]] is a [[Hudud]] offense in [[sharia|sharia law]]), and the criminalization of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual harassment]].

In formal academically published theory, the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal. Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific, medical evidence, by political change, and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes.

Conversely, when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime, they may be decriminalized. For example, Recommendation No. R (95) 12 adopted by the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]] of the Council of Europe on the management of criminal justice, advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization, depenalisation or diversion, and mediation should be adopted wherever possible. But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific, formulating policies based on their appeal to an uniformed electorate rather than properly conducted research.&lt;ref&gt;Currie (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization. These include the ''[[de minimis]]'' principle, that of the minimum criminalization.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of [[tort]] and [[regulation]]. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a "last resort" since such actions often infringe personal liberties &amp;ndash; [[incarceration]], for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions ([[murder]], [[rape]], [[assault]], for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt;

The policy of "social defense" can be seen as an opposing view. It argues that criminalization is used against "any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible". The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt; In general, worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences, in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the [[social defence]].&lt;ref name="ashworth68"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm===
{{see also|Victimless crimes}}
Leading criminal law philosophers, such as Dennis Baker and Joel Feinberg have argued that conduct should only be criminalized when it is fair to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate 2011) at chapter 3; Dennis J. Baker Dennis, "The Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote Harms", (2007) 11(3) New Criminal Law Review 371, Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, OUP, 1984: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such theorists assert that objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case. The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harm to others, but it cannot deal with all situations. For example, people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity. Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law, but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality. Prostitution is another grey area, as some countries allow it in different forms, and it is hard to say whether or not it specifically harms the public in general.  One argument may be that prostitution perpetuates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and therefore harms the public which partakes in the act of prostitution.  However, the legalization of prostitution would change the way it is regulated, and law enforcement could find a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease, thus eliminating the health issue and the question of the morality of the profession would be weakened.

People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country. Some will be injured out of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]], others by [[violence]] which might stem from a major conflict such as [[war]] or from the personal violence in a [[robbery]]. The [[natural environment|environment]] may be damaged by [[pollution]], there may be hazards at work. Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where [[supranationalism|supranational]] agencies and [[human rights]] organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries.

===Moral approaches and autonomy===
The extent to which behaviours considered [[morally wrong]] in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised, for example. [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state, and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone. Devlin's argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality; however, issues involving [[prejudice]] have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour. As well as prejudice, views were likely to vary widely on issues such as [[homosexuality]], [[contraception]] and other matters, particularly those influenced by religion. Agreement would be hard to find.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Other opposition has been from liberal groups which favour approaches which maximise individual rights.&lt;ref name="ashworth44"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A moral basis for criminalization would be [[paternalistic]], thereby contrasting with personal autonomy. The [[European Convention of Human Rights]], in the most part supporting individual rights from government interferences, still includes a provision for interference "for the protection of health and morals"&lt;ref name="ashworth44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm |title=Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Measures |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |year=2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as legally requiring [[seat belt]]s to be worn (in some jurisdictions) are hard to justify if an individualistic approach is taken, since, if public health provision is ignored, little harm is caused to others.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Raz]] argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality; rather, any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm. Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy. If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else's autonomy, then that can be legislated against.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some groups for whom the principle of autonomy is weakened: those under an [[age of majority]] and those people who are impaired by, for example, a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt; In general, these people are protected from activities with significant consequences, if they are not in a position to make reasoned decisions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 45&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the criminalization of [[under-age drinking]], [[smoking]], [[gambling]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Such criminalization is rarely challenged.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt;

In [[British law]], a distinction between public and private acts was made in the [[Wolfenden report]], which examined sexual activities (particularly homosexuality and [[prostitution]]). Some acts would effectively become legal within private settings, but illegal in public settings.&lt;ref name="ashworth46"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public. Such a line was favoured by [[Joel Feinberg]], who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented "serious offence" to persons other than the [[actor (law)|actor]].&lt;ref name="ashworth46"/&gt; Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable (that acts themselves not causing harm, for example), for example [[nudity]]. Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock, then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion, which varies from place to place and from time to time. The concept of "insult" rather than "offensive" may be more specific.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omission===
{{main|Omission (criminal law)}}
[[Common law]] does not often find an actor liable for omission &amp;ndash; failing to do something required by the law. Where this has applied it has typically been in industrial [[regulation]], in matters of [[social security]] or some personal regulated activity such as driving (for example, in the case of a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 47&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt; These form conditions placed upon operating in a particular manner and are thus understood in that context. There are few general duties in common law jurisdictions, although these do include the responsibility of a parent to safeguard their children, to a landowner to prevent offences being carried out there, and to someone creating a dangerous situation to attempt to limit that danger.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of limited liability for omissions suggest that the wording for such a law would be vague, possibly involving "reasonable" care or action, and so would be hard to enforce. This would give prosecutors wide discretion, which may be opposed to justice.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"/&gt; Morally, omission is viewed by many as a far lesser problem than act; compared to murder, allowing someone to die is seen as much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement to spend one's time and energy helping others would seem to contradict the autonomy many other laws aim to provide the individual with.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents point out these arguments fail to consider the harm that such omissions may cause, in contradiction to the harm principle many legal systems start out with. Life and physical integrity are often the highest priorities of a legal system.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Difficulties in definition are in common with many other areas, theorists such as Feinburg point out. A non-burdensome rescue is likely to be less valuable than freedom of action.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Limited liability is considered as article 223 of the [[French Penal Code]], which criminalises: "(1) a person who voluntarily neglects to prevent a serious crime of offense against that person, if that crime could be prevented without personal risk or risk to others; and (2) a person who voluntarily neglects to give, to a person in peril,  assistance which could be rendered without personal risk or risk to others."&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is common with several other European jurisdictions. Whilst open to the criticisms of vagueness and prosecutor discretion, it has not been seen as overly oppressive.&lt;ref name="ashworth50"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
When a state debates whether to respond to a source of injury by criminalising the behaviour that produces it, there are no pre-set criteria to apply in formulating social policy. There is no ontological reality to crime. The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens. Moreover, events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes, e.g. situations of [[corporate manslaughter]], are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters.

The criminalization process defines and classifies behaviour. It broadcasts the laws so that no-one may have the [[excuse]] of [[ignorantia juris non excusat|ignorance]], and disposes of those who will not obey. There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies. Crime control has become an industry, yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm. Such as it is, the process is made up of three components:
#Creation of a social order. This is both a socio-economic process, a "...fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion" and an ideological process so that there can be a "...development of values, beliefs, and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution."(p.&amp;nbsp;6). Thus, society must develop the apparatus of law creation, law enforcement and [[punishment]] and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community. If the laws do not match the general [[mores]], their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony. Conformity to the social order must, for the most part, be self-enforced.
#For the times when self-enforcement fails, society must create a legal order. This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state.  Some states justified the criminalization process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security, the policy of control, policing, criminal justice, and penal practice. The modern state is [[decentralisation|decentralising]] and [[privatisation|privatising]] its functions. This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co-operatively with other for-profit agencies.
#The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as [[legislature]]s and [[judge]]s set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order, i.e. of people defined as criminal and processed through that system.

==Ontological basis of crime==

Put in the most simple terms, ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being. (Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time, introduction, referencing Plato's Parmenides.) In some of the traditional schools, such as those of the post-1688 English or Americans (many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers, but especially The Federalist) and their Dutch predecessors (see Kossmann, E. H. Political Thought in the Dutch Republic, 2004) ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought, in accord with the modern distinction between society and state (which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies, the socii, but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. See [[State (polity)|state]].) However, some classical theorists, such as Aristotle, in his Politics and Metaphysics, and to a lesser degree in his Topics,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} suggest that the distinction is at least problematic. One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so.

As a political animal, man has come to see himself as possessed of rights,&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/&lt;/ref&gt; whether these are the [[Rights of Englishmen]] of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in [[Castle Rock v. Gonzales]]), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of civil redress. Thus, again in simple terms, and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis. (For one approach to the question of criminal ontology, see "Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies: Looking Back and Moving Forward" by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross, ed. Cutting the Edge: Current Perspectives in Radical/Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998.) This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided. This need not, however, force the question of meta-political crimes. Our purposes here, in this article, are limited to the political. For the question in general see [[Ontology]].

Baker  argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences (or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses) are prima facie criminalizable. By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law,  but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms.

Inclusions are stored nutrients, secretory products, and pigment granules. Examples of inclusions are [[glycogen]] granules in the liver and muscle cells, [[lipid]] droplets in fat cells, [[pigment]] granules in certain cells of skin and hair, water-containing [[vacuoles]], and crystals of various types.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Leslie P. Gartner and James L. Hiatt ; Text book of Histology; 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

These structures were first observed by [[O. F. Müller]] in 1786.&lt;ref name=Shively/&gt;

==Examples==
'''[[Glycogen]]''': Glycogen is the most common form of [[glucose]] in animals and is especially abundant in cells of muscles, and liver. It appears in electron micrograph as clusters, or a rosette of beta particles that resemble [[ribosomes]], located near the [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Glycogen is an important energy source of the cell; therefore, it will be available on demand.  The enzymes responsible for glycogenolysis degrade glycogen into individual molecules of glucose and can be utilized by multiple organs of the body.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Fawcett; The cell, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amenta1997"/&gt;

'''[[Lipid]]s''': Lipids are [[triglycerides]] in storage form is the common form of inclusions, not only are stored in specialized cells ([[adipocytes]]) but also are located as individuals droplets in various cell type especially [[hepatocytes]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; These are fluid at body temperature and appear in living cells as [[refractile]] spherical droplets. Lipid yields more than twice as many calories per gram as does carbohydrate. On demand, they serve as a local store of energy and a potential source of short carbon chains that are used by the cell in its synthesis of membranes and other lipid containing structural components or secretory products.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''[[Crystal]]s''': Crystalline inclusions have long been recognized as normal constituents of certain cell types such as [[Sertoli cells]] and [[Leydig cells]] of the human testis, and occasionally in [[macrophages]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; It is believed that these structures are crystalline forms of certain proteins which is located everywhere in the cell such as in [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondria]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi body]], and free in cytoplasmic matrix.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''[[Pigment]]s''':  The most common pigment in the body, besides [[hemoglobin]] of red blood cells is [[melanin]], manufactured by [[melanocytes]] of the skin and hair, pigments cells of the retina and specialized nerve cells in the [[substantia nigra]] of the brain.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; These pigments have protective functions in skin and aid in the sense of sight in the retina but their functions in neurons is not understood completely. Furthermore, cardiac tissue and central nervous system neurons shows yellow to brown pigment called [[lipofuscin]], some believed that they have lysosomal activity.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''Secretory products:''' [[Hormone]]s, [[mucus]], [[Digestive enzyme|digestives enzymes]], [[neurotransmitters]], fibrous proteins, and hydrochloric acid are all different types of secretory products found in cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasmic inclusions bound for secretion in some secretory cells are sometimes not visible by microscopy; some glands secrete products that are only released when needed by the body. An example of such glands is steroid-secreting endocrine gland.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;

== Discussion ==

Since its introduction in the late 1990s, peer-reviewed papers on the database have received thousands of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mark Gerstein - Google Scholar Citations|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YvjuUugAAAAJ|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Werner G. Krebs - Google Scholar Citations|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zVjmhJ8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database has been mentioned in news articles in major scientific journals,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bourne" /&gt; book chapters,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Users can search the database for a particular motion by either [[protein]] name or [[Protein Data Bank]] ID number.&lt;ref name=:1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstein M, Krebs W |title=A database of macromolecular motions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=26 |issue=18 |pages=4280–90 |date=September 1998 |pmid= 9722650|pmc=147832 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9722650 |doi=10.1093/nar/26.18.4280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, however, users will enter the database via the [[Protein Data Bank]], which often provides a hyperlink to the molmovdb entry for proteins found in both databases.

The database includes a web-based tool (the Morph server) which allows non-experts to animate and visualize certain types of protein [[conformational change]] through the generation of short movies. This system uses [[molecular modelling]] techniques to [[interpolate]] the structural changes between two different protein conformers and to generate a set of intermediate structures.

'''Deaccessioning''' is defined as the process by which a work of art or other object is permanently removed from a [[Collection (artwork)|museum’s collection]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Report from the AAMD Task Force on Deaccessioning. 2010. ''AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning''. The Association of American Museum Directors, June 9, 2010. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }} Accessed November 14th 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; Deaccessioning is a practical and constructive tool of collections care that, if practiced thoughtfully supports the long-term preservation of a collection and can help a [[museum]] refine the scope of its collection in order to better serve its mission and community.

==Deaccession policy==
The process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum`s [[Collections policy|Collection Management Policy]]. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the "Deaccession" section of this document.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethic considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.

==Decision process==
Each museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last = Buck|first = Rebecca A.|last2 = Gilmore|first2 = Jean Allman|title = Museum Registration Methods|place = Washington, D.C.|publisher = The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year = 2010|edition = 5|chapter = 3I: Deaccessioning|pages = 100–107|isbn = 978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Park Service - Museum Management Program|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/handbook.html|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process begins with the [[curator]] creating a document called a "Statement of Justification," which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum`s collection, a [[curator]] or [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]] completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Deaccession criteria===
There are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The work is no longer consistent with the mission or collecting goals of the museum. 
* The work is of poor quality and lacks value for exhibition or study purposes. 
* The physical condition of the work is so poor that restoration is not practicable or would compromise the work’s integrity or the artist’s intent. Works damaged beyond reasonable repair that are not of use for study or teaching purposes may be destroyed.  
* The museum is unable to care adequately for the work because of the work’s particular requirements for storage or display or its continuing need for special treatment for proper and long term conservation.  
* The work is being sold as part of the museum’s effort to refine and improve its collections, in keeping with the collecting goals reviewed and approved by the museum’s Board of Trustees or governing body.  
* The authenticity or attribution of the work is determined to be false or fraudulent and the object lacks sufficient aesthetic merit or art historical importance to warrant retention.  
* The work is a duplicate that has no value as part of a series.  
* The work may have been stolen or illegally imported in violation of applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the museum is located or the work may be subject to other legal claims, including but not limited to repatriation under [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA (]]The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and art found to have been plundered during WWII by the [[Nazi plunder|Nazis]].

===Deaccession justification steps===
The typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* Verification of Legal Status: Staff verifies that the museum possesses official legal title of the work and check their records in order to ascertain if there are any restrictions that exist in the original gift, bequest, or purchase which may hinder or limit disposal options, including transfer of copyright or trademark.
** The need to establish clear and unrestricted title is important because it ensures the museum can dispose of the work the via legal sale without risk of improper title transfer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Malaro, M. and I.P. DeAngelis (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections. Chp. 5: The Disposal of Objects. pp.248-272.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See:[[Tangible personal property]]
** Donor restrictions are also uncovered at this stage of the process. Some donor restrictions determined at the gifting or bequest of the work or works may hinder the deaccession and/or the disposal process. 
*** For example, the museum is looking to deaccession one piece of a set that was gifted and the donor`s "Deed of Gift or Bequest" included a request that the set remain together. In this case, the museum might need to seek legal counsel and take the documents to a judge to gain release from the Deed of Gift or Bequest restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
** In the process of determining clear title, [[provenance]] research should ideally be conducted, especially if the deaccession process was instigated by a claim of illicit title, such as in the case of a Nazi Looted work or stolen work of antiquity. 
*** See [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO]] Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and AAM Statement on the "Standards Regarding the Unlawful Appropriation of Objects During the Nazi Era"[http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship/objects-during-the-nazi-era]
*Physical Examination: A conservator conducts an assessment of the work to determine its current  condition, future maintenance needs, and viable disposal options, such as possible sale or destruction. 
*Object Evaluation: Acquiring through one or more appraisers reasonable evaluations of the work would be helpful especially if the work is to be disposed of via sale, auction, transfer or exchange for value in kind with another institution.
*Director and/ or Governing Board approval: Following an internal review by all relevant staff, all documentation is presented to the Governing Board and/or the CEO/ Museum Director for final approval. The workflow and final decision on deaccession is subject to the collection policies workflow and charters for each museum.   
*Notification of Donor and/or External Stakeholders: Once the Governing Board and/ or the CEO/ Museum Director approves the deaccession the last step before beginning disposal is the notification of donor and external stakeholders of the deaccession. Although the museum holds clear title of the work and is not obliged by law to contact the donor of intent to deaccession, many museums contact donors or relatives out of courtesy. Museums may also confer with local community advisory groups, such as museum members, local collectors, other local museums, and volunteers about the deaccession to inform and gain community perspective on the work and its value to the collection.

===Disposal===
Disposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the Governing Board and/or the CEO/Museum Director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal.

The process of disposal is completed through the following methods:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

*Donation of the object to another museum, library, or archive for educational purposes 
**This is the ideal disposal choice for museums as it assures that the object will remain accessible to the public. Museums seek out possible institutions where the object might a useful addition to the collection or is better equipped to maintain the object.[[File:Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva.jpg|thumb|Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva, An example of a Deaccessioned work: Deaccessioned in 1988 from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Purchased by Ball State University Museum of Art, Muncie, Indiana from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1989.]]
*Exchange of the object for another object with another museum or non-profit institution
**This is another viable method for assuring that the object remains accessible to the public in some way.  Exchanges are made in such a way that there is relatively equal value of the items involved, not just monetarily but historically.
***Museum should be able to justify the trade, including any exceptional circumstances that would favor one party over another. This is why obtaining an appraisal of the object from more than one appraiser is a mandatory step in the deaccession process. See &lt;u&gt;Object Evaluation&lt;/u&gt; above.   
*Educational and Research programs 
**Often works deaccession from the collection can be reallocated into educational programs, to be used for hands-on demonstrations, school outreach programs, or testing for conservation research. In this case it is understood that the work will be subject to physical destruction over time.  In this case, the work would be re-accessioned into a study or educational collection that is not as closely monitored as that of the main collection. See link for one example of an outreach school program that utilizes deaccessioned works [http://www.historyisfun.org/learn/virginia-outreach/].   
*Physical Destruction 
**Objects that may have deteriorated due to an [[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|inherent vice]], natural disaster, vandalism, accident, or other causes as well as works that made be considered hazardous, such as those containing drugs, chemicals, explosives, or asbestos should be disposed of via physical destruction. If dealing with hazardous materials, the proper authorities should be consulted in order to determine the best method of destruction.  The method of destruction will depend on the type of material and completed in such a ways as to be irreversible. This is also the best method for works that are found to be fakes or [[Forgery|forgeries]]. See &lt;u&gt;Physical Examination&lt;/u&gt; above.   
**Human remains or certain items of religious or cultural sensitivity might need to be handled in a prescribed way in order to meet legal requirements or cultural standards. See [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]] from more information.    
*Repatriation. 
**Repatriation is the process of returning an object to their place of origin or proper owner.  This is method of disposal is used for objects found to be illicitly held by the museum, such as [[Nazi plunder|Nazi Looted Art]] and objects requested for return according to [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]]. The illicit status of an object would be determined upon claim of repatriation via NAGPRA or claim by proper owner, in the case of Nazi Looted or other stolen works. In either case, clear title and provenance would be determined during the Verification of Legal Status step of deaccession. See &lt;u&gt;Verification of Legal Status&lt;/u&gt; above.    
*Return to Donor.
**Similar to the process of repatriation, if the work was donated to the museum and the donor or legal heir can be located at time of deaccession processing, the museum may elect to return the object to the donor. This is not the best option for museums for a few reasons. First, it removes the work from public accessibility and second, it can cause tax complications, as a deduction can be given for a portion of the work`s value upon donation and the return of the work to the donor may result in an audit or at least IRS claim on the deduction value previously received.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|thumb|An auction at [[Christie's]].]]
*Private Sale and Public Auction.
**Another method of disposal that is not the best option for museums. Museums hold collections in the public trust for public access. Though the best manner in which to generate funds from disposal for future accessions and care of current collection, disposal of works via sale or auction takes the work away from public access and places it into the hands of private citizens.

==Deaccession and museum ethics==
Several professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession.nTwo majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Stephen E. ''A Deaccession Reader.'' Washington, DC: American Association of Museums, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls.

According to the [https://www.aamd.org/ AAMD] (The Association of Art Museum Directors): "Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum’s policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [http://www.aam-us.org/home AAM] (the American Association of Museums): "Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum`s discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections."&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Ethics for Museums'', AAM. Washington DC. 1994, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Association for State and Local History|AASLH]] (the American Association for State and Local History): "Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections."&lt;ref&gt;A Statement of Professional Ethics, American Association for State and Local History, Nashville, Tennessee, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [http://icom.museum/ ICOM] (the International Council of Museums): Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/ICOM_News/2003-1/ENG/p3_2003-1.pdf|title = Deaccessioning and ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums|date = Jan 2003|accessdate = |website = ICOM News|publisher = ICOM News|last = Lewis|first = Geoffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today`s public but the future public. See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/public_trust_doctrine Public trust doctrine]

==Views on deaccessioning==
Deaccessioning is a controversial topic and activity, with diverging opinions from artists, arts professionals and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Museums Draw Scrutiny When They Sell Artworks|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-01-26|access-date = 2015-12-12|issn = 0362-4331|first = Robin|last = Pogrebin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as Donn Zaretsky of The Art Law Blog critique the notion of "the public trust" and argue that deaccessioning rules should probably be thrown out altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AAMD Rules Need to be Deaccessioned - News - Art in America|url = http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/aamd-rules-need-to-be-deaccessioned/|website = www.artinamericamagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Susan Taylor, director of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the AAMD's current president, believes that proceeds from the sale or funds from the deaccession can only be used to buy other works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = As Museums Try To Make Ends Meet, 'Deaccession' Is The Art World's Dirty Word|url = https://www.npr.org/2014/08/11/339532879/as-museums-try-to-make-ends-meet-deaccession-is-the-art-worlds-dirty-word|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

'''Decentralized wastewater systems''' (also referred to as '''decentralized wastewater treatment systems''') convey, treat and dispose or reuse [[wastewater]] from small communities, buildings and dwellings in remote areas, individual public or private properties. [[Wastewater]] flow is generated when appropriate water supply is available within the buildings or close to them.

Decentralized wastewater systems treat, reuse or dispose the effluent in relatively close vicinity to its source of generation. They have the purpose to protect [[public health]] and the [[natural environment]] by reducing substantially health and environmental hazards.

They are also referred as "decentralized wastewater treatment systems" because the main technical challenge is the adequate choice of a treatment and/or disposal facility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wastewatereducation.org/watertowaste/epa_septic_program_strategy.pdf|title=Decentralized wastewater systems: a program strategy, EPA, Washington DC, USA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borda-sea.org/basic-needs-services/dewats-decentralized-wastewater-treatment.html|title=DEWATS/Decentralized wastewater treatment, BORDA, South-east Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly used acronym for decentralized wastewater treatment system, is DEWATS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Comparison to centralized systems ===
Centralized wastewater systems are the most widely applied in well-developed urban environments and the oldest approach to the solution of the problems associated with wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Karman D. (2007) [http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/waters/article.html The 'Cloaka Maxima' and the monumental manipulation of water in archaic Rome], On-line journal ''&amp;nbsp;The Water of Rome,'' retrieved on the 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;They collect wastewater in large and bulk pipeline networks, also referred as [[sewerage]], which transport it at long distances to one or several treatment plants.  [[Stormwater|Storm water]] can be collected in either [[combined sewer]]s or in a separate storm water drains.  The latter consists of two separate pipeline systems, one for the wastewater and one for the storm water. The treated effluent is disposed in different ways, most often discharged into natural water bodies. The treated effluent may also be used for beneficial purposes and in this case it is referred as [[reclaimed water]].

The main difference between decentralized and centralized systems is in the conveyance structure. In decentralized systems the treatment and disposal or reuse of the effluent is close to the source of generation. This results in a small conveyance network, in some cases limited only to one pipeline. The size of the network allows for applications of different conveyance methods, in addition to the well-known gravity sewers, such as pressurized sewers and [[vacuum sewer]]s. The quantity of the effluent is low and is characterized by significant fluctuations.

=== Applications ===
In locations with developed infrastructure, decentralized wastewater systems could be a viable alternative of the conventional centralized system, especially in cases of upgrading or retrofitting existing systems.&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt; Many different combinations and variations of ''hybrid'' systems are possible. The development of new treatment technologies allows for decentralized solutions, which are technically and aesthetically sound and acceptable.

Decentralized applications are a necessity in cases of new urban developments, where the construction of the infrastructure is not ready or will be executed in future. In many countries and locations, the infrastructure development (roads, water supply and especially wastewater/drainage systems) is executed years after the housing development. In such cases decentralized wastewater facilities are considered as a temporary solution, but they are mandatory, in order to prevent public health and ecological problems.

Decentralized systems allow for flow separation or source separation, which segregates different types of wastewater, based on their origin, such as: [[Blackwater (waste)|black water]], [[greywater]] and [[urine]].&lt;ref name="Leverenz"&gt;Tchobanoglous G., Leverenz H. (2013) The rationale for decentralization of wastewater infrastructure, in: [https://books.google.bg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=decentralized+wastewater+systems&amp;ots=CHVe6w98Wu&amp;sig=VvTMLtDYXrW60pGHm0xKI_HTpPs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=decentralized%20wastewater%20systems&amp;f=false Source separation and decentralization for wastewater management], ed: Larsen T.A., Udert K.M., Lienert J., ''IWA publishing'', London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires separate parallel pipeline/plumbing systems to convey the segregated flows and the purpose is to apply different level of treatment and handling of each flow and to enhance the safe reuse and disposal of the end products.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Grey water] . World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[Developing country|developing countries]], where localities with poor infrastructure are common, decentralized wastewater treatment has been promoted extensively because of the possibility to apply technologies with low operation and maintenance requirements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sasse, L. (1998). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1933 DEWATS Decentralised Wastewater Treatment in Developing Countries]. Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (BORDA), Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, decentralized approaches require smaller scale investments, compared to centralized solutions.

Based on the size of the served area, different scales of decentralization could be found:
* Decentralization at the level of a suburb or satellite township in an urban area – these systems could be defined as small centralized systems when applied to small towns or rural communities. But if they are applied only to selected suburbs or districts in medium or large population centres, with existing centralized system,&amp;nbsp;the whole system could be defined as a ''hybrid'' system, where decentralization is applied to parts of the whole drained area.&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt;
* Decentralization at the level of a neighbourhood – this category includes clusters of homes, gated communities, small districts and areas, which are served by vacuum sewers.  
* Decentralization at “on-site” level ([[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sanitation]]) – in these cases the whole system lays within one property and serves one or several buildings.

== Wastewater treatment options ==
[[File:Biogas digester at Meru prison (3504698658).jpg|thumb|Biogas digester for decentralized wastewater treatment at Meru Prison, Kenya]]
Treatment/disposal facilities requiring effluent infiltration: usually they are applied at on-site level and are adequate because of the very low wastewater quantity generated. However, they require suitable soil conditions, permitting [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of the excess water, and low [[Water table|ground water table]]. If not applied properly, they may be a serious source of ground water pollution.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;''[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/2004_07_07_septics_septic_2002_osdm_all.pdf Onsite wastewater treatment systems manual]'' (2002), EPA 625/R-00/008, Washington DC, USA&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pit latrine]]s are applied when the water supply is very scarce and wastewater flow can hardly be generated. They are the most common sanitation technique in under-developed areas.
* [[Septic tank]]s are the most common on-site treatment technology used, which can be applied successfully where an adequate water supply is available and the soil/groundwater conditions are acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt;
Treatment facilities resembling natural purification processes: their application requires significant surface area, because of the slow pace of the biological processes applied. For the same reason they are more suitable for warmer climates, because the rate of the purification process is temperature dependent. These technologies are more resilient to fluctuating loads and do not require complex maintenance and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Scholzel &amp; Bowel (1999) [http://www.pacificwater.org/userfiles/file/TR0288.pdf Small scale treatment plant project – report on project criteria, guidelines and technologies], SOPAC TR288, retrieved on the 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constructed wetland]]s are more suitable for applications at on-site or at neighbourhood level, while [[stabilization pond]]s could be a viable alternative for decentralized systems at the level of small towns or rural communities.

Engineered wastewater treatment technologies: there is a large variety of [[wastewater treatment plants]] where different treatment processes and technologies are applied.&lt;ref&gt;''Wastewater engineering&amp;nbsp;: treatment and reuse (4th ed.). Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA. 2003. &amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-07-112250-8}}.''&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale treatment facilities in decentralized systems, apply similar technologies as medium or large plants.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Crites R., Tchobanoglous G. (1998) Small and decentralized &amp;nbsp;wastewater management, ''WCB/McGraw-Hill'', {{ISBN|0-07-289087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For on-site applications package plants are developed, which are compact and have different compartments for the different processes. However, the design and operation of small treatment plants, especially at neighbourhood or on-site level,  present significant challenges to wastewater engineers, related to flow fluctuations, necessity of competent and specialized operation and maintenance, required to deal with a large number of small plants, and relatively high per capita cost.&lt;ref&gt;Boller. M. (1997) Small wastewater plants- a challenge to wastewater engineers, ''Water Science and Technology,'' Vol 35, issue 6, p.1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations and management ==
[[Regulation and monitoring of pollution#Water pollution|Water pollution regulations]] in the form of [[legislation]] documents, [[guideline]]s or [[Local ordinance|ordinance]]s prescribe the necessary level of treatment, so that the treated effluent meets the requirements for safe disposal or reuse. Effluent may be disposed by discharging into a natural water body or infiltrated in the ground. In addition, regulations  mention requirements regarding the design and operation of wastewater systems, as well as the penalties and other measures for their enforcement. Centralized systems are designed, built and operated in order to fulfil the existing regulations. Their management usually is executed by [[Local Authorities|local authorities]]. In hybrid systems and small centralized systems in towns or rural communities management can be executed in the same way.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the case of decentralization at on-site level and clusters of buildings, the whole wastewater system is located within private premises. The costs and responsibility for the design, construction, operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the owner. In many cases specialized companies might execute the operation and maintenance procedures. The local authorities issue permits and may provide support for the operation and management in the form of collecting wastes, issuing certificates/licenses for standardized treatment equipment, or for selected qualified private companies. From regulatory point of view, the control of the quality of treated effluent for reuse, discharge or disposal is entirely the responsibility of local or national government authorities. This might be a challenge if a large number of systems must be controlled and inspected. It is in the owner's interest to operate and maintain the system properly, especially in the case of reuse of the treated effluent. Most often the operational problems are associated with clogging of the treatment facilities as result of irregular removal of the sludge or hydraulic overloading due to increased number of population served or increased water consumption.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Urban planning and infrastructure issues ==
Wastewater systems are part of the [[infrastructure]] of urban or rural communities and the [[urban planning]] process. Urban planning data and information, such as plots of individual dwellings, roads/streets, storm water drainage, water supply, and electricity systems are essential for the design and implementation of a sustainable wastewater system. In decentralized wastewater systems, which collect and treat wastewater only, storm water might be overlooked and cause flooding problems. If planned decentralized solutions are applied, storm water drainage should be executed together with the roads system.

In under-developed population centres where no infrastructure is available, is difficult to provide sustainable sanitation measures; e.g. pit latrines/septic tanks need periodic cleansing, usually executed by [[Vacuum Tracks|vacuum tracks]], which have to access the latrine and need a basic road for this purpose. [[Fecal sludge management]] deals with the organization and implementation of this practice in a sustainable way, including collection, transport, treatment and disposal/reuse of faecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;WSTF (2015). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2448 Design and Technologies of Decentralised Treatment Facilities] - Manuals and further documents developed in the context of GIZ’s Water Sector Reform Programme. Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF), Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cases of new urban/rural developments, or the retrofitting of  existing ones, it is advisable  to consider different alternatives regarding the design of the wastewater system, including decentralized solutions. A sustainable approach would require optimal technical solutions in terms of reliability and cost effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; From this perspective, centralized solutions might be more appropriate in many cases, depending on existing sizes of plots, [[topography]], [[geology]], ground water tables  and climatic conditions. But when applied adequately, decentralized systems allow for the application of more environmentally friendly solutions and reuse of the treated effluent, including recovery and reuse of specific elements. In this way alternative water resources are provided and the environment is protected. In addition [[Public awareness of science|public awareness]], perceptions and support are an important  part of the urban planning process in general, and the choice of adequate wastewater system in specific.,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Anderson K., Dickin S., Rosemarin A. (2017) [http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289/htm Towards "sustainable" sanitation: challenges and opportunities in urban areas",] ''Sustainability,'' 8, doi: 10-3390/su8121289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2757 Wastewater - the untapped resource], The UN world water development report 2017, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
One example of decentralized treatment is the "DEWATS technology" which has been promoted under this name by the German NGO [[Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association|BORDA]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been applied in many countries in South East Asia and in South Africa.&lt;ref name="ESCAP"&gt;ESCAP, UN-Habitat, AIT (2015).

This technology was researched and tested in South Africa where it was shown that the treatment efficiency was lower than expected.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Reynaud, N. (2015).

A case study of a decentralized wastewater system at on-site level with treated effluent reuse was performed at the Botswana Technology Centre in Gaborone, Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;Hranova R (2005) The Wastewater Reuse Practice in Botswana – a Challenge for the Development of the Water Sector, ''Proceedings of the BIE annual conference – 19–21 October 2005, Gaborone, Botswana.'' (Proceedings in CD format)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of a decentralized wastewater system, which serves one institutional building, located in an area served by municipal sewerage. Wastewater from the building is treated in a plant consisting of: septic tank, followed by planted rock filter, [[Biofilter|bio-filter]] and a surface flow wetland. The treated effluent is reused for irrigation of the surrounding green areas, but the study registered outflow from the wetland only during periods of heavy rains. This example shows the need for careful estimation of the expected quantity, quality and fluctuations of the generated wastewater when designing decentralized wastewater systems.

{{short description| A pattern of daily vertical movement characteristic of many aquatic species }}

'''Diel vertical migration (DVM)''', also known as '''diurnal vertical migration''', is a pattern of movement used by some organisms, such as [[copepod]]s, living in the [[ocean]] and in [[lake]]s. The [[Animal migration|migration]] occurs when organisms move up to the [[epipelagic]] zone at night and return to the [[mesopelagic]] zone of the oceans or to the [[hypolimnion]] zone of lakes during the day. The word ''diel'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''dies'' [[day]], and means a 24-hour period. In terms of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], it is the greatest migration in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diel Vertical Migration (DVM)|url=http://funwithkrill.blogspot.com/2011/08/diel-vertical-migration-dvm.html|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from [[crustacean]]s ([[copepod]]s),&lt;ref name="P.B.

==Discovery==
During [[World War II]] the [[U.S. Navy]] was taking [[sonar]] readings of the ocean when they discovered the [[deep scattering layer]] (DSL). While performing sound propagation experiments the University of California's Division of War Research (UCDWR), consistently had results of the [[Echo sounding|echo-sounder]] that showed a distinct reverberation that they attributed to mid-water layer scattering agents, there was speculation these readings may be attributed to enemy submarines. By collaborating with biologists from Scripps Institution and the UCDWR, they were able to confirm that the observed reverberations from the echo-sounder were in fact related to the diel vertical migration of marine animals. The DSL was caused by large, dense groupings of organisms, like zooplankton,&amp;nbsp;that scattered the sonar to create a false or second bottom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physical Oceanography|last=Hill|first=M.N.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once scientists started to do more research on what was causing the DSL, it was discovered that a large range of organisms were vertically migrating. Most types of [[plankton]] and some types of [[nekton]] have exhibited some type of vertical migration, although it is not always diel. These migrations may have substantial effects on [[mesopredator]]s and [[apex predators]] by modulating the concentration and accessibility of their prey (e.g., impacts on the foraging behavior of [[pinnipeds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Horning, M. |author2=Trillmich, F. |title=Lunar cycles in diel prey migrations exert a stronger effect on the diving of juveniles than adult Galapagos fur seals|year=1999|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|volume=266|issue=1424 |pages=1127–1132|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0753 |pmid=10406130 |pmc=1689955}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Types of vertical migration==
;Diel:This is the most common form of vertical migration. Organisms migrate on a daily basis through different depths in the water column. Migration usually occurs between shallow surface waters of the epipelegic zone and deeper mesopelagic zone of the ocean or hypolimnion zone of lakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: Furthermore, there are three recognized types of diel vertical migration. This includes nocturnal vertical migration, the most common form, where organisms ascend to the surface around dusk, remaining at the surface for the night, then migrating to depth again around dawn. The second form is reverse migration, which occurs with organisms ascending to the surface at sunrise and remaining high in the water column throughout the day until descending with the setting sun. The third form is twilight diel vertical migration, involving two separate migrations in a single 24-hour period, with the first ascent at dusk followed by a descent at midnight, often known as the "midnight sink".

In addition, there is a trend seen in other copepods, like ''Acartia spp''. That have an increasing amplitude of their DVM seen with their progressive life stages. This is possibly due to increasing body size of the copepods and associated risk of visual predators, like fish, as being larger makes them more noticeable.&lt;ref name="P.B. Holliland, I. Ahlbeck, E. Westlund, S. Hansson 298–307"/&gt;

==Vertical migration stimuli==
There are two different factors that are known to play a role in vertical migration, [[endogenous]] and [[exogenous]]. Endogenous factors originate from the organism itself; sex, age, [[biological rhythms]], etc. Exogenous factors are environmental factors acting on the organism such as light, gravity, oxygen, temperature, predator-prey interactions, etc.

=== Endogenous factors ===
'''Endogenous rhythm'''

Biological clocks are an ancient and adaptive sense of time innate to an organism that allows them to anticipate environmental changes and cycles so they are able to physiologically and behaviorally respond to the expected change. Evidence of circadian rhythms controlling DVM, metabolism, and even gene expression have been found in copepod species, ''Calanus finmarchicus''. These copepods were shown to continue to exhibit these daily rhythms of vertical migration in the laboratory setting even in constant darkness, after being captured from an actively migrating wild population.&lt;ref name="N.S. Hafker, B. Meyer, K.S. Last, D.W. Pond, L. Huppe, M. Taschke 2194–2201"/&gt; An experiment was done at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] which kept organisms in column tanks with light/dark cycles. A few days later the light was changed to a constant low light and the organisms still displayed diel vertical migration. Thus suggestions that some type of internal response was causing the migration.&lt;ref name="Enright, J.T.."&gt;{{cite journal | last=Enright | first=J.T. |author2=W.M. Hammer |year=1967 | title=Vertical Diurnal Migration and Endogenous Rhythmicity | journal=Science | volume=157 | pages=937–941 | jstor= 1722121 | doi=10.1126/science.157.3791.937 | pmid=17792830 | issue=3791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clock gene expression'''

Many organisms including the copepod ''C. finmarchicus'', has genetic material devoted to maintaining its biological clock. The expression of these genes varies temporally with the expression significantly increasing following dawn and dusk at times of greatest vertical migration seen in this species. These finding may indicate they work as a molecular stimulus for vertical migration.&lt;ref name="N.S. Hafker, B. Meyer, K.S. Last, D.W. Pond, L. Huppe, M. Taschke 2194–2201"/&gt;

'''Body size'''

The relative body size of an organism has been found to effect DVM. Bull trout express daily and seasonal vertical migrations with smaller individuals always staying at a deeper layer than the larger individuals. This is most likely due to a predation risk but is dependent on the individuals own size such that smaller animals may be more inclined to remain at depth.&lt;ref name="L.F.G. Gutowsky, P.M. Harrison, E.G. Martins, A. Leake, D.A. Patterson, M. Power, S.J. Cooke 365–373"/&gt;

===Exogenous factors===
'''Light'''

Light is the most common and critical cue for vertical migration.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Organisms want to find an optimum light intensity ([[isolume]]). Whether it is no light or a large amount of light, an organism will travel to where it is most comfortable. Studies have shown that during a full moon organisms will not migrate up as far or during an eclipse they will start to migrate.&lt;ref name="Richards, Shane."&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richards | first=Shane |author2=Hugh Possingham |author3=John Noye  |year=1996 | title=Diel vertical migration: modeling light-mediated mechanisms | journal=Journal of Plankton Research| volume=18 | pages=2199–2222 | url= http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/12/2199.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1093/plankt/18.12.2199 | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temperature'''

Organisms will migrate to a water depth with suitable temperatures that best suit the organisms needs, for example some fish species migrate to warmer surface waters in order to aid digestion. Temperature changes can influence swimming behavior of some copepods. In the presence of a strong thermocline some zooplankton may be inclined to pass through it, and migrate to the surface waters, though this can be very variable even in a single species. The marine copepod, ''Calanus finmarchicus,'' will migrate through gradients with temperature differences of 6&amp;nbsp;°C over George's Ban''k;'' whereas, in the North Sea they are observed to remain below the gradient.&lt;ref name="Ringelberg 2010 122–127"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diel Vertical Migration of Zooplankton in Lakes and Oceans|last=Ringelberg|first=Joop|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-3092-4|location=London New York, USA|pages=122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salinity'''

Changes in salinity may promote organism to seek out more suitable waters if they happen to be [[stenohaline]] or unequipped to handle regulating their osmotic pressure. Areas that are impacted by tidal cycles accompanied by salinity changes, estuaries for example, may see vertical migration in some species of zooplankton.&lt;ref name="Barnes 1993 327–329"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oceanography and Marine Biology, An Annual Review|last=Barnes|first=Margaret|publisher=CRC Press|year=1993|isbn=|volume=31|location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA|pages=327–329}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas such as the Arctic, melting ice causes a layer of freshwater which organisms cannot cross.

'''Pressure'''

Pressure changes have been found to produce differential responses that result in vertical migration. many zooplankton will react to increased pressure with positive phototaxis, a negative geotaxis, and/or a kinetic response that results in ascending in the water column. Likewise, when there is a decrease in pressure, the zoo plankton respond by passively sinking or active downward swimming to descend in the water column.&lt;ref name="Barnes 1993 327–329"/&gt;

'''Predator kairomones'''

A predator might release a [[kairomone|chemical cue]] which could cause its prey to vertically migrate away.&lt;ref name="von Elert, Eric."&gt;{{cite journal | last=von Elert | first=Eric | author2=Georg Pohnert | year=2000 | title=Diel Predator specificity of kairomones in diel vertical migration of Daphnia: a chemical approach | journal=OIKOS | volume=88 | pages=119–128 | url=http://0-www.jstor.org.helin.uri.edu/sici?sici=0030-1299%282000%2988%3A1%3C119%3APSOKID%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X&amp;origin=serialsolutions | issn=0030-1299 | issue=1 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880114.x }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may stimulate the prey to vertically migrate to avoid said predator. The introduction of a potential predator species, like a fish, to the habitat of diel vertical migrating zooplankton has been shown to influence the distribution patterns seen in their migration. For example, a study used ''Daphnia'' and a fish that was too small to prey of them (''Lebistus reticulatus''), found that with the introduction of the fish to the system the ''Daphnia'' remained below the [[thermocline]], where the fish was not present. This demonstrates the effects of kairomones on ''Daphnia'' DVM''.&lt;ref name="Ringelberg 2010 122–127"/&gt;''

'''Tidal Patterns'''

Some organisms have been found to move with the tidal cycle. A study looked at the abundance of a species of small shrimp, ''Acetes sibogae,'' and found that they tended to move further higher in the water column and in higher numbers during flood tides than during ebb tides experiences at the mouth of an estuary. It is possible that varying factors with the tides may be the true trigger for the migration rather than the movement of the water itself, like the salinity or minute pressure changes.&lt;ref name="Barnes 1993 327–329"/&gt;

==Reasons for vertical migration==
There are many hypotheses as to why organisms would vertically migrate, and several may be valid at any given time.&lt;ref name="Kerfoot, WC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerfoot |first=WC |year=1985 |title=Adaptive value of vertical migration: Comments on the predation hypothesis and some alternatives |journal=Contributions in Marine Science |volume=27 |pages=91–113 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=1587950 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Predator avoidance: Light-dependent predation by fish is a common pressure that causes DVM behavior in zooplankton. A given body of water may be viewed as a risk gradient whereby the surface layers are riskier to reside in during the day than deep water, and as such promotes varied longevity among zooplankton that settle at different daytime depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Depth-selection behavior and longevity in Daphnia: an evolutionary test for the predation-avoidance hypothesis|journal = Hydrobiologia|date = 2012-11-23|issn = 0018-8158|pages = 87–91|volume = 715|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10750-012-1393-5|first = Piotr|last = Dawidowicz|first2 = Piotr|last2 = Prędki|first3 = Barbara|last3 = Pietrzak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in many instances it is advantageous for zooplankton to migrate to deep waters during the day to avoid predation and come up to the surface at night to feed. 
;Metabolic advantages: By feeding in the warm surface waters at night and residing in the cooler deep waters during the day they can conserve energy.  Alternatively, organisms feeding on the bottom in cold water during the day may migrate to surface waters at night in order to digest their meal at warmer temperatures.
;Dispersal and transport: Organisms can use deep and shallow currents to find food patches or to maintain a geographical location.
;Avoid UV damage: The sunlight can penetrate into the water column. If an organism, especially something small like a [[microbe]], is too close to the surface the UV can damage them. So they would want to avoid getting too close to the surface, especially during daylight.
'''Water transparency'''

A recent theory of DVM, termed the Transparency Regulator Hypothesis, argues that water transparency is the ultimate variable that determines the exogenous factor (or combination of factors) that causes DVM behavior in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Web of Science [v.5.20]  -      Web of Science Core Collection Full Record|url = http://apps.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=WOS&amp;SID=4AjAFO8aQteDGye4TkR&amp;UT=WOS%253A000294603500005&amp;SrcApp=EndNote&amp;DestFail=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.webofknowledge.com&amp;action=retrieve&amp;Init=Yes&amp;SrcAuth=ResearchSoft&amp;Func=Frame&amp;customersID=ResearchSoft&amp;IsProductCode=Yes&amp;mode=FullRecord|website = apps.webofknowledge.com|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less transparent waters, where fish are present and more food is available, fish tend to be the main driver of DVM. In more transparent bodies of water, where fish are less numerous and food quality improves in deeper waters, UV light can travel farther, thus functioning as the main driver of DVM in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does the fish presence influence the diurnal vertical distribution of zooplankton in high transparency lakes?|journal = Hydrobiologia|date = 2012-12-09|issn = 0018-8158|pages = 27–39|volume = 709|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10750-012-1405-5|first = Rocco|last = Tiberti|first2 = Rocco|last2 = Iacobuzio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unusual events ==
Due to the particular types of stimuli and cues used to initiate vertical migration, anomalies can change the pattern drastically.

For example, the occurrence of midnight sun in the Arctic induces changes to planktonic life that would normally perform DVM with a 24-hour night and day cycle. In the summers of the Arctic the Earth's north pole is directed toward the sun creating longer days and at the high latitude continuous day light for more than 24-hours. Species of foraminifera found in the ocean cease their DVM pattern, and rather remain at the surface in favor of feeding on the phytoplankton, for example ''Neogloboquadrina pachyderma'', and for those species that contain symbionts, like ''Turborotalita quinqueloba'', remain in sunlight to aid photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="C. Manno, A.K. Pavlov 285–295"/&gt;

There is also evidence of changes to vertical migration patterns during solar eclipse events. In the moments that the sun is obscured during normal day light hours, there is a sudden dramatic decrease in light intensity. The decreased light intensity, replicates the typical lighting experienced at night time that stimulate the planktonic organisms to migrate. During an eclipse, some copepod species distribution is concentrated near the surface, for example ''Calanus finmarchicus'' displays a classic diurnal migration pattern but on a much shorter time scale during an eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K. Sherman, K.A. Honey|first=|date=May 1970|title=Vertical movements of zooplankton during a solar eclipse|url=http://www.nature.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/2271156a0.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=227|issue=5263|pages=1156–1158|doi=10.1038/2271156a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance for the biological pump==

The [[biological pump]] is the conversion of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and inorganic nutrients by plant photosynthesis into [[Particle (ecology)|particulate]] organic matter in the [[euphotic zone]] and transference to the deeper ocean.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Deborah."&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steinberg | first= Deborah |author2=Sarah Goldthwait |author3=Dennis Hansell  |year=2002 | title=Zooplankton vertical migration and the active transport of dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen in the Sargasso Sea| journal=Deep-Sea Research Part I| volume=49 | pages=1445–1461 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VGB-46HFXF2-5&amp;_user=657938&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2002&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1493597039&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000035679&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=657938&amp;md5=cce92453ae63045d33db450ec07edbf1&amp;searchtype=a | issn=0967-0637 | doi=10.1016/S0967-0637(02)00037-7 | issue=8 | citeseerx= 10.1.1.391.7622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major process in the ocean and without vertical migration it wouldn’t be nearly as efficient. The deep ocean gets most of its nutrients from the higher water column when they  sink down in the form of [[marine snow]]. This is made up of dead or dying animals and microbes, fecal matter, sand and other inorganic material.

Organisms migrate up to feed at night so when they migrate back to depth during the day they defecate large sinking fecal pellets.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Deborah."/&gt; Whilst some larger fecal pellets can sink quite fast, the speed that organisms move back to depth is still faster. At night organisms are in the top 100 metres of the water column, but during the day they move down to between 800–1000 meters. If organisms were to defecate at the surface it would take the fecal pellets days to reach the depth that they reach in a matter of hours. Therefore, by releasing fecal pellets at depth they have almost 1000 metres less to travel to get to the deep ocean. This is something known as [[active transport]]. The organisms are playing a more active role in moving organic matter down to depths. Because a large majority of the deep sea, especially marine microbes, depends on nutrients falling down, the quicker they can reach the ocean floor the better.

[[Zooplankton]] and [[salps]] play a large role in the active transport of fecal pellets. 15–50% of zooplankton biomass is estimated to migrate, accounting for the transport of 5–45% of particulate organic nitrogen to depth.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Deborah."/&gt; Salps are large gelatinous plankton that can vertically migrate 800 meters and eat large amounts of food at the surface. They have a very long gut retention time, so fecal pellets usually are released at maximum depth. Salps are also known for having some of the largest fecal pellets. Because of this they have a very fast sinking rate, small [[detritus]] particles are known to aggregate on them. This makes them sink that much faster. So while currently there is still much research being done on why organisms vertically migrate, it is clear that vertical migration plays a large role in the active transport of dissolved organic matter to depth.&lt;ref name="Wiebe, P.H"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wiebe | first=P.H |author2=L.P.

[[File:Hydraulic dynamometer (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Early hydraulic dynamometer, with dead-weight torque measurement]]

A '''dynamometer''' or '''"dyno"''' for short, is a device for measuring [[force]], [[torque]], or [[Power (physics)|power]]. For example, the power produced by an [[Heat engine|engine]], [[Electric motor|motor]] or other rotating [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] can be calculated by simultaneously measuring torque and [[rotational speed]] ([[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]).

In addition to being used to determine the torque or power characteristics of a machine under test, dynamometers are employed in a number of other roles. In standard emissions testing cycles such as those defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], dynamometers are used to provide simulated road loading of either the engine (using an engine dynamometer) or full powertrain (using a chassis dynamometer). In fact, beyond simple power and torque measurements, dynamometers can be used as part of a testbed for a variety of engine development activities, such as the calibration of engine management controllers, detailed investigations into combustion behavior, and [[tribology]].

In the medical terminology, hand-held dynamometers are used for routine screening of grip and [[hand strength]], and the initial and ongoing evaluation of patients with hand trauma or dysfunction. They are also used to measure grip strength in patients where compromise of the cervical nerve roots or peripheral nerves is suspected.

In the [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], [[kinesiology]], and [[ergonomics]] realms, force dynamometers are used for measuring the back, grip, arm, and/or leg strength of athletes, patients, and workers to evaluate physical status, performance, and task demands. Typically the force applied to a lever or through a cable is measured and then converted to a moment of force by multiplying by the perpendicular distance from the force to the axis of the level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/courses/apa4311/dynamometry.pps health.uottawa.ca], Dynamometry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation of torque power (absorbing) dynamometers==
An absorbing dynamometer acts as a load that is driven by the prime mover that is under test (e.g. [[Pelton wheel]]). The dynamometer must be able to operate at any speed and load to any level of torque that the test requires.

Absorbing dynamometers are not to be confused with "inertia" dynamometers, which calculate power solely by measuring power required to accelerate a known mass drive roller and provide no variable load to the prime mover.

An absorption dynamometer is usually equipped with some means of measuring the operating torque and speed.

The power absorption unit (PAU) of a dynamometer absorbs the power developed by the prime mover. This power absorbed by the dynamometer is then converted into heat, which generally dissipates into the ambient air or transfers to cooling water that dissipates into the air. Regenerative dynamometers, in which the prime mover drives a DC motor as a generator to create load, make excess DC power and potentially - using a DC/AC inverter - can feed AC power back into the commercial electrical power grid.

Absorption dynamometers can be equipped with two types of control systems to provide different main test types.

===Constant force===
The dynamometer has a "braking" torque regulator - the power absorption unit is configured to provide a set braking force torque load, while the prime mover is configured to operate at whatever throttle opening, fuel delivery rate, or any other variable it is desired to test. The prime mover is then allowed to accelerate the engine through the desired speed or RPM range. Constant force test routines require the PAU to be set slightly torque deficient as referenced to prime mover output to allow some rate of acceleration. Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant. The constant varies depending on the units used.

===Constant speed===
If the dynamometer has a speed regulator (human or computer), the PAU provides a variable amount of braking force (torque) that is necessary to cause the prime mover to operate at the desired single test speed or RPM. The PAU braking load applied to the prime mover can be manually controlled or determined by a computer. Most systems employ eddy current, oil hydraulic, or DC motor produced loads because of their linear and quick load change abilities.

Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant, with the constant varying with the output unit desired and the input units used.

A ''motoring dynamometer'' acts as a motor that drives the equipment under test. It must be able to drive the equipment at any speed and develop any level of torque that the test requires. In common usage, AC or DC motors are used to drive the equipment or "load" device.

In most dynamometers [[Power (physics)|power]] (''P'') is not measured directly, but must be calculated from torque (''τ'') and angular velocity (''ω''){{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} values or force (''F'') and linear velocity (''v''):
:&lt;math&gt;P=\tau\cdot\omega&lt;/math&gt;
:or
:&lt;math&gt;P=F \cdot v&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P'' is the power in [[watt]]s
::''τ'' is the torque in [[newton metre]]s
::''ω'' is the angular velocity in [[radian per second|radians per second]]
::''F'' is the force in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s
::''v'' is the linear velocity in [[metre per second|metres per second]]

Division by a conversion constant may be required, depending on the units of measure used.

==Detailed dynamometer description==
[[Image:Dynamometer01CJC.svg|thumb|right|Electrical dynamometer setup showing engine, torque measurement arrangement and tachometer]]
A dynamometer consists of an absorption (or absorber/driver) unit, and usually includes a means for measuring torque and rotational speed. An absorption unit consists of some type of rotor in a housing. The rotor is coupled to the engine or other equipment under test and is free to rotate at whatever speed is required for the test. Some means is provided to develop a braking torque between the rotor and housing of the dynamometer. The means for developing torque can be frictional, hydraulic, electromagnetic, or otherwise, according to the type of absorption/driver unit.

One means for measuring torque is to mount the dynamometer housing so that it is free to turn except as restrained by a torque arm. The housing can be made free to rotate by using [[trunnion]]s connected to each end of the housing to support it in pedestal-mounted trunnion bearings. The torque arm is connected to the dyno housing and a [[weighing scale]] is positioned so that it measures the force exerted by the dyno housing in attempting to rotate. The torque is the force indicated by the scales multiplied by the length of the torque arm measured from the center of the dynamometer. A [[load cell]] [[transducer]] can be substituted for the scales in order to provide an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signal]] that is proportional to torque.

Another means to measure torque is to connect the engine to the dynamo through a [[torque sensor|torque sensing]] coupling or torque transducer. A torque transducer provides an electrical signal that is proportional to the torque.

With electrical absorption units, it is possible to determine torque by measuring the current drawn (or generated) by the absorber/driver. This is generally a less accurate method and not much practiced in modern times, but it may be adequate for some purposes.

When torque and speed signals are available, test data can be transmitted to a [[data acquisition]] system rather than being recorded manually. Speed and torque signals can also be recorded by a [[chart recorder]] or [[plotter]].

==Types of dynamometers==
In addition to classification as absorption, motoring, or universal, as described above, dynamometers can also be classified in other ways.

A dyno that is [[coupling|coupled]] directly to an engine is known as an ''engine dyno''.

A dyno that can measure torque and power delivered by the power train of a vehicle directly from the drive wheel or wheels (without removing the engine from the frame of the vehicle), is known as a ''chassis dyno''.

Dynamometers can also be classified by the type of absorption unit or absorber/driver that they use. Some units that are capable of absorption only can be combined with a motor to construct an absorber/driver or "universal" dynamometer.

===Types of absorption units===
* [[eddy current brake|Eddy current]] (absorption only)
* Magnetic powder brake (absorption only)
* [[Hysteresis]] brake (absorption only)
* [[Electric motor]]/[[Electric generator|generator]] (absorb or drive)
* Fan brake (absorption only)
* [[Hydraulic]] brake (absorption only)
* Force lubricated, oil shear friction brake (absorption only)
* [[Water brake]] (absorption only)
* Compound dyno (usually an absorption dyno in tandem with an electric/motoring dyno)

===Eddy current type absorber===
Eddy current (EC) dynamometers are currently the most common absorbers used in modern chassis dynos. The EC absorbers provide a quick load change rate for rapid load settling. Most are air cooled, but some are designed to require external water cooling systems.

Eddy current dynamometers require an electrically conductive core, shaft, or disc moving across a magnetic field to produce resistance to movement. Iron is a common material, but copper, aluminum, and other conductive materials are also usable.

In current (2009) applications, most EC brakes use cast iron discs similar to vehicle disc brake rotors, and use variable electromagnets to change the magnetic field strength to control the amount of braking.

The electromagnet voltage is usually controlled by a computer, using changes in the magnetic field to match the power output being applied.

Sophisticated EC systems allow steady state and controlled acceleration rate operation.

===Powder dynamometer===
A powder dynamometer is similar to an eddy current dynamometer, but a fine magnetic powder is placed in the air gap between the rotor and the coil. The resulting flux lines create "chains" of metal particulate that are constantly built and broken apart during rotation, creating great torque. Powder dynamometers are typically limited to lower RPM due to heat dissipation problems.

===Hysteresis dynamometers===
Hysteresis dynamometers use a magnetic rotor, sometimes of AlNiCo alloy, that is moved through flux lines generated between magnetic pole pieces. The magnetisation of the rotor is thus cycled around its B-H characteristic, dissipating energy proportional to the area between the lines of that graph as it does so.

Unlike eddy current brakes, which develop no torque at standstill, the hysteresis brake develops largely constant torque, proportional to its magnetising current (or magnet strength in the case of permanent magnet units) over its entire speed range&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magtrol.com/manuals/hbmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Units often incorporate ventilation slots, though some have provision for forced air cooling from an external supply.

Hysteresis and Eddy Current dynamometers are two of the most useful technologies in small ({{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} and less) dynamometers.

===Electric motor/generator dynamometer===
[[Electric motor]]/[[electric generator|generator]] dynamometers are a specialized type of [[adjustable-speed drive]]. The absorption/driver unit can be either an [[alternating current]] (AC) motor or a [[direct current]] (DC) motor. Either an AC motor or a DC motor can operate as a generator that is driven by the unit under test or a motor that drives the unit under test. When equipped with appropriate control units, electric motor/generator dynamometers can be configured as universal dynamometers. The control unit for an AC motor is a [[variable-frequency drive]], while the control unit for a DC motor is a [[Adjustable-speed drive#DC drives|DC drive]]. In both cases, regenerative control units can transfer power from the unit under test to the electric utility. Where permitted, the operator of the dynamometer can receive payment (or credit) from the utility for the returned power via [[net metering]].

In engine testing, universal dynamometers can not only absorb the power of the engine, but can also drive the engine for measuring friction, pumping losses, and other factors.

Electric motor/generator dynamometers are generally more costly and complex than other types of dynamometers.

===Fan brake===
A fan is used to blow air to provide engine load. The torque absorbed by a fan brake may be adjusted by changing the gearing or the fan itself, or by restricting the airflow through the fan. It should be noted that, due to the low [[viscosity]] of air, this variety of dynamometer is inherently limited in the amount of torque that it can absorb.

===Force lubricated oil shear brake===
An oil shear brake has a series of friction discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs is attached to the load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit.  Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.&lt;ref name=shear&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ien.com/article/slashing-test-time/187285 |title=Slashing Test Time with Oil Shear Brake |work=Industrial Equipment News |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydraulic brake===
The hydraulic brake system consists of a hydraulic pump (usually a gear-type pump), a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the pumps outlet is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest load change ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.

===Water brake-type absorber===
[[File:Tech-Talk_Animation_on_How_Water-Brakes_Work.webm|thumb|A  4-minute ‘how-it-works video’ tutorial explaining how engine-dynamometer water-brake absorbers work.]]
The [[water brake]] absorber is sometimes mistakenly called a "hydraulic dynamometer". Invented by British engineer [[William Froude]] in 1877 in response to a request by the [[Admiralty]] to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froudehofmann.com/about/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} About Us|publisher=Froude Hoffmann|accessdate=9 Jan 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302070601/http://www.froudehofmann.com/about/history/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; water brake absorbers are relatively common today. They are noted for their high power capability, small size, light weight, and relatively low manufacturing costs as compared to other, quicker reacting, "power absorber" types.

Their drawbacks are that they can take a relatively long period of time to "stabilize" their load amount, and that they require a constant supply of water to the "water brake housing" for cooling. In many parts of the country,{{Where|date=July 2011}} environmental regulations now prohibit "flow through" water, and so large water tanks must be installed to prevent contaminated water from entering the environment.

The schematic shows the most common type of water brake, known as the "variable level" type. Water is added until the engine is held at a steady RPM against the load, with the water then kept at that level and replaced by constant draining and refilling (which is needed to carry away the heat created by absorbing the horsepower). The housing attempts to rotate in response to the torque produced, but is restrained by the scale or torque metering cell that measures the torque.
[[Image:Dyno schematic.svg|frame|center|This schematic shows a water brake, which is actually a fluid coupling with a housing restrained from rotating&amp;mdash;similar to a water pump with no outlet.]]

===Compound dynamometers===
In most cases, motoring dynamometers are symmetrical; a 300&amp;nbsp;kW AC dynamometer can absorb 300&amp;nbsp;kW as well as motor at 300&amp;nbsp;kW. This is an uncommon requirement in engine testing and development. Sometimes, a more cost-effective solution is to attach a larger absorption dynamometer with a smaller motoring dynamometer. Alternatively, a larger absorption dynamometer and a simple AC or DC motor may be used in a similar manner, with the electric motor only providing motoring power when required (and no absorption). The (cheaper) absorption dynamometer is sized for the maximum required absorption, whereas the motoring dynamometer is sized for motoring. A typical size ratio for common emission test cycles and most engine development is approximately 3:1. Torque measurement is somewhat complicated since there are two machines in tandem - an inline torque transducer is the preferred method of torque measurement in this case. An eddy-current or waterbrake dynamometer, with electronic control combined with a variable frequency drive and AC induction motor, is a commonly used configuration of this type. Disadvantages include requiring a second set of test cell services (electrical power and cooling), and a slightly more complicated control system. Attention must be paid to the transition between motoring and braking in terms of control stability.

==How dynamometers are used for engine testing==
Dynamometers are useful in the development and refinement of modern engine technology. The concept is to use a dyno to measure and compare power transfer at different points on a vehicle, thus allowing the engine or drivetrain to be modified to get more efficient power transfer. For example, if an engine dyno shows that a particular engine achieves {{convert|400|N.m|lbf.ft|abbr=on|0|round=5}} of torque, and a chassis dynamo shows only {{convert|350|N.m|lbf.ft|abbr=on|0|round=5}}, one would know that the drivetrain losses are nominal. Dynamometers are typically very expensive pieces of equipment, and so are normally used only in certain fields that rely on them for a particular purpose.

==Types of dynamometer systems==
[[Image:boxsterdyno.png|right|thumb|300px|Dyno graph 1]]
[[Image:dynograph96.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Dyno graph 2]]

A 'brake' dynamometer applies variable load on the prime mover (PM) and measures the PM's ability to move or hold the RPM as related to the "braking force" applied. It is usually connected to a [[computer]] that records applied braking torque and calculates engine power output based on information from a "load cell" or "strain gauge" and a speed sensor.

An 'inertia' dynamometer provides a fixed inertial mass load, calculates the power required to accelerate that fixed and known mass, and uses a computer to record RPM and acceleration rate to calculate torque. The engine is generally tested from somewhat above idle to its maximum RPM and the output is measured and plotted on a [[Graph of a function|graph]].

A 'motoring' dynamometer provides the features of a brake dyno system, but in addition, can "power" (usually with an AC or DC motor) the PM and allow testing of very small power outputs (for example, duplicating speeds and loads that are experienced when operating a vehicle traveling downhill or during on/off throttle operations).

==Types of dynamometer test procedures==
There are essentially 3 types of dynamometer test procedures:

# Steady state: where the engine is held at a specified RPM (or series of usually sequential RPMs) for a desired amount of time by the variable brake loading as provided by the PAU (power absorber unit). These are performed with brake dynamometers.
# Sweep test: the engine is tested under a load (i.e. inertia or brake loading), but allowed to "sweep" up in RPM, in a continuous fashion, from a specified lower "starting" RPM to a specified "end" RPM. These tests can be done with inertia or brake dynamometers.
# Transient test: usually done with AC or DC dynamometers, the engine power and speed are varied throughout the test cycle. Different test cycles are used in different jurisdictions. Chassis test cycles include the US light-duty UDDS, HWFET, US06, SC03, ECE, EUDC, and CD34, while engine test cycles include ETC, HDDTC, HDGTC, WHTC, WHSC, and ED12.

===Types of sweep tests===
#'''Inertia sweep''': an inertia dyno system provides a fixed inertial mass flywheel and computes the power required to accelerate the flywheel (the load) from the starting to the ending RPM. The actual rotational mass of the engine (or engine and vehicle in the case of a chassis dyno) is not known, and the variability of even the mass of the tires will skew the power results. The inertia value of the flywheel is "fixed", so low-power engines are under load for a much longer time and internal engine temperatures are usually too high by the end of the test, skewing optimal "dyno" tuning settings away from the optimal tuning settings of the outside world. Conversely, high powered engines commonly complete a "4th gear sweep" test in less than 10 seconds, which is not a reliable load condition{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} as compared to operation in the real world. By not providing enough time under load, internal combustion chamber temperatures are unrealistically low and power readings - especially past the power peak - are skewed to the low side.
#'''Loaded sweep''', of the brake dyno type, includes:
## '''Simple fixed load sweep''': a fixed load - of somewhat less than the output of the engine - is applied during the test. The engine is allowed to accelerate from its starting RPM to its ending RPM, varying at its own acceleration rate, depending on power output at any particular rotational speed. Power is calculated using (rotational speed x torque x constant) + the power required to accelerate the dyno and engine's/vehicle's rotating mass.
## '''Controlled acceleration sweep''': similar in basic usage as the (above) simple fixed load sweep test, but with the addition of active load control that targets a specific rate of acceleration. Commonly, 20fps/ps is used.{{By whom|date=June 2011}}
#'''Controlled acceleration rate''': the acceleration rate used is controlled from low power to high power engines, and overextension and contraction of "test duration" is avoided, providing more repeatable tests and tuning results.

In every type of sweep test, there remains the issue of potential power reading error due to the variable engine/dyno/vehicle total rotating mass. Many modern computer-controlled brake dyno systems are capable of deriving that "inertial mass" value, so as to eliminate this error.{{Or|date=June 2011}}

A "sweep test" will almost always be suspect, as many "sweep" users ignore the rotating mass factor, preferring to use a blanket "factor" on every test on every engine or vehicle. Simple inertia dyno systems aren't capable of deriving "inertial mass", and thus are forced to use the same (assumed) inertial mass on every vehicle tested.

Using steady state testing eliminates the rotating inertial mass error of a sweep test, as there is no acceleration during this type of test.

===Transient test characteristics===
Aggressive throttle movements, engine speed changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual purpose of these tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost eddy-current dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required transient tests contain a significant amount of motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an eddy-current dyno will generate different emissions test results. Final adjustments are required to be done on a motoring-capable dyno.

===Engine dynamometer===
[[Image:TitanTestStand Rev2011.jpg|thumb|right|HORIBA engine dynamometer TITAN]]
An [[engine dynamometer]] measures power and torque directly from the engine's [[crankshaft]] (or [[flywheel]]), when the engine is removed from the vehicle. These dynos do not account for power losses in the drivetrain, such as the [[gearbox]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[differential (mechanics)|differential]].

===Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)===
{{main|Chassis dynamometer}}
[[Image:chassisdyno.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saab 96]] on chassis dynamometer]]
A [[chassis]] dynamometer, sometimes referred to as a rolling road,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rolling Road Dyno|url=http://www.tuningtools.co.uk/rolling-road-dyno-sales.html|work=Tuning Tools|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures power delivered to the surface of the "drive roller" by the drive [[wheel]]s. The vehicle is often parked on the roller or rollers, which the car then turns, and the output measured thereby.

Modern roller-type chassis dyno systems use the "Salvisberg roller",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=10&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=salvisberg&amp;OS=salvisberg&amp;RS=salvisberg|title=United States Patent: D798762 - Watch strap link|author=|date=|website=uspto.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which improves traction and repeatability, as compared to the use of smooth or [[Knurling|knurled]] drive rollers. Chassis dynamometers can be fixed or portable, and can do much more than display RPM, horsepower, and torque. With modern electronics and quick reacting, low inertia dyno systems, it is now possible to tune to best power and the smoothest runs in real time.

Other types of chassis dynamometers are available that eliminate the potential for wheel slippage on old style drive rollers, attaching directly to the vehicle hubs for direct torque measurement from the axle.

[[Motor vehicle emissions]] development and homologation dynamometer test systems often integrate emissions sampling, measurement, engine speed and load control, data acquisition, and safety monitoring into a complete test cell system. These test systems usually include complex emissions sampling equipment (such as constant volume samplers and raw [[exhaust gas]] sample preparation systems) and analyzers. These analyzers are much more sensitive and much faster than a typical portable exhaust gas analyzer. Response times of well under one second are common, and are required by many transient test cycles. In retail settings it is also common to tune the air-fuel ratio using a wideband [[oxygen sensor]] that is graphed along with the RPM.

Integration of the dynamometer control system with automatic calibration tools for engine system calibration is often found in development test cell systems. In these systems, the dynamometer load and engine speed are varied to many engine operating points, while selected engine management parameters are varied and the results recorded automatically. Later analysis of this data may then be used to generate engine calibration data used by the engine management software.

Because of frictional and mechanical losses in the various drivetrain components, the measured rear wheel brake horsepower is generally 15-20 percent less than the brake horsepower measured at the crankshaft or flywheel on an engine dynamometer.&lt;ref&gt;John Dinkel, "Chassis Dynamometer", ''Road and Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary'', (Bentley Publishers, 2000) p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Graham-Desaguliers Dynamometer was invented by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] and mentioned in the writings of [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desagulier]] in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Allen W. and Daryl E. Miller, 1998, Movement Skill Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; Desaguliers modified the first dynamometers, and so the instrument became known as the Graham-Desaguliers dynamometer.

The Regnier dynamometer was invented and made public in 1798 by [[Edmé Régnier L'Aîné|Edmé Régnier]], a French rifle maker and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Régnier, Edmé. Description et usage du dynamomètre, 1798.&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent was issued (dated June 1817)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0YOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA757&amp;dq=marriott's+patent+weighing+machine&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=L-XITq_lLaiB4ASfo5jcAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=marriott's+patent+weighing+machine&amp;f=false|title=The Engineer's and Mechanic's Encyclopædia: Comprehending Practical Illustrations of the Machinery and Processes Employed in Every Description of Manufacuture of the British Empire|first=Luke|last=Hebert|date=7 April 2018|publisher=Kelly|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1EoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=marriott+patent+weighing+machine+fleet+street&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dXpBfYJsnJ&amp;sig=1RMSAuTtewKrTUHUSNaa55S_72k&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=bu7IToarB-n04QT1qKgw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marriott+patent+weighing+machine+fleet+street&amp;f=false|title=The Monthly Magazine|author=|date=7 April 2018|publisher=R.

[[Gaspard de Prony]] invented the [[de Prony brake]] in 1821.

[[Macneill's road indicator]] was invented by [[John Benjamin Macneill|John Macneill]] in the late 1820s, further developing Marriot's patented weighing machine.

Froude Hofmann, of Worcester, UK, manufactures engine and vehicle dynamometers. They credit [[William Froude]] with the invention of the hydraulic dynamometer in 1877, and say that the first commercial dynamometers were produced in 1881 by their predecessor company, [[Heenan &amp; Froude]].

In 1928, the German company "''[[Carl Schenck]] Eisengießerei &amp; Waagenfabrik''" built the first vehicle dynamometers for brake tests that have the basic design of modern vehicle test stands.

The eddy current dynamometer was invented by Martin and Anthony Winther around 1931, but at that time, DC Motor/generator dynamometers had been in use for many years. A company founded by the Winthers brothers, Dynamatic Corporation, manufactured dynamometers in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] until 2002. Dynamatic was part of [[Eaton Corporation]] from 1946 to 1995. In 2002, Dyne Systems of [[Jackson, Washington County, Wisconsin|Jackson, Wisconsin]] acquired the Dynamatic dynamometer product line. Starting in 1938, Heenan &amp; Froude manufactured eddy current dynamometers for many years under license from Dynamatic and Eaton.&lt;ref name="Winther, Eddy currents" &gt;{{Cite book

A '''dystopia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δυσ- "bad" and τόπος "place"; alternatively, '''cacotopia''',&lt;ref name="Bentham"&gt;Cacotopia (from κακός ''kakos'' "bad") was the term used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his 19th century works ({{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326062103/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|archivedate=26 March 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-03-19|df=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230])&lt;/ref&gt; '''kakotopia''', or simply '''anti-utopia''') is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.&lt;ref name=Merriam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; It is translated as "not-good place" and is an [[antonym]] of [[utopia]], a term that was coined by [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and figures as the title of his best known work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.

Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories [[setting (narrative)|set]] in the future. Some of the most famous examples are [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Dystopias are often characterized by [[dehumanization]],&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tyrant|tyrannical]] governments, [[environmental disaster]],&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dystopia?q=dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, [[Environmental issues|environment]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[science]], or [[technology]]. However, some authors also use the term to refer to actually-existing societies, many of which are or have been [[totalitarian]] states, or societies in an advanced state of collapse and disintegration.

It should be noted that some scholars, such as [[Gregory Claeys]] and [[Lyman Tower Sargent]], make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the contemporaneous society in which the author writes, whereas '''anti-utopias''' function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24EUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Utopia Reader|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Though several earlier usages are known, ''dystopia'' was deployed as an antonym for ''[[Utopia]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tisdall |first=Nigel |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f94aa6a-a0f8-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Postcard from Belgium: the birthplace of utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of his Parliamentary Speeches 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1988 |title=Public and parliamentary speeches - Part I - November 1850 - November 1868 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/262 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-415-03791-3 |access-date=2015-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hansard Commons'') by adding the prefix "dys" ({{lang-grc|δυσ-}} "bad"), reinterpreting the initial ''U'' as the prefix "eu" ({{lang-grc|ευ-}} "good") instead of "ou" ({{lang-grc|οὐ}} "not"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: "It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable."&lt;ref name="Hermansson"&gt;[[Cf.]] [http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm "Dystopia Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503015002/http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm|date=3 May 2006}}, in ''Exploring Dystopia'', "edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')" (''hem.passagen.se''), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;!--This site appears to be a self-published website and its reliability may be dubious.

"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics."  The example of first usage given in the ''OED'' (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the ''OED'' include:

Decades before the first documented use of the word "dystopia" was "cacotopia" (using {{lang-grc|κακόs}}, "bad, wicked")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkako%2Fs κακόs], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; originally proposed in 1818 by [[Jeremy Bentham]]: "As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described."&lt;ref name="bentham"&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1818). ''Plan of Parliamentary Reform, in the form of a catechism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use, for example by [[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', who said it was a better fit for Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' because "it sounds worse than dystopia".&lt;ref name="beaumont"&gt;Beaumont, Matthew. (2006). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/summary/v073/73.2beaumont.html Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England's Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870-1900]. ''ELH, 73''(2): 465-487.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Common theme==

===Politics===
In ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', [[H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]] depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff153&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff147&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or "perfect worlds") are [[idealistic]] in principle and successfully result in positive consequences for the inhabitants,&lt;ref name="Utopia"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Utopia "Utopia"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed., 2004, ''[[Dictionary.com]]'', [[World Wide Web|Web]], 11 Feb. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one [[fatal flaw]].&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;[[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], ''Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature'', ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii.  {{ISBN|0-87436-757-3}} (10).  {{ISBN|978-0-87436-757-7}} (13).&lt;!--not verified.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopias are often filled with [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an "iron hand" or "iron fist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a "[[Resistance movement|resistance]]" to enact change within their society, as is seen in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref name=Donawerth&gt;Jane Donawerth, "Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia", in ''Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination'', ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (book)|Divergent]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''; and in such films as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]''.

===Economics===
The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. However, there are several [[archetypes]] that such societies tend to follow.

A commonly occurring theme is the dichotomy of [[Planned economy|planned economies]] versus [[free market]] economies, a conflict which is found in such works as [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''Anthem'' and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s short story "The Iron Standard". Another example of this is reflected in [[Norman Jewison]]'s 1975 film ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''.

Some dystopias, such as that of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', feature [[black market]]s with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain, or the characters may be totally at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful, but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial and unsatisfying, and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. Segal, "Vonnegut's ''Player Piano'': An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia," 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'', there is no want of any kind &amp;ndash; only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tanith. ''Don't Bite the Sun''. Bantam Books:1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in ''Brave New World'', the state often controls the economy. In ''Brave New World'', a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On Brave New World" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works feature extensive [[privatization]] and [[corporatism]]; both byproducts of [[capitalism]], where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have effectively replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, or otherwise [[corporate republic|function as government]]. This is seen in the novels ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' and the movies ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Visioneers]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', ''Soylent Green'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''. Corporate republics common in the [[cyberpunk]] genre, as in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (as well as the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', loosely based on Dick's novel).

====Social stratification====
Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working classes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the novel ''Brave New World'', written in 1931 by [[Aldous Huxley]], a class system is prenatally designated in terms of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that still exist in the ''conventional'' way but which the class system describe as "savages".

In ''Ypsilon Minus'' by [[Herbert W. Franke]], people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.

===Family===
Some fictional dystopias, such as ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', have eradicated the family and deploy continuing efforts to keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In ''Brave New World'', where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts "mother" and "father" are considered obscene.  In some novels, the State is hostile to motherhood: for example, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', children are organized to spy on their parents; and in ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], the escape of a pregnant woman from One State is a revolt.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp&gt;Gorman Beauchamp, "Zamiatin's ''We''" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In ''Brave New World'', for example, the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them "T"s, (as symbols of [[Ford Model T|Henry Ford's Model T]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 94, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', on the other hand, takes place in a future United States under a Christianity-based theocratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atwood, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', McClelland and Stewart, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7710-0813-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of this theme is [[Robert Hugh Benson]]'s ''[[Lord of the World]]'', about a futuristic world where the [[Freemasons]] have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a [[Roman Catholic]] minority.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Identity===
In the Russian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names.

In some dystopian works, such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', society forces individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to radical [[egalitarian]] social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.

===Violence===
[[Violence]] is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of [[war]] (e.g. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''); urban crimes led by gangs (often of teenagers) (e.g. ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''); rampant crime met by [[blood sport]]s (e.g. ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]''). Also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay "Ground Zero", where she explains her experience with the aftermath of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berne|first1=Suzanne|title=Patterns for College Writing|journal=Ground Zero|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;"Avatism and Utopia" 4, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.{{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', as well as within Bradbury's short story "[[The Pedestrian]]."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In ''Brave New World'', the lower classes of society are conditioned to be afraid of nature, but also to visit the countryside and consume transportation and games to promote economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=Brave New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois Lowry's "[[The Giver]]", in a manner similar to Brave New World, shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species, and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against basic human instincts. [[E. M. Forster]]'s "[[The Machine Stops]]" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|date=2014|title=Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/angulo/volumen/Volumen06-2/articulos05.htm|journal=Ángulo Recto.

Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''Soylent Green''.  A few "green" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in [[Michael Carson (author)|Michael Carson]]'s short story "[[The Punishment of Luxury]]", and [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]''. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, "a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the [[Iron Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
Contrary to the [[Technological utopianism|technologically utopian]] claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Rushkoff, D. (2002). Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative.Explorations in Media Ecology, 1(1), 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical dystopian claims====
1. ''Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
[[Jaron Lanier]], a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. “I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility,” he says.

“‘Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.’ ‘There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it’” (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, D. (2013, July 3). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2. ''Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Rosenbaum, R. (2013, January 1). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the-web-165260940/?all&amp;no-ist&lt;/ref&gt;''
* decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use
* virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays

3. ''Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). ''
[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers “re-mystified” the computer so it wasn’t so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

4. ''New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''

5. ''The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
“ ‘The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.’”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

6. ''More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Heitman, B. (2011, April 13). The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood.(Books)(Book review). The Christian Science Monitor, 146-150.&lt;/ref&gt;''
In his article “Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem “it is meant to solve.” Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

7. ''New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine’s example of Indonesians “‘whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied.” Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

8. ''Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). ''
The need for business replaced community and the “story online” replaced people as the “soul of the Net.” Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In a 1967 study [[Frank Kermode]] suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.&lt;ref name=jstor1/&gt;

You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of [[global warming|our planet warming up]]. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">The '''European Space Information System''' (ESIS) project was initiated in 1988 as a service for homogeneous access to heterogeneous databases on the network. At the time, [[DECNET]], EARN and Bitnet were the main academic links. The project pre-dated the World Wide Web, which immensely pushed technology in 1993 to allow homogeneous access to data.

Initially, the ESIS project was to link databases of the [[European Space Agency]] together with centres of excellence that included the [[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] and its [[SIMBAD]] service, the [[European Southern Observatory]] and the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre (CADC), as well as the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] for Space Physics data &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m11524u2g46307u6/ The European Space Information System (ESIS) P. Giommi, S.G. Ansari, P. Donzelli, A. Micol, 1995, Experimental Astronomy Vol. 6 No. 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the project yielded a set of applications to browse catalogues, access images, spectra and lightcurves, as well as access to bibliographic information. The main astronomical missions that influenced ESIS at the time were the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[EXOSAT]] and [[International Ultraviolet Explorer|IUE]], while Space Physics was mainly focused on the [[Cluster mission]]. 

Having been a pioneer project in its days, many of the original concepts used then (such as catalogue browsing, searching in an area of the sky) were later embedded in other astronomical data services worldwide. ESIS provided the building blocks and the prototypes to what is today being implemented in the Virtual Observatory projects, such as the [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].

The greatest success of ESIS was the transfer of its Catalogue Browser to the CDS, which later became better known as the [[VizieR]] Catalogue Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet86/ansa86.htm Transfer of ESIS to scientific institutes S.G.

[[File:Todd Huffman - Lattice (by).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Honeybee]] workers collaborating on a comb have given up their ability to reproduce, an extreme expression of [[eusocial]] behavior.]]

[[Eusociality]] evolved repeatedly in different orders of [[animal]]s, particularly the [[Hymenoptera]] (the [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[ant]]s). This 'true sociality' in animals, in which sterile individuals work to further the reproductive success of others, is found in [[termites]], [[ambrosia beetles]], gall-dwelling [[aphids]], [[thrips]], marine sponge-dwelling shrimp (''[[Synalpheus]] regalis''), [[naked mole-rat]]s (''Heterocephalus glaber''), and the insect order [[Hymenoptera]] (which includes bees, wasps, and ants).&lt;ref name=andersson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = M. | year = 1984 | title = Evolution of eusociality | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. | volume = 15 | pages = 165–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that eusociality has evolved so often in the Hymenoptera (between 8 and 11 times&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt;), but remains rare throughout the rest of the animal kingdom, has made its evolution a topic of debate among evolutionary biologists. [[Eusocial]] organisms at first appear to behave in stark contrast with simple interpretations of [[Darwinian evolution]]: passing on one’s genes to the next generation, or [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], is a central idea in [[evolutionary biology]].

Current theories propose that the evolution of eusociality occurred either due to [[kin selection]], proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton]],&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | year = 1964 | title = The genetical theory of social behaviour, I, II | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | pages = 1–52 | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 | pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the competing theory of [[Group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multilevel selection]] as proposed by [[E.O. Wilson]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt; No single trait or model is sufficient to explain the evolution of eusociality, and most likely the pathway to eusociality involved a combination of pre-conditions, ecological factors, and genetic influences.

==Overview of eusociality==
{{main|Eusociality}}
Eusociality can be characterized by four main criteria: overlapping generations, cooperative brood care, [[philopatry]], and reproductive altruism.&lt;ref name=honeycutt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honeycutt | first1 = R | year = 1992 | title = Naked mole-rats | url = | journal = Am. Scientist | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 43–53 | bibcode = 1992AmSci..80...43H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlapping generations means that multiple generations live together, and that older offspring may help the parents raise their siblings.  Cooperative brood care is when individuals other than the parents assist in raising the offspring through means such as food gathering and protection.  Philopatry is when individuals remain living in their birthplace.

The final category, reproductive altruism, is the most divergent from other social orders.  [[Altruism]] occurs when an individual performs a behavior that benefits a recipient in some way, but at the individual’s own expense.&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; Reproductive altruism is one of the most extreme forms of altruism.  This is when most members of the group give up their own breeding opportunities in order to participate in the reproductive success of other individuals.&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt; The individuals giving up their own reproductive success form a sterile caste of workers within the group.  Each species that practices reproductive altruism is ruled by a queen, the only breeding female who is larger than the rest.  The remainder of the society is composed of a few breeding males, sterile male and female workers, and the young.&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt;

== Early hypotheses ==

[[Charles Darwin]] considered the evolution of eusociality a major problem for his theory of [[natural selection]]. In ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', he described the existence of sterile worker castes in the social insects as "the one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable and actually fatal to my whole theory". In the next paragraph of his book, Darwin describes a solution. If the trait of sterility can be carried by some individuals without expression, and those individuals that do express sterility help reproductive relatives, the sterile trait can persist and evolve.&lt;ref name=darwin&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, C.]] (1859) [[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life]]. John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was on the right track, except sterility is not a characteristic shared among all eusocial animals. Sterile workers of many eusocial species are not actually physiologically sterile. Male workers can still produce sperm, and female workers sometimes lay eggs, and in some species, become the new queen if the old one dies (observed in Hymenoptera, [[termites]], and shrimp).&lt;ref name=andersson/&gt;&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt;

This insight led to [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] becoming important theories during the 20th century to help explain eusociality. Inclusive fitness is described as a combination of one's own reproductive success and the reproductive success of others that share similar genes.&lt;ref name=andersson/&gt;  Animals may increase their inclusive fitness through kin selection.  Kin selection is when individuals help close relatives with their reproduction process, seemingly because relatives will propagate some of the individual's own genes.  Kin selection follows [[Hamilton's Rule]], which suggests that if the benefit of a behavior to a recipient, taking into account the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the altruist, outweighs the costs of the behavior to the altruist, then it is in the altruist's genetic advantage to perform the altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt;

== Current theories ==

===Haplodiploidy/Kin selection===
{{main|Haplodiploidy|Kin selection}}

[[William D. Hamilton]] proposed that eusociality arose in social Hymenoptera by kin selection because of their interesting genetic sex determination trait of [[haplodiploid]]y. Because males are produced by [[parthenogenesis]] (they come from unfertilized eggs and thus only have one set of chromosomes), and females are produced from fertilized eggs, sisters from a singly-mated mother share 75% of their genes, whereas mothers share only 50% of their genes with their offspring. Thus, sisters will propagate their own genes more by helping their mothers to raise more sisters, than to leave the nest and raise their own daughters.&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt;

Though Hamilton's argument appears to work well for Hymenoptera, it excludes diploid eusocial organisms (inter-sibling relatedness ≤ parent-offspring relatedness = 0.5). Even in haplodiploid systems, the average relatedness between sisters falls off rapidly when a queen mates with multiple males (r=0.5 for 2 mates, and even lower for more). Moreover, males share only 25% of their sisters' genes, and, in cases of equal sex ratios, females are related to their siblings on average by 0.5 which is no better than raising their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = K. | last2 = Wenseleers | first2 = T. | last3 = Ratnieks | first3 = F. | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2005.11.020 | title = Kin selection is the key to altruism | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 57 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the shortcomings of the haplodiploidy hypothesis, it is still considered to have some importance. For example, many bees have female-biased sex ratios and/or invest less in or kill males. Analysis has shown that in Hymenoptera, the ancestral female was monogamous in each of the eight independent cases where eusociality evolved.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = W. O. H. | last2 = Oldroyd | first2 = B. P. | last3 = Beekman | first3 = M. | last4 = Ratnieks | first4 = F. L. W. | title = Ancestral Monogamy Shows Kin Selection is Key to the Evolution of Eusociality | doi = 10.1126/science.1156108 | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5880 | pages = 1213–1216 | year=2008 | pmid =18511689| bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1213H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the high relatedness between sisters favored the evolution of eusociality during the initial stages on several occasions. This helps explain the abundance of eusocial genera within the order Hymenoptera, including three separate origins within halcitid bees alone.&lt;ref name=Danforth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Danforth |first1=Bryan |title=Evolution of sociality in a primitively eusocial lineage of bees |date=October 29, 2001 |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=286–290 |doi=10.1073/pnas.012387999 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/1/286.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=117553 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99..286D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monogamy===
The monogamy hypothesis, formulated by [[Jacobus Boomsma]] in 2007, is currently the leading hypothesis concerning the initial evolution of eusociality in the Hymenoptera. It uses Hamilton's kin selection approach in a way that applies to both haploid and diploid organisms. If a queen is lifetime-strictly [[monogamous]] - in other words, she mates with only one individual during her entire life - her progeny will be equally related to their siblings and to their own offspring (r=0.5 in both cases - this is an average of sisters [0.75] and brothers [0.25]). Thus, natural selection will favor cooperation in any situation where it's more efficient to raise siblings than offspring, and this could start paving a path towards eusociality. This higher efficiency becomes especially pronounced after group living evolves.&lt;ref name=boomsma07&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boomsma | first1=J. | year=2007 | title=Kin selection versus sexual selection: why the ends do not meet | journal=Current Biology | volume=17 | issue=| pages=R673–R683 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.033 | pmid=17714661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boomsma09&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boomsma | first1=J. | year=2009 | title=Lifetime monogamy and the evolution of eusociality | journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B | volume=364 | issue=| pages=3191–3208 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0101| pmc=2781870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many monogamous animals, an individual's death prompts its partner to look for a new mate, which would affect relatedness and hinder the evolution of eusociality: workers would be much more related to their offspring than their siblings. However, many Hymenoptera have a form of lifetime monogamy in which the queen mates with a single male, who then dies before colony founding. This seems to be the ancestral state in all Hymenopteran lineages that have evolved eusociality.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; Most termites also have a mating system in which a reproductive female (the queen) commits to a single male for life (the king), and this pattern seems to be ancestral in termites.&lt;ref name=boomsma07/&gt; Lastly, strict monogamy facilitated eusociality in the sponge-dwelling shrimp.&lt;ref name=duffy10&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duff | first1=J. E. | last2=Macdonald | first2=K. S. | year=2010 | title=Kin structure, ecology and the evolution of social organization in shrimp: a comparative analysis | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=277 | pages=575–584 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1483 | pmid=19889706 | pmc=2842683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inbreeding===

In species where philopatry predominates, and there are few emigrants to the nest, intense [[inbreeding]] can occur, as is the case in eusocial species.  Inbreeding can mimic and even surpass the effects of haplodiploidy.  Siblings may actually share greater than 75% of their genes.  Like in haplodiploidy kin selection, the individuals can propagate their own genes more through the promotion of more siblings, rather than their own offspring.&lt;ref name=andersson/&gt;&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt; For example, the need for dispersal and aggregation of multiclonal groups may have helped to drive the evolution of eusociality in aphids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Abbot |first=Patrick |date=October 2009 |title=On the evolution of dispersal and altruism in aphids |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00744.x |journal=Evolution |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=2687–2696 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00744.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Termites ===

In termites, two additional hypotheses have been proposed.  The first is the Chromosomal Linkage Hypothesis, where much of the termite genome is sex-linked.  This makes sisters related somewhat above 50%, and brothers somewhat above 50%, but brother-sister relatedness less than 50%.  Termite workers might then bias their cooperative brood care towards their own sex. This hypothesis also mimics the effects of haplodiploidy, but proposes that males would help raise only the queen's male offspring, while females would only care for the queen's female offspring.&lt;ref name=thorne&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thorne | first1 = B | year = 1997 | title = Evolution of eusociality in termites | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. | volume = 28 | pages = 27–54 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.27| pmc = 411731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbiont hypothesis in termites is quite different from the others.  With each molt, termites lose the lining of their hindgut and the subsequent bacteria and protozoa that colonize their guts for cellulose digestion.  They depend on interactions with other termites for their gut to be recolonized, thus forcing them to become social.  This could be a precursor, or pre-condition for why eusociality evolved in termites.&lt;ref name=thorne/&gt;

===Pre-conditions===

Although the symbiont hypothesis serves as a pre-condition for termites to evolve into eusocial societies, scientists have found two crucial pre-conditions for the evolution of eusociality across all species.  These include: 1. [[Altricial]] offspring (require large amounts of parental care to reach maturity); 2. Low reproductive success rates of solitary pairs that attempt to reproduce.&lt;ref name=andersson/&gt; These pre-conditions led to the two lifestyle characteristics that are observed in all eusocial species: nest building and extensive parental care.

===Ecological factors===

Ecological factors were also probably a precursor to eusociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourke |first1=A. F. |title=Colony size, social complexity and reproductive conflict in social insects |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |date=1999 |volume=12 |pages=245–257 |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=L. |title=Ecology, Not the Genetics of Sex Determination, Determines Who Helps in Eusocial Populations|journal=Current Biology |date=2013 |volume=23 |pages=2383–2387 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the sponge-dwelling shrimp depend upon the sponge's feeding current for food, termites depend upon dead, decaying wood, and naked mole rats depend upon tubers in the ground.&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt;&lt;ref name=thorne/&gt;&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = J | year = 1996 | title = Eusociality in a coral reef shrimp | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = | pages = 512–514 | doi=10.1038/381512a0 | bibcode=1996Natur.381..512D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these resources has patchy distributions throughout the environments of these animals.  This means there is a high cost to dispersing (individual may not find another source before it starves), and these resources must be defended for the group to survive.  These requirements make it a necessity to have high social order for the survival of the group.&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt;&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt;

=== Genetic influences ===

Genetic constraints may have influenced the evolution of eusociality. The genome structure of the order Hymenoptera has been found to have the highest [[recombination rate]]s of any other groups in Animalia. The eusocial genus ''[[Honey bee|Apis]]'', the honeybees, have the highest recombination rate in higher eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Kent2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kent et al.|year=2012|title=Recombination is associated with the evolution of genome structure and worker behavior in honey bees|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1208094109 |pages=18012–18017 |bibcode=2012PNAS..10918012K |pmc=3497793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilfert2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilfert et al.|year=2007|title=Variation in genomic recombination rates among animal taxa and the case of social insects |journal=Heredity|volume=98|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800950|pages=189–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes determining [[worker bee|worker]] behavior and division of labor have been found in regions of the ''Apis'' genome with the highest rates of recombination and molecular evolution.&lt;ref name="Kent2012" /&gt; These mechanisms are likely important to the evolution of eusociality because high recombination rates are associated with the creation of novel genes, upon which [[natural selection]] can act.&lt;ref name="Wilfert2007"/&gt; This could have been important in other eusocial genera. Biased gene conversion rates are also higher in eusocial species.&lt;ref name="Kent2012" /&gt; This could increase genotypic diversity, which could allow workers to meet the demands of a changing social structure more easily.&lt;ref name="Wilfert2007" /&gt; Another hypothesis is that the lower overall genetic diversity as eusociality levels increase throughout the family ''Apidae''is due to a decreased exposure to parasites and pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapheim et al|year=2015|title=Genomic signatures of evolutionary transitions from solitary to group living|journal=Science|volume=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodard et al.|year=2011|title=Genes involved in convergent evolution eusociality in bees|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=108|doi=10.1073/pnas.1103457108|pages=7472–7477|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.7472W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

===Manipulation===
Eusociality appears to be maintained through manipulation of the sterile workers by the queen.&lt;ref name=andersson/&gt; The mechanisms for this include hormonal control through pheromones, restricting food to young in order to control their size, consumption of any eggs laid by females other than the queen, and behavioral dominance.  In naked mole rats, this behavioral dominance occurs in the form of the queen facing the worker head-to-head, and shoving it throughout the tunnels of the naked mole rats' burrow for quite a distance.&lt;ref name=honeycutt/&gt;

===Group selection===
{{main|Group selection}}
Nowak, et al. (2010) outlines a path by which eusociality could evolve by means of multi-level (group) selection in five steps:&lt;ref name=nowak&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Nowak et al | first1 =  | year = 2010 | title =  The evolution of eusociality| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = | pages = 1057–1062 | doi = 10.1038/nature09205 | pmid = 20740005 | pmc=3279739| bibcode =2010Natur.466.1057N}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Formation of groups: Groups could consist of parent-offspring groups or unrelated groups (in situations where cooperation is beneficial) living in a structured nest.
# Pre-adaptations: Pre-adaptations for social living, such as progressive provisioning, will push the group further toward eusociality.
# Mutations: Mutations will arise and be selected. Some genes are known to have been silenced in social insect history, leading to the reduction of dispersal behavior and the origin of the wingless caste.
# Natural Selection Acts on Emergent Traits: The interactions of the individuals can be considered as part of the extended phenotype of the queen. These interactions produce emergent properties upon which natural selection can act.
# [[Multi-level selection]]: More cooperative groups out-compete less cooperative groups.

Nowak's paper, however, received major criticisms for erroneously separating inclusive fitness theory from "standard natural selection".  Over 150 authors replied &lt;ref name="response to Nowak"&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Abbot, P. et al.  | year=2011 | title=Inclusive fitness theory and eusociality | journal=Nature | volume=471 |issue=7339 | pages=E1–E4 | doi=10.1038/nature09831 | pmid=21430721 | pmc=3836173| bibcode=2011Natur.471E...1A }}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Nowak, et al. misrepresent 40 years of empirical literature.

'''Forward anonymity''', analogous to [[forward secrecy]], in [[computer security]] and [[cryptography]] is the property which prevents an attacker who has recorded past communications from discovering the identities of the participants, even after the fact.

When speaking of forward secrecy, system designers attempt to prevent an attacker who has recorded past communications from discovering the contents of said communications later on. One example of a system which satisfies the perfect forward secrecy property is one in which a compromise of one key by an attacker (and consequent [[decryption]] of messages encrypted with that key) does not undermine the security of previously used keys. Forward secrecy does not refer to protecting the content of the message, but rather to the protection of keys used to decrypt messages.

One example of a system which uses forward anonymity is a [[public key cryptography]] system, where the public key is well-known and used to [[encrypt]] a message, and an unknown private key is used to decrypt it. In this system, one of the keys is always said to be compromised, but messages and their participants are still unknown by anyone without the corresponding private key.

==History==
Originally introduced by  [[Whitfield Diffie]], [[Paul van Oorschot]], and Michael James Wiener to describe a property of STS ([[station-to-station protocol]]) involving a long term secret, either a private key or a shared password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diffie |first1=Whitfield |last2=Van Oorschot |first2=Paul C. |last3=Wiener |first3=Michael J. |title=Authentication and authenticated key exchanges |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |date=June 1992 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1007/BF00124891 |url=http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/papers/sts-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Key Cryptography==
Public Key Cryptography is a common form of a forward anonymous system. It is used to pass encrypted messages, preventing any information about the message from being discovered if the message is intercepted by an attacker. It uses two keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is published, and is used by anyone to encrypt a [[plaintext]] message. The Private key is not well known, and is used to decrypt [[cyphertext]]. Public key cryptography is known as an asymmetric decryption algorithm because of different keys being used to perform opposing functions. Public key cryptography is popular because, while it is computationally easy to create a pair of keys, it is extremely difficult to determine the private key knowing only the public key. Therefore, the public key being well known does not allow messages which are intercepted to be decrypted. This is a forward anonymous system because one compromised key (the public key) does not compromise the anonymity of the system.

==Web of Trust==
A variation of the public key cryptography system is a [[Web of trust]], where each user has both a public and private key. Messages sent are encrypted using the intended recipient's public key, and only this recipient's private key will decrypt the message. They are also signed with the senders private key. This creates added security where it becomes more difficult for an attacker to pretend to be a user, as the lack of a private key signature indicates a non-trusted user.

==Limitations==
A forward anonymous system does not necessarily mean a wholly secure system. A successful [[cryptanalysis]] of a message or sequence of messages can still decode the information without the use of a private key or long term secret.

==News==
Forward anonymity, along with other cryptography related properties, received a burst of media attention after the leak of classified information by [[Edward Snowden]], beginning in June, 2013, which indicated that the [[NSA]] and [[FBI]] had practices of asking companies to leave in back doors for them, allowing the companies and agencies to decrypt information stored on phones and other devices more easily, with the intention of allowing them to more easily find and arrest various criminals, while occasionally mistakenly targeting innocent civilians. They especially publicized the aid this practice provided in catching predatory [[pedophiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pagliery |first1=Jose |title=FBI director: iPhones shields pedophiles from cops |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/13/technology/security/fbi-apple/ |publisher=CNN |date=14 October 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116194600/http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/13/technology/security/fbi-apple/ |archivedate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this practice argue that leaving in a back door to law enforcement increases the risk of attackers being able to decrypt information, as well as questioning its legality under the [[US Constitution]], specifically being a form of illegal [[Search and Seizure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=van den Heuvel |first1=Katrina |last2=Cohen |first2=Stephen |title=Edward Snowden: A ‘Nation’ Interview |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |work=[[The Nation]] |date=28 October 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204105726/http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |archivedate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">The '''Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)''' is a spatial database of the [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world. It is a project of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]]. 

==Mission==
The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable geographic information on [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world, thereby contributing to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. In this framework, its purposes are:

* to overcome the fragmentation of the global dataset occurring when administrative units layers are digitized on a country-by-country basis
* to keep historical track of changes occurring on the shapes and extent of the administrative units
* to promote a unified [[georeference|coding]] system that reduces maintenance efforts.

==Characteristics==
The GAUL always maintains global geographic layers (in [[shapefile]] format) with a unified coding system at the levels of country, first administrative (e.g. regions), and second administrative (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country-by-country basis down to third, fourth and lower levels. The target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, universities, and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. 

Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial [[border|boundaries]] can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain [[territorial dispute|disputed]] areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries.

The coastline of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by the UN Cartographic Section except for some countries (e.g. [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. [[Landsat program|Landsat]] ETM). For future releases of the GAUL, the process of updating the coastline will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.

The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that have been changed, added, or deleted in the past. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named the '''GAUL Set'''. The GAUL project does not implement changes dated before 1990.

GAUL codes are numeric and unique for all administrative units at any of the administrative hierarchical level. Any GAUL code is independent from the codes of its higher administrative levels. GAUL codes assigned to administrative units of a given country are not necessarily sequential numbers. The main benefit of the GAUL Coding System is that changing in the codes of an administrative unit might not imply a change of codes of the correspondent units at lower levels. This means that the effort to maintain the links between thematic data and associated administrative units is reduced to a minimum.

==Organization==
The implementation of the GAUL initiative is based on a collaborative work among international agencies and national authorities generating and collecting spatial information on administrative units. The role of FAO is to keep this network of collaborators active, to evaluate and compile data from available sources, to establish procedures for data integration, to generate the GAUL codes and periodically to disseminate the GAUL Set. The overall methodology consists in:

# collecting the best available data from most reliable sources
# establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible)
# adding selected data to the global layer based on the international boundaries provided by the UN Cartographic Unit
# generating codes using the GAUL Coding System
# distributing data to the users

The GAUL has a consistent framework for the delivery of the data. Once a year, an updated version of the GAUL set is released through [http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/ Geonetwork].  A new version includes all updates made in the course of the previous year. The dataset is free of charge and it can be downloaded by login (to receive an account, just send an email to the contacts listed at the bottom of this article). The new version GAUL 2009 will be available on Geonetwork from January 2009.

'''Gonocyte''' is a term created in 1957 by scientists Yves Clermont and Bernard Perey. Gonocytes relate to both fetal and neonatal germ cells from the point at which they enter the testis primordia until they reach the base membrane at the seminiferous cords and differentiate. It is responsible for [[gametogenesis]], which is [[spermatogenesis]] in males and [[oogenesis]] in females. Gonocytes include gametogonia (spermatogonia and oogonia), oocytes, ootids, and ova. The overall structures of fetal and postnatal gonocytes are described as large and spherical, with a prominent nucleus and two nucleoli.

[[File:PetraAqueduct.jpg|thumb|Aqueduct in [[Petra, Jordan]].]]
The '''history of water supply and sanitation''' is one of a [[logistics|logistical]] challenge to provide [[Water supply|clean water]] and [[sanitation]] systems since the dawn of [[civilization]]. Where water resources, infrastructure or sanitation systems were insufficient, diseases spread and people fell sick or died prematurely. 

Major human settlements could initially develop only where fresh surface water was plentiful, such as near rivers or [[natural springs]]. Throughout history, people have devised systems to make getting water into their communities and households and disposing (and later also treating) [[wastewater]] more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/22932774/The_Art_of_Plumbing_as_Recorded_through_History|title=The Art of Plumbing as Recorded through History|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical focus of [[sewage treatment]] was on the conveyance of raw sewage to a natural body of water, e.g. a [[river]] or [[ocean]], where it would be diluted and dissipated. Early [[human]] habitations were often built next to water sources. Rivers would often serve as a crude form of natural sewage disposal.

Over the millennia, technology has dramatically increased the distances across which water can be relocated. Furthermore, treatment processes to purify [[drinking water]] and to treat wastewater have been improved.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Skara Brae]], a Neolithic village in [[Orkney]], Scotland with home furnishings including [[Flush toilet|water-flushing toilets]] 3180 BC–2500 BC]]
 
During the [[Neolithic]], humans dug the first permanent [[water well]]s, from where vessels could be filled and carried by hand. Wells dug around 6500&amp;nbsp;BC have been found in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashkenazi|first=Eli|title=Ancient well reveals secrets of first Jezreel Valley farmers|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/ancient-well-reveals-secrets-of-first-jezreel-valley-farmers-1.476288|work=haaretz.com|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=Nov 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of human settlements was largely dependent on nearby available water.

A primitive indoor, tree bark lined, two-channel, stone, fresh and wastewater system appears to have featured in the houses of in [[Skara Brae]], from around 3000 BCE, along with a cell-like enclave in a number of houses, that it has been suggested may have functioned as an early indoor toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginenthal|first1=Charles|title=Pillars of the Past Volume Four|date=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329747944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indus Valley Civilization ===
{{Further information|Sanitation in the Indus Valley Civilization}}
[[File:WellAndBathingPlatforms-Harappa.jpg|right|thumb|A large well and bathing platforms at [[Harappa]], remains of the city's final phase of occupation from 2200 to 1900&amp;nbsp; BC.]]
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in Asia shows [[Sanitation in the Indus Valley Civilization|early evidence of public water supply and sanitation]]. The system the Indus developed and managed included a number of advanced features. A typical example is the Indus city of [[Lothal]] (c. 2350 BCE). In Lothal all houses had their own private toilet which was connected to a covered sewer network constructed of brickwork held together with a gypsum-based mortar that emptied either into the surrounding water bodies or alternatively into [[cesspit]]s, the latter of which were regularly emptied and cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Saifullah|title=1 Chapter 2 Sanitation and wastewater technologies in Harappa/Indus valley civilization ( ca . 2600-1900 BC)|url=https://www.academia.edu/5937322/Chapter_2_Sanitation_and_wastewater_technologies_in_Harappa_Indus_valley_civilization_ca._26001900_BC|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=9 April 2015|ref=https://www.academia.edu/5937322/Chapter_2_Sanitation_and_wastewater_technologies_in_Harappa_Indus_valley_civilization_ca._26001900_BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya plumbing: First pressurized water feature found in New World|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155421.htm|publisher=Penn State|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The urban areas of the Indus Valley civilization included public and private baths. Sewage was disposed through underground drains built with precisely laid bricks, and a sophisticated water management system with numerous reservoirs was established. In the drainage systems, drains from houses were connected to wider public drains.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, J. C. and Ubertini, Lucio (2004). The Basis of Civilization - Water Science? pg 161. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (International Association of Hydrological Sciences Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of urban sanitation was seen in [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]], and the recently discovered [[Rakhigarhi]] of Indus Valley civilization. This urban plan included the world's first urban sanitation systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from [[Water well|wells]]. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets.

Devices such as [[shadoof]]s and [[sakia]]s were used to lift water to ground level. Ruins from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] like [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan and [[Dholavira]] in [[Gujarat]] in India had settlements with some of the ancient world's most sophisticated sewage systems. They included drainage channels, rainwater harvesting, and street ducts.

[[Stepwell]]s have mainly been used in the Indian subcontinent.

The earliest covered sewers uncovered by [[archaeologist]]s are in the regularly planned cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Wastewater reuse activities ===
Wastewater reuse is an ancient practice, which has been applied since the dawn of human history, and is connected to the development of sanitation provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/04/01/000009265_3961006165519/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|title=Reuse of wastewater in agriculture: A guide for planners|last2=Kalbermatten|first2=J. M.|last3=Bartone|first3=C. R.|last1=Khouri|first1=N|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reuse of untreated [[municipal wastewater]] has been practiced for many centuries with the objective of diverting [[human waste]] outside of urban settlements. Likewise, land application of domestic wastewater is an old and common practice, which has gone through different stages of development.   

Domestic wastewater was used for irrigation by prehistoric civilizations (e.g. [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Indus Valley|Indus valley]], and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]) since the Bronze Age (ca. 3200-1100 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Snyder|first2=Shane A.|date=9 September 2015|title=Wastewater Treatment and Reuse: Past, Present, and Future|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/7/9/4887/htm|journal=Water|language=en|volume=7|issue=9|pages=4887–4895|doi=10.3390/w7094887|last1=Angelakis|first1=Andreas N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, wastewater was used for [[Waste disposal|disposal]], [[irrigation]], and [[Fertilizer|fertilization]] purposes by Hellenic civilizations and later by Romans in areas surrounding cities (e.g. Athens and Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Paranychianaki|first2=N.

Some of the earliest evidence of water wells are located in China. The Neolithic Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text ''[[I Ching|The Book of Changes]]'', originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Kuhn |first=Oliver  |date=2004-06-30 |title=Ancient Chinese Drilling |url=https://csegrecorder.com/articles/view/ancient-chinese-drilling |journal=Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists |publisher= Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists |volume=29 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago.

===Ancient Europe===
==== Ancient Greece ====
The ancient Greek civilization of [[Crete]], known as the [[Minoan civilization]], was the [[first civilization]] to use underground clay pipes for sanitation and water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Plumbing - CRETE|url=http://www.theplumber.com/crete.html|work=theplumber.com|publisher=theplumber.com|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their capital, [[Knossos]], had a well-organized water system for bringing in clean water, taking out waste water and storm sewage canals for overflow when there was heavy rain. It was also one of the first uses of a [[flush toilet]], dating back to the 18th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fieldnotes|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes|work=themodernantiquarian.com|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minoan civilization]] had stone sewers that were periodically flushed with clean water.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In addition to sophisticated water and sewer systems they devised elaborate heating systems. The Ancient Greeks of [[Athens]] and [[Asia Minor]] also used an indoor plumbing system, used for pressurized showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Inventions Showers |url=http://www.inventions.org/culture/ancient/showers.html |work=inventions.org |publisher=inventions.org |accessdate=26 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509052435/http://www.inventions.org/culture/ancient/showers.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek inventor [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]] used pressurized piping for fire fighting purposes in the City of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Eric|title=Old World, High Tech|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/old-world-high-tech-141284744/?no-ist=|work=smithsonianmag.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mayans were the third earliest civilization to have employed a system of indoor plumbing using pressurized water&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155421.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

An inverted siphon system, along with glass covered clay pipes, was used for the first time in the palaces of Crete, Greece. It is still in working condition, after about 3000 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==== Ancient Rome ====
{{Further information|Sanitation in Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pont du Gard]], a [[Roman aqueduct]] in France.]]
In ancient Rome, the [[Cloaca Maxima]], considered a marvel of engineering,{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} disgorged into the [[Tiber]].

Public [[latrine]]s were built over the Cloaca Maxima.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/Plumbing_3.htm|title=The History of Toilets|publisher=Mary Bellis|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] had [[Sanitation in Ancient Rome|indoor plumbing]], meaning a system of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] and pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use. Rome and other nations used [[lead]] pipes; while commonly thought to be the cause of lead poisoning in the Roman Empire, the combination of running water which did not stay in contact with the pipe for long and the deposition of [[Fouling|precipitation scale]] actually mitigated the risk from lead pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |title=Lead Poisoning and Rome |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= |publisher= |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman towns and garrisons in the [[United Kingdom]] between 46 BC and 400 AD had complex sewer networks sometimes constructed out of hollowed-out [[elm]] logs, which were shaped so that they butted together with the down-stream pipe providing a socket for the upstream pipe.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Ancient Near East===
====Mesopotamia====
The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at [[Nippur]] and at [[Eshnunna]].&lt;ref name="FLUORIDATED WATER CONTROVERSY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Joseph|title=FLUORIDATED WATER CONTROVERSY|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdIoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=The+Babylonians+introduced+the+world+to+clay+sewer+pipes,+c4000+BCE,+with+the+earliest+examples+found+in+the+Temple+of+Bel+at+Nippur+and+at+Eshnunna,+Babylonia.#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Babylonians%20introduced%20the%20world%20to%20clay%20sewer%20pipes%2C%20c4000%20BCE%2C%20with%20the%20earliest%20examples%20found%20in%20the%20Temple%20of%20Bel%20at%20Nippur%20and%20at%20Eshnunna%2C%20Babylonia.&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 August 2017|isbn=9781365912870|date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay pipes were later used in the [[Hittites|Hittite]] city of [[Hattusa]]. They had easily detachable and replaceable segments, and allowed for cleaning.

==Middle and early modern age==

[[File:Wismarer Wasserkunst.jpg|thumb|right|Waterworks (''Wasserkunst'') and fountain from 1602 in [[Wismar]], Germany.]]
In medieval European cities, small natural waterways used for carrying off [[wastewater]] were eventually covered over and functioned as sewers. [[London]]'s [[River Fleet]] is such a system. Open drains, or gutters, for waste water run-off ran along the center of some streets. These were known as "kennels" (i.e., canals, channels), and in Paris were sometimes known as “split streets,” as the waste water running along the middle physically split the streets into two halves. The first closed sewer constructed in Paris was designed by Hugues Aubird in 1370 on Monmartre Street, and was 300 meters long. The original purpose of designing and constructing a closed sewer in Paris was less-so for waste management as much as it was to hold back the stench coming from the odorous waste water.&lt;ref name="George Commair 2009"&gt;George Commair, "The Waste Water Network: and underground view of Paris," in Great Rivers History: Proceedings and Invited Papers for the EWRI Congress and History Symposium, May 17–19, 2009, Kansas City, Missouri, ed. Jerry R. Roger, (Reston: American Society of Civil Engineers, 2009), 91-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dubrovnik]], then known as Ragusa (Latin name), Statute from 1272. set out the parameters for the construction of septic tanks and channels for the removal of dirty water. Throughout 14. and 15. century sewage system was completed, and it is still operational today, with minor changes and repairs done in recent centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Sewerage of the City of Dubrovnik, Ivica Žile ; Ministarstvo kulture Uprava za zaštitu kulturne baštine Konzervatorski odjel u Dubrovniku, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pail closet]]s, [[outhouse]]s, and [[cesspit]]s were used to collect human waste. The use of human waste as [[fertilizer]] was especially important in China and Japan, where cattle manure was less available. However, most cities did not have a functioning sewer system before the [[Industrial era]], relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional [[rain]] showers to wash away the sewage from the streets. In some places, [[waste water]] simply ran down the streets, which had [[Step-stone bridge|stepping stones]] to keep pedestrians out of the muck, and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.

In the 16th century, [[John Harington (writer)|Sir John Harington]] invented a flush toilet as a device for [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (his godmother) that released wastes into [[cesspool]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After the adoption of [[gunpowder]], municipal outhouses became an important source of raw material for the making of [[saltpeter]] in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Firearms: A Global History to 1700, Kenneth Chase&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, the contents of the city's outhouses were collected every night by commissioned wagons and delivered to the nitrite beds where it was laid into specially designed soil beds to produce earth rich in mineral nitrates. The nitrate rich-earth would be then further processed to produce saltpeter, or [[potassium nitrate]], an important ingredient in [[black powder]] that played a part in the making of gunpower.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions for the Manufacture of Saltpetre, Joseph LeConte, 1823-1901&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic and Early Modern Mesoamerica===
The [[Classic Maya]] at [[Palenque]] had underground aqueducts and [[flush toilet]]s; the Classic Maya even used household water filters using locally abundant limestone carved into a porous cylinder, made so as to work in a manner strikingly similar to Modern [[ceramic water filter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental and Water Resources Milestones in Engineering History|date=March 15–19, 2007|publisher=ASCE Publications|location=Tampa, Florida, USA|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tS1Zb_5KKsC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=palenque+aqueduct+water+engineering|isbn=9780784471968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penn State"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya plumbing: First pressurized water feature found in New World|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155421.htm|work=Science Daily|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sewage farms for disposal and irrigation=== 

“[[Sewage farm|Sewage farms]]” (i.e. wastewater application to the land for disposal and agricultural use) were operated in Bunzlau (Silesia) in 1531, in Edinburgh (Scotland) in 1650, in Paris (France) in 1868, in Berlin (Germany) in 1876 and in different parts of the USA since 1871, where wastewater was used for beneficial crop production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/17/000178830_98101911161131/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|title=Wastewater Irrigation in Developing Countries: Health Effects and Technical Solutions|last2=Adin|first2=A|last3=Fattal|first3=B|last1=Shuval|first1=H.I|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/books/9781780404844/evolution-sanitation-and-wastewater-technologies-through-centuries|title=Evolution of sanitation and wastewater technologies through the centuries|last=|first=|date=2014|publisher=IWA (International Water Association)|isbn=9781780404844|location=[S.l.]|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries (16th and 18th centuries) in many rapidly growing countries/cities of Europe (e.g. Germany, France) and the United States, “sewage farms” were increasingly seen as a solution for the disposal of large volumes of the wastewater, some of which are still in operation today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bahri|first2=A|last3=Brissaud|first3=F|last4=Angelakis|first4=A.

=== Sewer systems===
{{further information|Combined_sewer#History}}
[[File:BrisbaneSuburbanOuthouses1950.jpg|thumb|Many industrialized cities had incomplete public sanitation well into the 20th century. Outhouses in [[Brisbane]], Australia, around 1950.]]
A significant development was the construction of a network of sewers to collect wastewater. In some cities, including [[Rome]], [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]) and [[Fustat]], networked ancient sewer systems continue to function today as collection systems for those cities' modernized sewer systems. Instead of flowing to a river or the sea, the pipes have been re-routed to modern sewer treatment facilities.

However, until the [[Enlightenment era]], little progress was made in water supply and sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected throughout Europe. This began to change in the 17th and 18th centuries with a rapid expansion in waterworks and [[pumping station|pumping systems]].

The tremendous [[Urbanization|growth of cities]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]] quickly led to terribly [[Pollution|overpolluted]] streets, which acted as a constant source for the outbreak of disease.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|pp=4-8}}

People wealthy enough to enjoy 19th century flush [[toilet]]s often had the political power to allow them to drain into public sewers; and the practice became the norm as indoor plumbing became more common, based on large-scale supply networks such as the [[Croton Aqueduct]] in New York.

As cities grew in the 19th century, increasing concerns were raised about [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Burian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burian|first=Steven J.|last2=Nix|first2=Stephan J.|last3=Pitt|first3=Robert E.|last4=Durrans|first4=S.

Initially these systems discharged sewage directly to [[surface water]]s without treatment.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=12}} Later, cities attempted to treat the sewage before discharge in order to prevent [[water pollution]] and [[waterborne diseases]]. During the half-century around 1900, these [[public health]] interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of [[life expectancy]] experienced at the time.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cutler |first=David M. |first2=Grant |last2=Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The 20th Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early techniques involved land application of sewage on agricultural land.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=12}} The use of the land treatment systems continued into the nineteenth/twentieth century in central Europe, USA, and other locations all over the world, but not without causing serious public health concerns and negative environmental impacts. During the 1840s and 1850s, this practice resulted in disastrous spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wastewater reclamation and reuse, Water Quality Management Library|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9vAGkleP234C&amp;pg=PR29 |via=[[Google Books]] |last1=Asano|first1=T|accessdate=29 July 2016|isbn=9781566766203|date=1998-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the water supply links with these diseases became clear, engineering solutions were implemented that include the development of alternative water sources using reservoirs and aqueduct systems, relocation of water intakes, and water and wastewater treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/sample%20chapters/c07/e2-14-01.pdf|title=RECYCLE AND REUSE OF DOMESTIC WASTEWATER|last2=Sundaravadivel|first2=M|last1=Vigneswaran|first1=S|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century some cities began to add chemical treatment and [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|sedimentation]] systems to their sewers.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|28}} Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for [[sewage treatment]] in the 20th century, after scientists at the [[University of Manchester]] discovered the sewage treatment process of [[activated sludge]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Benidickson, Jamie 2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_v0WjdM6sLoC|title=The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011|author=Benidickson, Jamie|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9780774841382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[storm drain|Storm]] and [[sanitary sewer]]s were necessarily developed along with the growth of cities. By the 1840s the luxury of [[indoor plumbing]], which mixes human waste with water and flushes it away, eliminated the need for [[cesspool]]s.  The odor was considered the big problem in waste disposal and to address it, sewage could be drained to a [[aerated lagoon|lagoon]], or "settled" and the solids removed, to be disposed of separately.  This process is now called "primary treatment" and the settled solids are called "sludge."

==== London and other cities, UK ====
As recently as the late 19th-century sewerage systems in some parts of the rapidly industrializing [[United Kingdom]] were so inadequate that [[water-borne disease]]s such as [[cholera]] and [[typhoid]] remained a risk.

From as early as 1535 there were efforts to stop polluting the [[River Thames]] in [[London]]. Beginning with an Act passed that year that was to prohibit the dumping of excrement into the river. Leading up to the Industrial Revolution the River Thames was identified as being thick and black due to sewage, and it was even said that the river “smells like death.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Filthy River" in Thames: Sacred River|date=2007|publisher=Nan A. Talese/Doubleday|location=New York|pages=270–275|last1=Ackroyd|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Britain was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to experience the disastrous consequences of major [[urbanisation]] and was the first to construct a modern sewerage system to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} During the early 19th century, the River Thames was effectively an open sewer, leading to frequent outbreaks of [[cholera]] epidemics. Proposals to modernize the sewerage system had been made during 1856 but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the ''[[Great Stink]]'' of 1858, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] realized the urgency of the problem and resolved to create a modern sewerage system.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=9}}

[[Joseph Bazalgette]], a [[civil engineer]] and Chief Engineer of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], was given responsibility for the work. He designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the [[Thames Estuary]], downstream of the main center of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totaling almost 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) in length, were constructed, some incorporating stretches of [[Subterranean rivers of London|London's 'lost' rivers]]. Three of these sewers were north of the river, the southernmost, low-level one being incorporated in the [[Thames Embankment]]. The Embankment also allowed new roads, new public gardens, and the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle Line]] of the [[London Underground]].

The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720&amp;nbsp;km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000&amp;nbsp;km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, 2.7 million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Cities and Technology|last=Goodman|first=David C.|last2=Chant|first2=Colin|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415200790|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gravity]] allowed the sewage to flow eastwards, but in places such as [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Deptford]] and [[Abbey Mills Pumping Station|Abbey Mills]], pumping stations were built to raise the water and provide sufficient flow. Sewers north of the Thames feed into the [[Northern Outfall Sewer]], which fed into a major treatment works at [[Beckton]]. South of the river, the [[Southern Outfall Sewer]] extended to a similar facility at [[Crossness Pumping Station|Crossness]]. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gBwjLTUzEMC|title=100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2006|pages=148–149|author=Kendall F. Haven|isbn=9781591582649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Merthyr Tydfil]], a large town in [[South Wales]], most houses discharged their sewage to individual [[cess-pit]]s which persistently overflowed causing the pavements to be awash with foul sewage.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Principal Officer of Health, Glamorgan County Council, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paris, France ====
{{Main article|Paris_sewers#History}}
In 1802 [[Napoleon]] built the [[Ourcq canal]] which brought 70,000 cubic meters of water a day to Paris, while the [[Seine]] river received up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and wastewater in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and wastewater management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometers of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents to pack up and move elsewhere.&lt;ref name="George Commair 2009"/&gt;

The 19th century brick-vaulted [[Paris sewers]] serve as a tourist attraction nowadays.

In 1863, work began on the construction of a modern sewerage system for the rapidly growing city of [[Frankfurt am Main]], based on design work by  [[William Lindley]]. 20 years after the system's completion, the [[death rate]] from [[typhoid]] had fallen from 80 to 10 per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burian2" /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Lindley, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memphis sewers 1880.jpg|thumb|Map of the sewer system of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1880]]
==== USA ====
The first sewer systems in the United States were built in the late 1850s in [[Chicago]] and [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Burian2" /&gt;{{rp|43}}

In the United States, the first sewage treatment plant using [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] was built in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

=== Sewage treatment plants ===
At the end of the 19th century, since primary treatment still left odor problems, it was discovered that bad odors could be prevented by introducing oxygen into the decomposing sewage. This was the beginning of the biological aerobic and anaerobic treatments which are fundamental to wastewater processes.

As [[Water pollution|pollution]] of water bodies became a concern, cities attempted to treat the sewage before discharge.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=12-13}} In the late 19th century some cities began to add chemical treatment and [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|sedimentation]] systems to their sewers.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|28}} In the United States, the first sewage treatment plant using [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] was built in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for [[sewage treatment]] in the early 20th century, after scientists at the [[University of Manchester]] discovered the sewage treatment process of [[activated sludge]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Benidickson, Jamie 2011" /&gt; During the half-century around 1900, these [[public health]] interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of [[life expectancy]] experienced at the time.&lt;ref name="nber.org" /&gt;

=== Toilets ===
{{Further information|Toilet#History}}
With the onset of the industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the [[flush toilet]] began to emerge into its modern form. It needs to be connected to a [[Sanitary sewer|sewer system]] though. Where this is not feasible or desired, [[dry toilet]]s are an alternative option.

===Water supply===
[[File:Chelsea Waterworks 1752.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Chelsea Waterworks Company|Chelsea Waterworks]], 1752. Two Newcomen beam engines pumped Thames water from a canal to reservoirs at [[Green Park]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].]]
An ambitious engineering project to bring fresh water from [[Hertfordshire]] to [[London]] was undertaken by [[Hugh Myddleton]], who oversaw the construction of the [[New River (England)|New River]] between 1609 and 1613. The [[New River Company]] became one of the largest private water companies of the time, supplying the [[City of London]] and other central areas.&lt;ref name="waterhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/london/ |title=Water-related Infrastructure in Medieval London |publisher=waterhistory.org |accessdate=2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in [[London water supply infrastructure|London]]. The [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] was established in 1723 "for the better supplying the [[City of Westminster|City]] and [[Liberty of Westminster|Liberties]] of [[Westminster]] and parts adjacent with water".&lt;ref name="London Encyclopaedia"&gt;''The London Encyclopaedia'', Ben Weinreb &amp; Christopher Hibbert, Macmillan, 1995, {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page44.asp Royal Charters, Privy Council website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824225331/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page44.asp |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company created extensive ponds in the area bordering [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Pimlico]] using water from the [[Tideway|tidal Thames]]. Other waterworks were established in London, including at [[West Ham]] in 1743, at [[Lea Bridge]] before 1767, [[Lambeth Waterworks Company]] in 1785, [[West Middlesex Waterworks Company]] in 1806&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/westmiddlesex_waterworks_a2.html UCLA Department of Epidemiology ''West Middlesex Waterworks history'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grand Junction Waterworks Company]] in 1811.&lt;ref name="ph.ucla.edu"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/lambeth_waterworks_a2.html UCLA Department of Epidemiology ''Lambeth Waterwork history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[trap (plumbing)|S-bend]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] was invented by [[Alexander Cummings]] in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by [[Thomas Crapper]] in 1880. The first screw-down [[Tap (valve)|water tap]] was patented in 1845 by Guest and Chrimes, a brass foundry in [[Rotherham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plumber.whangarei.biz/a-little-about-tap-history/|title=A Little About Tap History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water treatment===
Founders of [[microscopy]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and [[Robert Hooke]], used the newly invented [[microscope]] to observe for the first time small material particles that were suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens and [[waterborne diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwaterfilters.com/microscope-in-water.html|title=The Use of the Microscope in Water Filter History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sand filter====
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
Sir [[Francis Bacon]] attempted to [[desalination|desalinate]] sea water by passing the flow through a [[sand filter]]. Although his experiment didn't succeed, it marked the beginning of a new interest in the field.

The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. (2003). Crowded with genius: the Scottish enlightenment: Edinburgh's moment of the mind. New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html History of the Chelsea Waterworks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Keith. (1998). The history of chlorine. Waterworld, 14 (8), 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S. William Gunn, M. Masellis] {{ISBN|0-387-72263-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+snow&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=0Kd7TLfkGMSOOIrs2a4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA]&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]]. Automatic pressure filters, where the water is forced under pressure through the filtration system, were innovated in 1899 in England.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

====Water chlorination====
In what may have been one of the first attempts to use chlorine, William Soper used chlorinated lime to treat the sewage produced by [[typhoid]] patients in 1879.

In a paper published in 1894, [[Moritz Traube]] formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) to water to render it "germ-free."  Two other investigators confirmed Traube’s findings and published their papers in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Turneaure, F.E. |author2=H.L. Russell | year = 1901 | title = Public Water-Supplies:  Requirements, Resources, and the Construction of Works | edition = 1st | location = New York | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | page = 493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] and in 1897 the city of [[Maidstone]] [[England]] was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In the Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London:Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manual Control Chlorinator.jpg|300px|thumb|Manual Control Chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From ''Chlorination of Water'' by Joseph Race, 1918.]]
The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100-9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.  The treatment process was conceived by Dr. John L. Leal and the chlorination plant was designed by [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1909). "Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir." ''Proceedings'' AWWA. pp. 110-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Allen. (1916). ''Clean Water and How to Get It.'' New York:Wiley. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account, "It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= V. B. Nesfield|title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting its Potability|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract|journal=Public Health|year=1902|pages=601–3|doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Army]] [[Major]] [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. Shortly thereafter, Major William J. L. Lyster of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''.

====Fluoridation====
{{Further information|History of water fluoridation}}
[[Water fluoridation]] is a practice that has been carried out since the early 20th century for the purpose of decreasing [[tooth decay]].

==Today (21st century and beyond)==

Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including [[rainwater harvesting]] and [[stormwater harvesting]] where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as "Fit for Purpose".

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] formulated in 2015 include targets on access to water supply and sanitation at a global level.

During the beginning of the 21st century, especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure has not been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand. One option is the use of [[desalination]] technology; this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in "dry" countries like [[List of desalination plants in Australia|Australia]].

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'. See Nicolas Walter,  ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanism is Eight Letters, No More|url=http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more|authors=Harold Blackham, Levi Fragell, Corliss Lamont, Harry Stopes-Roe,  Rob Tielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459), an early Renaissance humanist, book collector, and reformer of script, who served as papal secretary&lt;ref&gt;Following an old engraving; from Alfred Gudeman, ''Imagines philologorum: 160 bildnisse...'' ("Portraits of Philologists, 160 prints"), (Leipzig/Berlin) 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to "''vivre pour altrui''" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and [[Matthew Arnold]] to [[Thomas Hardy]].

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership, and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Morain |first1=Lloyd |last2=Morain |first2=Mary |title=Humanism as the Next Step |publisher=Humanist Press |year=2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |url=http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/63/226/Hum_as_the_Next_Step.pdf |isbn=978-0931779091 |lccn=97-74611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

====Renaissance humanists====
{{main|Renaissance humanism}}

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two.

&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1525">'''Hylogenesis''' is a [[Physics|physical]] [[Scientific theory|theory]] about the mechanism behind the origins of [[dark matter]] and [[antimatter]]. It was proposed in August 2010 in a paper by Hooman Davoudiasl, David E. Morrissey, [[Kris Sigurdson]] and Sean Tulin.&lt;ref name=first&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2399&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory involves a [[fermion]] X, and its antiparticle {{overline|X}}, both of which may couple into [[quark]]s in the visible sector, and into hidden particles in a hidden sector, a sector which is not part of the [[Standard Model]]. The hidden states have masses near a GeV and very weak couplings to particles in the Standard Model. X and {{overline|X}} respectively decay into either [[Baryon|baryonic]] matter or hidden baryonic matter, and into either antibaryonic matter or hidden antibaryonic matter, violating [[CP-violation|CP]] and quark [[baryon number]].&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

An excess of baryonic matter is created in the visible sector, and an excess of antimatter is created in the hidden sector. The hidden antimatter is explained as being stable dark matter. The X and {{overline|X}} particles have a conserved baryon number charge, so equal and opposite charges appear in the visible and hidden sectors. Therefore, the Universe's total baryon charge stays zero.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|right|The common fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', has been used extensively for research.]]

'''Invertebrates''' are [[animal]]s that neither possess nor develop a [[vertebral column]] (commonly known as a ''backbone'' or ''spine''), derived from the [[notochord]]. This includes all [[animal]]s apart from the [[subphylum]] [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]]. Familiar examples of invertebrates include [[insect]]s; [[Crustacean|crabs, lobsters and their kin]]; [[Mollusca|snails, clams, octopuses and their kin]]; [[Echinoderm|starfish, sea-urchins and their kin]]; [[jellyfish]], and [[worm]]s.

The majority of animal species are invertebrates; one estimate puts the figure at 97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert M.|last=May|date=16 September 1988|title=How Many Species Are There on Earth?|journal=Science|volume=241|issue=4872|pages=1441–1449|url=http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-253/002-253.html|jstor=1702670|pmid=17790039|doi=10.1126/science.241.4872.1441|bibcode=1988Sci...241.1441M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many invertebrate [[taxon|taxa]] have a greater number and variety of species than the entire subphylum of Vertebrata.&lt;ref name="isbn0-412-61390-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richards, O. W. |author2=Davies, R.G. |title=Imms' General Textbook of Entomology: Volume 1: Structure, Physiology and Development Volume 2: Classification and Biology |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-412-61390-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the so-called invertebrates, such as the [[Tunicate|Tunicata]] and [[Lancelet|Cephalochordata]] are more closely related to the vertebrates than to other invertebrates.  This makes the invertebrates [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], so the term has little meaning in [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

==Etymology==
The word "invertebrate" comes from the Latin word ''vertebra'', which means a joint in general, and sometimes specifically a joint from the spinal column of a vertebrate. The jointed aspect of ''vertebra'' is derived from the concept of turning, expressed in the root ''verto'' or ''vorto'', to turn.&lt;ref name= "Latin Tucker"&gt;{{cite book | author= Tucker, T. G.| title = A Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin | publisher = Max Niemeyer Verlag | location = Halle (Saale)| year = 1931 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prefix ''in-'' means "not" or "without".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first=Walter William|title=An etymological dictionary of the English language|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomic significance==
The term ''invertebrates'' is not always precise among non-biologists since it does not accurately describe a [[taxon]] in the same way that [[Arthropod]]a, [[Vertebrata]] or [[Manidae]] do. Each of these terms describes a valid taxon,  [[phylum]], [[subphylum]] or [[Family (biology)|family]]. "Invertebrata" is a term of convenience, not a taxon; it has very little [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscriptional]] significance except within the [[Chordate|Chordata]]. The Vertebrata as a [[Taxonomic rank|subphylum]] comprises such a small proportion of the [[Animal|Metazoa]] that to speak of the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animal]]ia in terms of "Vertebrata" and "Invertebrata" has limited practicality. In the more formal taxonomy of Animalia other attributes that logically should precede the presence or absence of the vertebral column in constructing a [[cladogram]], for example, the presence of a [[notochord]]. That would at least circumscribe the Chordata. However, even the notochord would be a less fundamental criterion than aspects of embryological development and symmetry&lt;ref name=" Pech"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pechenik | first = Jan | title = Biology of the Invertebrates | publisher = Wm. C. Brown Publishers | location = Dubuque | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-697-13712-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps [[Body plan|bauplan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Brusca, Richard C.  |author2=Brusca, Gary J. | title = Invertebrates | publisher = Sinauer Associates | location = Sunderland | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-87893-098-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the concept of ''invertebrates'' as a taxon of animals has persisted for over a century among the [[laity]],&lt;ref name= "isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within the zoological community and in its literature it remains in use as a term of convenience for animals that are not members of the Vertebrata.&lt;ref name="Agassiz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Agassiz|title=Essay on Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6fDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT115|date=21 March 2013|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-15135-9|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following text reflects earlier scientific understanding of the term and of those animals which have constituted it. According to this understanding, invertebrates do not possess a skeleton of bone, either internal or external. They include hugely varied [[body plan]]s. Many have fluid-filled, hydrostatic skeletons, like [[jellyfish]] or worms. Others have hard [[exoskeleton]]s, outer shells like those of [[insect]]s and [[crustacean]]s. The most familiar invertebrates include the [[Protozoa]], [[Porifera]], [[Coelenterata]], [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nematoda]], [[Annelida]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Mollusca]] and [[Arthropoda]]. Arthropoda include [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[arachnid]]s.

==Number of extant species==

The [[IUCN]] estimates that 66,178 [[Vertebrate#Number of extant species|extant vertebrate species]] have been described,&lt;ref name=IUCN1014 /&gt; which means that over 95% of the described animal species in the world are invertebrates.

==Characteristics==
The trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a [[vertebral column]] (backbone): this creates a distinction between invertebrates and vertebrates. The distinction is one of convenience only; it is not based on any clear biologically [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] trait, any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and birds, or than not having wings unites [[tortoise]]s, [[snail]]s and [[sponge]]s. Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions, such as the [[Porifera]], invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior.

=== Morphology and symmetry ===
The [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit some form of [[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]], whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A minority, however, exhibit no symmetry. One example of asymmetric invertebrates includes all [[gastropod]] species. This is easily seen in [[snail]]s and [[sea snail]]s, which have helical shells. [[Slug]]s appear externally symmetrical, but their [[pneumostome]] (breathing hole) is located on the right side. Other gastropods develop external asymmetry, such as [[Glaucus atlanticus]] that develops asymmetrical [[cerata]] as they mature. The origin of gastropod asymmetry is a subject of scientific debate.&lt;ref name="gastropod development"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Louise R. Page| title=Modern insights on gastropod development: Reevaluation of the evolution of a novel body plan| journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology| year=2006| volume=46| issue=2| url=http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/2/134| pages=134–143| doi=10.1093/icb/icj018| pmid=21672730| accessdate=8 February 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412204751/http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/2/134| archivedate=12 April 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of asymmetry are found in [[fiddler crab]]s and [[hermit crab]]s. They often have one claw much larger than the other. If a male fiddler loses its large claw, it will grow another on the opposite side after [[moulting]]. [[Sessility (zoology)|Sessile]] animals such as [[sponge]]s are asymmetrical&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0847482.html Symmetry, biological], cited at FactMonster.com from ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[coral]] [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] (with the exception of the individual [[polyp]]s that exhibit radial symmetry); [[alpheidae]] claws that lack pincers; and some [[copepod]]s, [[polyopisthocotylea]]ns, and [[monogenea]]ns which parasitize by attachment or residency within the [[gill]] chamber of their [[fish]] [[host (biology)|hosts]]).

====Nervous system====
[[Neurons]] differ in invertebrates from mammalian cells. Invertebrates cells fire in response to similar stimuli as mammals, such as tissue trauma, high temperature, or changes in pH. The first invertebrate in which a neuron cell was identified was the medicinal [[leech]], ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]].''&lt;ref name="Nicholls and Baylor, 1968"&gt;Nicholls, J.G. and Baylor, D.A., (1968).

Properties of the nociceptive neurons of the leech segmental ganglion. Journal of Neurophysiology, 75: 2268–2279&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning and memory using nociceptors in the sea hare, ''[[Aplysia]]'' has been described.&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 1978"&gt;Byrne, J.H., Castellucci, V.F. and Kandel, E.R., (1978).

Mechanosensory neurons innervating Aplysia siphon encode noxious stimuli and display nociceptive sensitization. The Journal of Neuroscience, 17: 459-469&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons have been identified in a wide range of invertebrate species, including annelids, molluscs, [[nematode]]s and arthropods.&lt;ref name="Eismann et al., 1984"&gt;Eisemann, C.H., Jorgensen, W.K., Merritt, D.J., Rice, M.J., Cribb, B.W., Webb, P.D. and Zalucki, M.P., (1984).

====Respiratory system====
[[File:Tracheal system of dissected cockroach.tif|thumb|Tracheal system of dissected [[cockroach]].  The largest tracheae run across the width of the body of the cockroach and are horizontal in this image. Scale bar, 2 mm.]]
[[File:Cockroach tracheae supplying crop.tiff|thumb|The tracheal system branches into progressively smaller tubes, here supplying the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]] of the cockroach.  Scale bar, 2.0 mm.]]
One type of invertebrate respiriatory system is the open [[respiratory system]] composed of [[spiracle]]s, tracheae, and [[tracheole]]s that [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] arthropods have to transport [[metabolism|metabolic]] gases to and from tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserthal, Lutz T. (1998). Chapter 25: The Open Hemolymph System of Holometabola and Its Relation to the Tracheal Space. In "Microscopic Anatomy of Invertebrates". Wiley-Liss, Inc. {{ISBN|0-471-15955-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The distribution of spiracles can vary greatly among the many [[order (biology)|orders]] of insects, but in general each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. The tracheae are invaginations of the cuticular [[exoskeleton]] that branch ([[anastomosis|anastomose]]) throughout the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm. The smallest tubes, tracheoles, penetrate cells and serve as sites of [[diffusion]] for [[water]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon dioxide]]. Gas may be conducted through the respiratory system by  means of active [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] or passive diffusion. Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their [[hemolymph|haemolymph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Westneat, Mark W. |author2=Betz, Oliver |author3=Blob, Richard W. |author4=Fezzaa, Kamel |author5=Cooper, James W. |author6=Lee, Wah-Keat | title=Tracheal Respiration in Insects Visualized with Synchrotron X-ray Imaging | journal=Science |date=January 2003 | volume=299 | pages=558–560 | doi=10.1126/science.1078008 | pmid=12543973 | issue=5606|bibcode=2003Sci...299..558W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of [[taenidia]] in various [[geometry|geometries]] such as loops or [[helix|helices]]. In the [[head]], [[thorax]], or [[abdomen]], tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as [[grasshopper]]s and [[bee]]s, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a [[gill]], or function essentially as normal, via a [[Gill#Plastron|plastron]]. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are shed during moulting ([[ecdysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewer|first=John|date=2005-10-11|title=How the Ecdysozoan Changed Its Coat|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030349|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e349|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030349|issn=1545-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Like vertebrates, most invertebrates reproduce at least partly through [[sexual reproduction]]. They produce specialized [[Gametogonium|reproductive cells]] that undergo [[meiosis]] to produce smaller, motile [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] or larger, non-motile [[ovum|ova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Jill|title=Master the GED 2011 (w/CD)|year=2010|publisher=Peterson's|isbn=978-0-7689-2885-3|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fuse to form [[zygote]]s, which develop into new individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Matthew B.|title=Population genetics|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3277-0|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are capable of asexual reproduction, or sometimes, both methods of reproduction.

===Social interaction===
Social behavior is widespread in invertebrates, including cockroaches, termites, aphids, [[thrips]], ants, bees, [[Passalidae]], [[Acari]], spiders, and more.&lt;ref name=ChoeCrespi1997&gt;{{cite book|editor1-link=Jae C.

Crespi|title=The Evolution of Social Behavior in Insects and Arachnids|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521589772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social interaction is particularly salient in [[eusocial]] species but applies to other invertebrates as well.

Insects recognize information transmitted by other insects.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature03526| pmid = 15889092| year = 2005| last1 = Riley | first1 = J.| last2 = Greggers | first2 = U.| last3 = Smith | first3 = A.| last4 = Reynolds | first4 = D.| last5 = Menzel | first5 = R.| title = The flight paths of honeybees recruited by the waggle dance| volume = 435| issue = 7039| pages = 205–207| journal = Nature |bibcode = 2005Natur.435..205R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley T.D. |author2=Visscher P.K. |author3=Passino K.M. | year = 2006 | title = Group decision making in honey bee swarms | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 94 | issue = 3| pages = 220–229 | doi=10.1511/2006.3.220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frisch1967"&gt;Frisch, Karl von.

=== Phyla ===
[[File:Cladocora.jpg|right|thumb|The fossil coral ''Cladocora'' from the [[Pliocene]] of [[Cyprus]]]]

The term invertebrates covers several phyla. One of these are the sponges ([[Porifera]]). They were long thought to have diverged from other animals early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Porifera|year=2003|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.

As such, they are sometimes called [[diploblastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kotpal|first=R. L.|title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Invertebrates|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-81-7133-903-7|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Echinodermata]] are radially symmetric and exclusively marine, including [[starfish]] (Asteroidea), [[sea urchin]]s, (Echinoidea), [[brittle star]]s (Ophiuroidea), [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]] (Holothuroidea) and [[Crinoid|feather stars]] (Crinoidea).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcamo|first=Edward|title=Biology Coloring Workbook|year=1998|publisher=The Princeton Review|isbn=978-0-679-77884-4|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest animal phylum is also included within invertebrates: the Arthropoda, including insects, [[spider]]s, [[crab]]s, and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. In addition, they possess a hardened exoskeleton that is periodically shed during growth.&lt;ref name=forensic&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|page=214|title=Essential forensic biology|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-75804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two smaller phyla, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.

These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom. Other invertebrates include the [[Nemertea]] or ribbon worms, and the [[Sipuncula]].

Another phylum is [[Platyhelminthes]], the flatworms.&lt;ref name=Gilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilson|first=Étienne|title=El espíritu de la filosofía medieval|year=2004|publisher=Ediciones Rialp|isbn=978-84-321-3492-0|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were originally considered primitive, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruiz-Trillo|first1=Iñaki |last2=Riutort|first2=Marta |last3=Littlewood|first3=D.

Among lesser phyla of invertebrates are the [[Hemichordata]], or acorn worms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asking about life|year=2005|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-40653-0|author=Tobin, Allan J.|author2=Jennie Dusheck|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chaetognatha, or arrow worms. Other phyla include [[Acoelomorpha]], [[Brachiopoda]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Entoprocta]], [[Phoronida]], and [[Xenoturbellida]].

==Classification of invertebrates==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}

Invertebrates can be classified into several main categories, some of which are [[Biological classification|taxonomically]] obsolescent or debatable, but still used as terms of convenience. Each however appears in its own article at the following links.

*''[[Protozoa]]'' (like the worms, an arbitrary grouping of convenience)
*[[Sponge]]s (''Porifera'')
*[[Cnidaria|Stinging jellyfish and corals]] (''Cnidaria'')
*[[Ctenophora|Comb jellies]] (''Ctenophora'')
*[[Flatworm]]s (''Platyhelminthes'')
*[[Aschelminth|Round- or threadworms]] (''Nematoda'')
*[[Annelid|segmented worms]] (''Annelida'')
*[[Arthropod|Insects, spiders, crabs and their kin]] (''Arthropoda'')
*[[Mollusca|Cuttlefish, snails, mussels and their kin]] (''Mollusca'')
*[[Echinoderm|Starfish, sea-cucumbers and their kin]] (''Echinodermata'')

== History ==
The earliest animal fossils appear to be those of invertebrates. 665-million-year-old fossils in the Trezona Formation at Trezona Bore, West Central Flinders, South Australia have been interpreted as being early sponges.&lt;ref name="roseMaloof"&gt;{{cite journal | author1= Maloof, Adam C. |author2= Rose, Catherine V. |author3= Beach, Robert |author4= Samuels, Bradley M. |author5= Calmet, Claire C. |author6= Erwin, Douglas H. |author7= Poirier, Gerald R. |author8= Yao, Nan |author9= Simons, Frederik J.|title= Possible animal-body fossils in pre-Marinoan limestones from South Australia |journal= Nature Geoscience | volume= 3 | pages= 653 |date= 17 August 2010 |url= http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo934.html |doi=10.1038/ngeo934 | issue= 9 | bibcode=2010NatGe...3..653M  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some paleontologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology|year=2005|publisher=Pearson, Benjamin Cummings|isbn=978-0-8053-7171-0|author=Campbell.

Around 453 MYA, animals began diversifying, and many of the important groups of invertebrates diverged from one another. Fossils of invertebrates are found in various types of sediment from the [[Phanerozoic]].&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarkson|first=Euan Neilson Kerr|title=Invertebrate palaeontology and evolution|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-632-05238-7|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils of invertebrates are commonly used in stratigraphy.&lt;ref name=Kummel&gt;{{cite book|last=Kummel|first=Bernhard|title=Status of invertebrate paleontology, 1953|page=93|isbn=978-0-405-12715-1|year=1954|publisher=Ayer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
[[Carl Linnaeus]] divided these animals into only two groups, the Insecta and the now-obsolete [[Vermes]] ([[worm]]s). [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was appointed to the position of "Curator of Insecta and Vermes" at the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in 1793, both coined the term "invertebrate" to describe such animals, and divided the original two groups into ten, by splitting Arachnida and Crustacea from the Linnean Insecta, and Mollusca, Annelida, [[Barnacle|Cirripedia]], [[Radiata]], [[Coelenterata]] and [[Infusoria]] from the Linnean Vermes. They are now classified into over 30 [[phylum|phyla]], from simple organisms such as [[sea sponge]]s and [[flatworm]]s to complex animals such as arthropods and molluscs.

==== Significance of the group ====
Invertebrates are animals  ''without'' a vertebral column. This has led to the conclusion that ''in''vertebrates are a group that deviates from the normal, vertebrates. This has been said to be because researchers in the past, such as Lamarck, viewed vertebrates as a "standard": in Lamarck's theory of evolution, he believed that characteristics acquired through the evolutionary process involved not only survival, but also progression toward a "higher form", to which humans and vertebrates were closer than invertebrates were. Although goal-directed evolution has been abandoned, the distinction of invertebrates and vertebrates persists to this day, even though the grouping has been noted to be "hardly natural or even very sharp." Another reason cited for this continued distinction is that Lamarck created a precedent through his classifications which is now difficult to escape from. It is also possible that some humans believe that, they themselves being vertebrates, the group deserves more attention than invertebrates.&lt;ref name=rskbarnes&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Richard Stephen Kent|title=The Invertebrates: A Synthesis|isbn=978-0-632-04761-1|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2001|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, in the 1968 edition of ''Invertebrate Zoology'', it is noted that "division of the Animal Kingdom into vertebrates and invertebrates is artificial and reflects human bias in favor of man's own relatives." The book also points out that the group lumps a vast number of species together, so that no one characteristic describes all invertebrates. In addition, some species included are only remotely related to one another, with some more related to vertebrates than other invertebrates (see [[Paraphyly]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barnes |first=Robert D.|year=1968|title=Invertebrate Zoology|edition=2nd|publisher=W.B. Saunders|oclc=173898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In research==
For many centuries, invertebrates were neglected by biologists, in favor of big vertebrates and "useful" or [[charismatic species]].&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; Invertebrate biology was not a major field of study until the work of [[Linnaeus]] and [[Lamarck]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nmnh.typepad.com/no_bones/2015/06/why-study-invertebrates-a-philosophical-argument-from-aristotle.html |title=Why study invertebrates? A philosophical argument from Aristotle |last1=Ducarme |first1=Frédéric |date=2015 |website=No Bones (Smithsonian Institution website) |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, invertebrate zoology became one of the major fields of natural sciences, with prominent discoveries in the fields of medicine, genetics, palaeontology, and ecology.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; The study of invertebrates has also benefited law enforcement, as arthropods, and especially insects, were discovered to be a source of information for forensic investigators.&lt;ref name=forensic /&gt;

Two of the most commonly studied model organisms nowadays are invertebrates: the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''. They have long been the most intensively studied [[model organism]]s, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their [[genome]]s, but many [[gene]]s, [[intron]]s, and [[genetic linkage|linkages]] have been lost. Analysis of the [[starlet sea anemone]] genome has emphasised the importance of sponges, placozoans, and [[choanoflagellate]]s, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to animals.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Irving Bieber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|b|ər}}; 1909–1991) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], best known for his study ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'' (1962), in which Bieber took the since discredited position that [[homosexuality]] is an illness.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"/&gt; 

==Life and career==
Irving Bieber was born in [[New York City]] and graduated from [[New York University Medical College]] in 1930. Bieber went on to work at [[Yale Medical College]], [[New York University]], and starting in 1953 at the [[New York Medical College]], where he taught a course in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D7153FF93BA1575BC0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies | date=August 28, 1991 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber was, along with [[Lionel Ovesey]] and [[Charles Socarides]], one of the most influential American psychoanalysts who attempted to convert gay men to heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=LeVay, Simon |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |page=75 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber's 1962 book ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'' was a counter reaction to the 1948 [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey Report on male sexual behavior]]. It remained the leading study on [[homosexuality]] until homosexuality was removed from [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="James Baldwin Now"&gt;William J. Spurlin, 'Culture, Rhetoric, and Queer Identity', ''James Baldwin Now'', ed. Dwight A. McBride, New York University Press, 1999, pages 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Bieber attended a meeting of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in [[San Francisco]] that was protested by [[LGBT social movements|gay activists]]. According to Socarides, Bieber, who felt he had "been working all these years to help these people", "took this very hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Socarides, Charles |title=Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far |publisher=Adam Margrave Books |location=Phoenix |year=1995 |page=160 |isbn=0-9646642-5-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the same year the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, Bieber told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim."&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies" /&gt; When [[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith's study ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' was published in 1981, Bieber declared that its findings were "totally disparate" with his experience from psychiatric consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brody, Jane E. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/us/kinsey-study-finds-homosexuals-show-early-predisposition.html?pagewanted=all | title = KINSEY STUDY FINDS HOMOSEXUALS SHOW EARLY PREDISPOSITION | accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieber arranged a partial translation into English of a paper by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pediatrician S. Lindner, who had reported a systematic study of sucking. [[Sigmund Freud]] had used Lindner's observation that sensual sucking seems to absorb the attention completely and leads to either [[sleep]] or an [[orgasm]]-like response to develop his theory of infantile sexuality. Bieber pointed out what he saw as inaccuracies in Freud's use of this paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Macmillan, Malcolm |title=Freud Evaluated: The Completed Arc |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |page=311 |isbn=0-262-63171-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
Describing herself as an "accidental academic" in reference to her working class upbringing, Rodríguez attended [[City College of San Francisco]] before graduating with a Bachelor's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in Liberal Studies. Her graduate degrees include a Masters in English and Comparative Literature from [[Columbia University]], and a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied with [[Norma Alarcón]], [[Judith Butler]], VèVè A. Clark, and [[Gerald Vizenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/faculty-profile-associate-professor-juana-mar%C3%AD-rodr%C3%ADguez-gender-womens-studies|title=FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Associate Professor Juana María Rodríguez, Gender &amp; Women's Studies|last=CRG Editor|first=|date=Fall 2009|website=Faultlines|publisher=Center for Race and Gender|access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Rodríguez was an Assistant Professor of English at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and an Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]] where she served as Director of the Cultural Studies Graduate Group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heymiyuki.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/beyond-the-ivory-tower-interviews-with-academics-1-with-juana-maria-rodriguez/|title=Beyond the Ivory Tower: Interviews with Academics #1 with Juana María Rodríguez|last=Baker|first=Miyuki|date=November 30, 2015|website=|publisher=Word Press|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Berkeley, she is affiliated with the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for New Media, the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture and the [[Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society|Haas Institute for a Fair and Equitable Society]], where she was a founding member of the LGBTQ Citizen Cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, she was appointed to the [[University of California]] President's Advisory Committee on LGBT Students, Staff, and Faculty Member by [[Janet Napolitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/lgbt-advisory-group-advances-recommendations-make-campuses-more-inclusive|title=LGBT advisory group advances recommendations to make campuses more inclusive|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2014|website=University of California|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic contributions ==
The author of two books, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) and ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU 2014), Rodríguez has also published essays in ''[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|GLQ: a Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]]; Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory; [[Radical History Review]]; PMLA; [[MELUS]]; Profession'' and others''.'' Rodríguez's work is considered part of queer of color critique, an intervention into [[queer theory]] that argues that sexuality can not be understood or analyzed outside of the ways it is mutually constituted by race and other dimensions of difference.

=== ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ===
Rodríguez's first book, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) introduced the idea of queer ''[[latinidad]]'' as a way to disarticulate the ways that history, geography, colonialism, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, legal status, immigration status, class, color, and the politics of location exist to complicate facile notions of Latino identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that book, Rodríguez identifies three case studies that involve different understandings of ethnic and sexual identity: activism through the queer Latino/a HIV prevention agency [[Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida]]; law through the [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]] case of Marcelo Tenorio, a gay Brazilian who was granted political asylum in the United States based on sexual persecution; and cyberspace by examining the internet chatrooms of the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat) an early form of digital connectivity.

==== Queering Spanish language ====
In her chapter on the IRC, "'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-Slut" in ''Queer Latinidad'', Rodríguez documents the use of the "@" or arroba in words like Latin@, amig@s, or nostr@s seen in the Spanish language digital spaces she studied, as a "creative linguistic intervention in the highly gendered structure of Spanish." She writes, "Unlike the slash in words such as Latinos/as or amigas/os, which maintains a gender binary while attempting to be inclusive, the @ or "at sign," literally marks where an individual is at in terms of gender."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also discussed the use of the "x" in terms such as Latinx and other approaches to the ungendering or queering of Spanish, although she also argues that gender can also be a site of pleasure and affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Sarah Hayley, and Oscar NÑ. "Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language." ''Latino USA''. N.p., 29 Jan. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' ===
Rodriguez's second book ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU Press 2014) looks at queer kinship practices, [[sodomy law]]s in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latin dance]] styles, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[pornography]], [[burlesque]], [[San Francisco Pride|queer pride]] marches, alongside sexual practices such as [[BDSM]], [[polyamory]], daddy-play, and [[Butch and femme|butch-femme]] role playing to examine the relationship between sexual politics and sexual practices. In the book and elsewhere, she highlights how the [[Respectability politics|politics of respectability]] that surround sexuality inhibit the potential for more radical interventions into public policy and law around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Sara. "Faculty Profile: Juana María Rodríguez on Sexuality in Public Discourse | Haas Institute." ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society''. N.p., 21 Mar. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, she uses the idea of [[gesture]] to emphasize non-verbal ways of communicating gendered and ethnic identity, and as a metaphor to think about activist practices that are partial, in-process and incomplete. The book features queer performance artist [[Xandra Ibarra]], and explores the taboo subject of racialized sexual violence.

==== Sexual practices ====
Rodríguez's work is often specifically praised for the ways in which it deals explicitly with queer sexual practices and forms of gender expression such as butch and femme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dorrance, Jess. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings." ''Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory'' 0.0 (2016): 1–3. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016"&gt;Dominguez, Pier. "The Potentiality of the Latina Femme Gesture." ''GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies'' 22.1 (2016): 143–145. ''glq.dukejournals.org''. Web. 10 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim. "No Sex Please, We're American." ''American Literary History'' (2015): ajv030. ''alh.oxfordjournals.org''. Web. 17 June 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently uses her own sexual experiences, or what she terms "sexual archives" to illuminate her ideas on racialized abjection, feminine subjection, sexual vulnerability, and femme identity. In her writing, she often references the sensory, particularly touch, as a way to articulate an embodied sexual practice and a writing practice rooted in sociality.&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dahl, Ulrika. "The Latina Femme Promise of Vulnerability and Access." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 191–196.

&lt;/ref&gt; In reviews of her work, reviewers frequently remark on her lyrical use of language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Other accomplishments ==

=== Awards ===
In 2015, her book, ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' won the Alan Bray Memorial Book Prize, by the GL/Q Caucus of the [[Modern Language Association]] and was a [[27th Lambda Literary Awards|Lambda Literary Foundation Finalist for LGBT Studies]].

At the University of California, Berkeley, she has won the Social Science Division, Distinguished Teaching Award and the Graduate Assembly's Faculty Mentor Award.

'''''The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''''' ({{lang-it|Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori}}), also known as '''''The Lives''''' ({{lang-it|Le Vite}}), is a series of artist biographies written by 16th-century [[List of Italian painters|Italian painter]] and [[architect]] [[Giorgio Vasari]], which is considered "perhaps the most famous, and even today the most-read work of the older literature of art",&lt;ref name=Gombrich&gt;[http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=18 Max Marmor, ''Kunstliteratur'', translated by [[Ernst Gombrich]], in Art Documentation Vol 11 # 1, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; "some of the Italian Renaissance's most influential writing on art",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webprod1.leeds.ac.uk/banner/dynmodules.asp?Y=200708&amp;M=ITAL-3223 |title=University of Leeds website |publisher=Webprod1.leeds.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the first important book on [[history of art|art history]]".&lt;ref name=mur&gt;[[Peter Murray (art historian)|Murray, P.]] and L. Murray. (1963) ''The art of the renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 8. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is often abridged to just the ''Vite'' or the ''Lives''.

It was first published in two editions with substantial differences between them; the first in 1550 and the second in 1568 (which is the one usually translated and referred to).  One important change was the increased attention paid to Venetian art in the second edition, even though Vasari has still been criticised ever since for an excessive emphasis on the art of his native [[Florence]].

==Background==
As the first Italian art historian, Vasari initiated the genre of an encyclopedia of artistic biographies that continues today. Vasari's work was first published in 1550 by [[Lorenzo Torrentino]] in [[Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcombe.sbc.edu/arth-technology/arth-technology2.html |title=Christopher Witcombe, Art History and Technology |publisher=Witcombe.sbc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]. It included a valuable treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. It was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568 and provided with woodcut [[portraits]] of artists (some conjectural).

The work has a consistent and notorious favour of Florentines and tends to attribute to them all the new developments in Renaissance art—for example, the invention of [[engraving]]. Venetian art in particular, let alone other parts of Europe, is systematically ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangensha.co.jp/allbooks/index/197E.htm |title=Takuma Ito, Studies of Western Art No. 12, July 2007 |publisher=Sangensha.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between his first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including [[Titian]]) without achieving a neutral point of view. [[John Addington Symonds|John Symonds]] claimed in 1899 that, "It is clear that Vasari often wrote with carelessness, confusing dates and places, and taking no pains to verify the truth of his assertions" (in regards to Vasari's life of [[Nicola Pisano]]), while acknowledging that, despite these shortcomings, it is one of the basic sources for information on the Renaissance in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/Renaissance-in-Italy-Vol-32.html |title=John Addington Symonds, '&amp;#39;Renaissance in Italy,'&amp;#39; 1899, Vol. 3, Part 2 |publisher=Fullbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, although likely inventions. Others are generic fictions, such as the tale of young [[Giotto]] painting a fly on the surface of a painting by [[Cimabue]] that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter [[Apelles]]. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and the immediately preceding one. Modern criticism—with all the new materials opened up by research—has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. The work is widely considered a classic even today, though it is widely agreed that it must be supplemented by modern scientific research.

Vasari includes a forty-two-page sketch of his own biography at the end of his ''Vite'', and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and [[Francesco de' Rossi]].

==Influence==
Vasari's ''Vite'' has been described as "by far the most influential single text for the history of Renaissance art"&lt;ref&gt;[http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/graduate_studies/synopses.htm Professor Hope, The [[Warburg Institute]], course synopsis, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001719/http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/graduate_studies/synopses.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most important work of Renaissance biography of artists".&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; Its influence is situated mainly in three domains: as an example for contemporary and later biographers and art historians, as a defining factor in the view on the Renaissance and the role of Florence and Rome in it, and as a major source of information on the lives and works of early Renaissance artists from Italy.

The ''Vite'' has been translated wholly or partially into many languages, including English, Dutch, German, Spanish, French and Russian.

===Early translations became a model for others===
The ''Vite'' formed a model for encyclopedias of artist biographies. Different 17th century translators became artist biographers in their own country of origin and were often called the ''Vasari'' of their country. [[Karel Van Mander]] was probably the first Vasarian author with his ''Painting book'' (''Het Schilderboeck'', 1604), which encompassed not only the first Dutch translation of Vasari, but also the first Dutch translation of Ovid and was accompanied by a list of Italian painters who appeared on the scene after Vasari, and the first comprehensive list of biographies of painters from the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; Similarly, [[Joachim von Sandrart]], author of  ''Deutsche Akademie'' (1675), became known as the "German Vasari" and Antonio Palomino, author of ''[[An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects]]'' (1724), became the "Spanish Vasari".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/the_library_the_transactions_of_the_bibliographical_society/v007/7.4meurer.html |title=Abstract from the transactions of the bibliographical society |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[William Aglionby|Aglionby]]'s ''Painting Illustrated'' from 1685 was largely based on Vasari as well.&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; In Florence the biographies of artists were revised and implemented in the late 17th century by [[Filippo Baldinucci]].

===View of the Renaissance===
The ''Vite'' is also important as the basis for discussions about the development of style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=302111100893994 Elinor Richter, reviewing Philip Sohms study of style in the art theory] :"Giorgio Vasari's Vite, the first edition of which was published in 1550, provides the foundation for any discussion of the development of style."&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the view art historians had of the Early Renaissance for a long time, placing too much emphasis on the achievements of Florentine and Roman artists while ignoring those of the rest of Italy and certainly the artists from the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/renaissance_quarterly/v060/60.1leone.html Stephanie Leone, The Renaissance Society of America, 2007]: "[...] the traditional definition of Renaissance art as the humanistic innovations of Florentine and Roman artists, to which Giorgio Vasari's Vite (1550, 1568) gave rise."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of information===
For centuries, it has been the most important source of information on [[Early Renaissance]] Italian (and especially [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]) painters and the attribution of their paintings. In 1899, [[John Addington Symonds]] used the ''Vite'' as one of his basic sources for the description of artists in his seven books on the ''Renaissance in Italy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11559/11559-h/11559-h.htm |title=Full text of John Symonds' "Renaissance in Italy" |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-03-13 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays it is still, despite its obvious biases and shortcomings, the basis for the biographies of many artists like [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3456 |title=Bernard Barryte, The life of Leonardo da Vinci, University of Rochester Library Bulletin (1984) |publisher=Lib.rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The ''Vite'' contains the biographies of many important Italian artists, and is also adopted as a sort of classical reference guide for their names, which are sometimes used in different ways. The following list respects the order of the book, as divided into its three parts. The book starts with a dedication to [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] and a preface, and then starts with technical and background texts about architecture, sculpture, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; A second preface follows, introducing the actual "Vite" in parts 2 to 5. What follows is the complete list from the second (1568) edition. In a few cases, different very short biographies were given in one section.

A '''music community''' is a group of people involved in a given type of music. Typically such a community has an informal, supportive structure.
In the past such groups have typically developed within a town or school, where the members can meet physically. The internet has made it possible for a more dispersed music community to use the web for communication, either via specialized websites or through broader social media. Ethnographic studies indicate that online music communities do not center around one website, but use a network of sites, including personal blogs, artist or publisher sites and social media.

==General==

The musician and musicologist [[Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin]] has broadly defined a music community as "a group of interested participants who agree on the form and content of the music and its social contexts".{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122}}
A music community may be taken to mean a group of people with strong ties who often come together to play and talk about music, but a sense of community may also come from a national educational system that connects young people to their cultural heritage and traditions.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122–123}}
A more restrictive view limits the term "music community" to teachers, composers, performers and the music distribution industry.{{sfn|National Commission on Music Education|1991|p=xi}}

The concept of music communities is well-developed in [[ethnomusicology]]. A large part of this discipline consists of studies of groups of people who frequently exchange and communicate musical material.{{sfn|Nettl|2005|p=52}}

Barry Shank, writing in 1994 of [[Rock and roll]] in [[Austin, Texas]], used the word "subculture" to define the shifting meanings and membership of musical communities, or cultural spaces. 
Will Straw built on this work, replacing the term "subculture" by "scene".{{sfn|Wolf|2007|p=19}}
Straw saw a "scene" as relatively transient, while a music community is more stable. He wrote in 1991 that a music community engages in "an ongoing exploration of one or more musical idioms said to be rooted within a geographically specific historical heritage."{{sfn|Laughey|2006|p=100}}
Disputing Straw's characterization, later writers have pointed  out that music communities may be mobile and transient.{{sfn|Denzin|2010|p=75}}

Musical communities typically have very flexible structures, voluntary membership and people of a wide range of ages.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
They offer participants the opportunity to play different roles including creator, participant or observer. Conscious efforts may be made to involve disadvantaged members. 
Typically the group encourages diversity, and all members are committed to lifetime learning.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
When a music community is widespread, aspects of music-making such as repertoire and style may evolve and diverge.{{sfn|Brinner|1995|p=75}}

==Types of music community==

There are many types of music community.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
Women's music communities among the Ewe people of Ghana help create bonds and nurture cooperation between women who would otherwise be pulled apart by competition in their polygamist society.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=23}}
Irish immigrants to the United States were generally keen to assimilate and adopt a new ethnic identity as Americans, but a minority held onto their traditional culture and formed [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] communities in [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]] and other cities.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=3}}
After over one hundred years these communities persisted. The primary reason seems to have simply been the entertainment value.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=268}}
Teachers may deliberately foster development of a music community within their school, which can assist students in reaching their full potential.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=4}}
Such teachers may build on the [[Suzuki method]] in the belief that cooperation in group classes plays an important role, and that competition is inappropriate.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=6}}
According to Mary Ann Froehlich, "Competition isolates, while cooperation creates community. ... Our goal is to build an inclusive music community."{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=7}}

==Online music communities==

One of the early online music communities was established in 1996 by [[Oh Boy Records]], a small independent record company. It took the form of a chat page on its website that let fans of [[John Prine]] exchange views and information. The website became the base of a specialized Prine music community.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=295}}
However, as Prine ceased performing while fighting cancer, and no new recordings were released, the community ran out of information to exchange and went into decline.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=299}}
Oh Boy eventually closed the chat page.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=301}}
Another early online music community that was the subject of an ethnographic study was the Banjo Hangout, established in 2000.
As of 2011 it had about 51,000 members and featured a large online learning center.{{sfn|Waldron|2011|p=32}}
[[imeem]], a social networking site with 28 million monthly visitors, was the first music community to provide ad-supported free online music streaming and downloading. 
Other sites such as [[Myspace]] followed with similar services.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=116}}
Specialized software has been developed to support online music communities.{{sfn|Creative Commons Music Communities}}

[[Online communities]] have emerged for genres of folk music such as [[Bluegrass music|Blue Grass]] and [[Old-time music|Old Time]]. [[Cyber-ethnography]] using the framework of [[Étienne Wenger]]'s [[social learning theory]] shows that sites like this may be considered a [[community of practice]] (CoP).{{sfn|Waldron|2009|p=97}}
The members of an online music community can publish, listen to and evaluate the music they have created, giving them a strong sense of membership. It provides a platform within which members can create a musical identity as well as one in which they can build social bonds.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
J. P. Williams, writing in 2006 in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'', argued that the driving force behind online music communities is the interest of the participants in building their identities, despite the ostensible focus on making and sharing music.{{sfn|Rikandi|2010|p=199, 205}}

A 2013 book notes that in Finland the ''Mikseri'' music portal, with about 140,000 registered users, helps people create, share and discuss their music in this sparsely-populated country.
This web-based community was the object of ethnographic studies in 2008 and 2009 based on theories of sociocultural learning.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=50}}
Members of Mikseri do not exclusively belong to that community, but may belong to other real-world or online communities.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
An analysis of event-related data from an online music community shows that events on that site often cause increased interest in a given artist, but propagation over links within digital social communities is also an important factor.{{sfn|Tirado|Higuero|Isaila|Carretero|2011}}
An investigation of the music community of fans of Swedish [[indie music]] showed that they do not gather around one site, but interact with a network of sites including their own fan sites, Myspace, [[Last.fm]], [[YouTube]] and so on.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=143}}

Online discussion forums may provide some of the functions of virtual music communities.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
However, according to Mary McCarthy a music community should teach uninitiated listeners or musicians, and an online group cannot fill this role.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
Only a community of real people in a real place can provide the depth of contact, discussion, sharing and support that the novice musician requires for their development.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=124}}

==Community Music Therapy==

Music Therapy is the use of musical instruments, the audio of already made music or the task of improvisational music to either relieve a symptom that involves speech or memory, but one of the newest uses of music therapy using Community music has been in prisons this has helped rehabilitate prisoners mentally of their criminal struggles as well as their mental struggles with anxiety and depression as studied by Dr Christian Gold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14139">The '''Next Generation Science Standards''' is a multi-state effort in the United States to create new education standards that are "rich in content and practice, arranged in a coherent manner across disciplines and grades to provide all students an internationally benchmarked science education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards were developed by a consortium of 26 states and by the [[National Science Teachers Association]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], and Achieve, a nonprofit organization that was also involved in developing math and English standards.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Gillis |title=New Guidelines Call for Broad Changes in Science Education |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 9, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/science/panel-calls-for-broad-changes-in-science-education.html |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |publisher=Illinois State Board of Education |url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ngss/default.htm |accessdate=May 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507001303/http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ngss/default.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erik |last=Robelen |title=Who Is Writing the 'Next Generation' Science Standards? |journal=Education Week |date=May 14, 2012 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2012/05/who_is_writing_the_next_genera.html |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Revkin |title=New Classroom Science Standards Up for Review |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 18, 2012 |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/new-classroom-science-standards-up-for-review/ |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public was also invited to review the standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Education Officials Seek Public Comment on Science Standards |newspaper=Topeka Capital-Journal |date=January 17, 2013 |url=http://cjonline.com/news/2013-01-17/education-officials-seek-public-comment-science-standards |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations such as the California Science Teachers Association encouraged this feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |publisher=California Science Teachers Association |url=http://www.classroomscience.org/ngss-scheduled-for-release-january-8 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final draft of the standards was released in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erik |last=Robelen |title=Common Science Standards Make Formal Debut |journal=Education Week |date=April 9, 2013 |url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/04/09/28science_ep.h32.html |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==

The purposes of the standards include combatting ignorance of science, creating common standards for teaching in the U.S., and developing greater interest in science among students so that more of them choose to major in science and technology in college. Overall, the guidelines are intended to help students deeply understand core scientific concepts, to understand the scientific process of developing and testing ideas, and to have a greater ability to evaluate scientific evidence. Curricula based on the standards may cover fewer topics, but will go more deeply into specific topics, possibly using a case-study method and emphasizing critical thinking and primary investigation. Possible approaches to implementing the standards may even include replacing traditionally isolated high school courses such as biology and chemistry with a case-study approach that uses a more holistic method of teaching science to consider both (or more) topics within a single classroom structure.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Many education supply companies have already started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers implement these new principles.&lt;ref name=MudWatt&gt;{{cite web |title=MudWatt NGSS Science Kit |url=http://www.mudwatt.com/pages/educational-resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Standards==
The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are based on the "Framework K–12 Science Education" that was created by the National Research Council. They have three dimensions that are integrated in instruction at all levels. The first is core ideas, which consists of specific content and subject areas. The second is science and engineering practices. Students are expected not just to learn content but to understand the methods of scientists and engineers. The third is cross-cutting concepts: key underlying ideas that are common to a number of topics. The NGSS give equal emphasis to engineering design and to scientific inquiry. In addition, they are aligned with the [[Common Core State Standards]] by grade and level of difficulty. The standards describe "performance expectations" for students in the area of science and engineering. They define what students must be able to do in order to show competency.&lt;ref name=NGSS&gt;{{cite web |title=The Next Generation Science Standards: Executive Summary |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |date=June 2013 |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/ngss/files/Final%20Release%20NGSS%20Front%20Matter%20-%206.17.13%20Update_0.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important facet of the standards is that teaching of content is integrated with teaching the practices of scientists and engineers. This is a change from traditional teaching, which typically either dealt with these topics separately or didn't attempt to teach practices. According to NGSS, it is through the integration of content and practice "that science begins to make sense and allows students to apply the material."&lt;ref name=NGSS/&gt;

==Adoption==

Over 40 states have shown interest in the standards,&lt;ref name=NCSE/&gt; and as of November 2017, 19 states, along with the District of Columbia (D.C.), have adopted the standards: Arkansas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arkansas Adopts NGSS for grades K-8 |publisher=NSTA |date=June 17, 2015 |url=http://ngssblog.nsta.org/2015/06/17/arkansas-adopts-ngss-for-grades-k-8/ |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; California, Connecticut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) were adopted by unanimous vote of the Connecticut State Board of Education| date=November 4, 2016 |url=http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/cwp/view.asp?a=2618&amp;q=320890|accessdate=December 11, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Delaware, Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liana |last=Heitin |title=Hawaii Adopts the Next Generation Science Standards|publisher=Education Week | date=February 17, 2016 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2016/02/hawaii_adopts_the_next_generation_science_standards.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-TW|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liana |last=Heitin |title=It's Official: Illinois Adopts Common Science Standards |publisher=Education Week | date=March 25, 2014 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/03/illinois_science_standards_ado.html |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iowa Becomes 15th State to Adopt Next Generation Science Standards|publisher=Education Week |date=August 11, 2015 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2015/08/iowa_adopts_next_generation_science_standards.html |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;http://ped.state.nm.us/ped/NMSTEMReadyScienceStandards.html |accessdate=November 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey, Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oregon adopts the Next Generation Science Standards as the new Oregon Science Standards! |publisher=Oregon Department of Education |date=March 10, 2014 |url=http://www.ode.state.or.us/news/announcements/announcement.aspx?=9699 |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

Unlike the earlier roll-out of the Common Core (CC) math and English standards, states have no financial incentives from federal grants to adopt the Next Generation Science Standards. Previously, adoption of the CC standards was incentivized through states accepting federal grants during the 2009 TARP bailouts. Once states accepted the grant, they accepted the responsibility to adopt "college and career readiness" standards, which didn't have to be CC, but most states chose CC anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-williams/common-core-standards_b_3461006.html |accessdate =December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 26 states involved in developing the NGSS, called Lead State Partners, were Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lead State Partners |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/lead-state-partners |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the standards were released in April 2013, many states were expected to adopt them within one-to-two years. However, according to the ''New York Times'', it would take several more years to actually develop curricula based on the new guidelines, to train teachers in implementing them, and to revise standardized tests.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In addition, the pace of adoption is expected to be slower than was seen with the Common Core State Standards because, unlike Common Core, in which the states had financial incentives to adopt, there are no similar incentives for the NGSS.&lt;ref name=edweek/&gt; Many education supply companies have started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers adopt NGSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open NGSS Resources  |url=https://www.opened.com/search?standard_group=next-generation-science-standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

News reports have suggested there will likely be resistance towards the Next Generations Science Standards from conservatives due to the inclusion of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=NCSE&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution and climate change in the NGSS |publisher=National Center for Science Education |url=http://ncse.com/news/2013/04/evolution-climate-change-ngss-0014800 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Emily |last=Richmond |title=Students Would Learn about Climate Change Under New Teaching Guidelines |magazine=The Atlantic |date=April 10, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/students-would-learn-about-climate-change-under-new-teaching-guidelines/274858/ |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Teresa |last=Watanabe |title=New science standards call for teaching climate change and more |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 9, 2013 |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-science-20130409,0,1524486.story |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Toppo |title=National science standards likely to raise 'ruckus' |newspaper=USA Today |date=April 10, 2013 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/09/science-school-standards/2064791/ |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partners |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/partners |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the New Mexico Public Education Department initially attempted to make changes and deletions in the standards prior to adopting them. According to [[Skeptical Inquirer]], the "proposed changes would have deleted key terms and concepts such as evolution and the 4.6-billion-year age of the Earth. Specifically, 'evolution' would be called 'biological diversity,' the specific age of the Earth would be changed to 'geologic history,' and a 'rise in global temperatures' would be changed to 'temperature fluctuations.'" Following significant protests by the New Mexico Academy of Science, [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]], the Coalition for Excellence in Science and Engineering as well as scientists, educators, and faith leaders, the department announced in October 2017 that it would adopt the standards in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=New Mexico Scientists, Teachers Stop Attempt to Taint Science Standards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11923">A '''nutritionist''' is a person who advises others on matters of food and [[Human nutrition|nutrition]] and their impacts on [[human health]].  Some people specialize in particular areas, such as [[sports nutrition]].

In many countries, a person claiming to be a nutritionist is not required to have any training, education, or any type of [[professional license]].  This differs from becoming a [[dietitian]], which normally requires specific training and a professional license.

==Regulation of the title "nutritionist"==
The terms [[dietitian|''dietitian'']] (also spelled ''dietician'') and ''nutritionist'' are not synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos077.htm United States Bureau of Labor Statistics: ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition''] - ''Dietitians and Nutritionists''. Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries and jurisdictions, the title ''nutritionist'' is not subject to [[healthcare provider requisites|professional regulation]]; thus any person may call themselves a nutritionist/nutrition expert even if they are wholly self-taught.&lt;ref&gt;''Nutrition Encyclopedia'', edited by Delores C.S. James, The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, Australia, parts of Canada, and most US states, the term nutritionist is not legally protected, whereas the title of dietitian can be used only by those who have met specified professional requirements. People who have achieved this standard refer to themselves as [[Registered dietitian|Registered Dietitians]], and use "R.D." after their name. One career counselor attempting to describe the difference between the two professions to Canadian students suggested "all dietitians are nutritionists, but not all nutritionists are dietitians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athabascau.ca/counselling/dietitian.php Athabaska University: ''How to become a Dietitian (or Nutritionist)''], by Julia McDonald, Athabaska University Counselor. Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term nutritionist may be associated with practitioners of [[alternative medicine]]. Prominent examples include [[Gillian McKeith]] and [[Robert O. Young]]. A potential problem with nutritionists is low levels of training and the use or promotion of concepts that are untested or even dangerous, such as [[fad diet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/it-sounds-so-nutritionous/|title=It sounds so “nutritionous”|author=|date=1 July 2010|website=sciencebasedmedicine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
To obtain the Nutritionist title, one must have studied at a recognized university for four years plus a year practice (internship). The nutritionists are registered at the Conselho Regional de Nutricão.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn3.org.br/|title=CRN-3 Conselho Regional de Nutricionistas SP-MS|author=|date=|website=www.crn3.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Nutritionist can prescribe diets, work at hospitals with clinical intervention, or in food production segment.

===Canada===
The title "nutritionist" is protected by provincial law in [[Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. The term "Registered Nutritionist" and "Nutritionist" are protected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/acts/h07.pdf|title=HEALTH PROFESSIONS ACT Schedule 23|author=|date=|website=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Alberta]]. The term “Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist” is protected by law in [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicic.ca/en/professions.aspx?sortcode=2.19.21&amp;prof=3132 Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials: ''Information for foreign-trained dietitians and nutritionists''] Accessed 24 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Nova Scotia Dietetic Association is the regulatory body for professional dietitians and nutritionists in that province, authorized by legislation, the Professional Dietitians Act, "to engage in registration, quality assurance, and when necessary, the discipline of dietitians in Nova Scotia to ensure safe, ethical and competent dietetic practice." Professional requirements include a bachelor's degree in Dietetics/Nutrition from an accredited university, a program of practical training, and successful completion of a registration examination (the "Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination" or CDRE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsdassoc.ca|title=Home - Nova Scotia Dietetic Association|first=Mark|last=Seymour|date=|website=www.nsdassoc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
Qualified Nutritionist: Any person who is the holder of a degree (baccalaureate, master, doctoral) in dietetics, foods, and nutrition awarded by a university or other institution recognized by the Association. Qualified Dietitian: Any person who is currently holder of a degree or a postgraduate diploma in dietetics recognized by the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Dietitian Board), the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, British Dietetic Association and the Dietitians Association of Australia, for full membership or equivalent. Details can be found in the Hong Kong Nutrition Association. Job opportunities available in the Hospitals (Government or Private), private consultation companies. In Hong Kong, more and more people are taking note of the importance of balanced diets. The Government, Heart Foundation, Elderly Associations, etc., are keenly promoting in collaboration with local companies like WeCare Nutritionist and Consultants, Nestle, Anlene, etc., resulting in the urgent needs of nutritional professionals.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===India===
Dietitians and nutritionists in India held about 150,000 jobs in 2011. More than half of all dietitians and nutritionists worked in hospitals, nursing homes, and physician's offices and clinics.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Several professional associations are available to serve nutritionists, dietitians, and food technologists in India, e.g., Nutrition Society of India, Food Scientists and Nutritionists Association India, Indian Dietetic Association, IAPEN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapen.co.in|title=Welcome to The Indian Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (IAPEN)|first=|last=IAPEN|date=|website=www.iapen.co.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

===Morocco===
In Morocco, "Nutritionist" is a protected title and might refer to a researcher in the field of nutrition or to a person who practices therapeutic nutrition. To hold the title of Nutritionist, a person should have carried doctoral studies in the field of nutrition and obtained a Ph.D. degree. On the other hand, the title of "Dietitian" is given to whomever carries studies in nutrition schools for three years and obtains a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]]. However, unlike Nutritionists, Dietitians are not given authorization to open private offices and to practice.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, nutritionists must be registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_dietetics.php Health Professions Council of South Africa: ''Dietetics and Nutrition Professional Board''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323083941/http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_dietetics.php |date=2011-03-23 }} Accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council regulates the professional titles of "Nutritionist", "Student Nutritionist", and "Supplementary Nutritionist", along with "Dietitian", "Student Dietitian", and Supplementary Dietitian". Requirements for eligibility for registration include a recognized bachelor's degree from an accredited educational institution. The undergraduate training should include the three practice areas of therapeutic nutrition, community nutrition, and food service management.

===United Kingdom===
"Nutritionist" is not a protected term in the UK, unlike "[[dietitian]]"; the latter must be registered with the [[Health and Care Professions Council]], so anybody can claim to be a nutritionist. The [[Association for Nutrition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/ "Association for Nutrition"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is a registered charity that holds the UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN).

Since 2002, the number of jobs for nutritionists has reportedly grown faster in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) than in any other sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=840 National Health Service Careers: ''Nutritionist''.] Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it being recognized that nutritionists have an increasingly important role to play in health care in the UK, the NHS employs fewer dietitians each year and the profession itself is shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Broadening career opportunities in dietetics: employment in independent research|date=2012-03-13 |pmid=10405676 | volume=99 |issue=7 |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |pages=799–801 | last1 = Peterson | first1 = DA | last2 = Albers | first2 = JE | last3 = Mertz | first3 = JR | last4 = McCoy | first4 = RA | doi = 10.1016/s0002-8223(99)00190-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Certified Nutrition Specialists (CNS) are advanced nutrition professionals. They typically specialize in [[obesity]] and [[chronic disease]]. In order to become certified, a potential CNS candidate must pass an examination. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including clinical intervention and human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs about CNS Certification – Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists|url = http://cbns.org/faqs-cns-certification/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dietitian|Registered dietitian nutritionist]]s (RD; RDN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an RDN and DTR?|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are health professionals qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Government regulation, especially in terms of licensing, is currently more universal for the RD or RDN than that of CCN.

Certified Clinical Nutritionists (CCN) are trained health professionals who offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaacn.org/ The International &amp; American Associations of Clinical Nutritionist, 2014, Retrieved 2014-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quackwatch]] has accused the group that provides credentialing to CCNs, and its members, of promoting highly dubious medical claims including [[homeopathy]], [[detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], and [[herbalism]].&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nutritionist.html|title=Where To Get Professional Nutrition Advice |publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the use of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet access|internet]] becomes even more widespread, these tools become more valuable and useful in education for the purposes of increasing [[learning]] for students, and [[facilitation (business)|facilitating]] [[conversation]]s between students, parents, and schools.&lt;ref name=sup7/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;

== Overview ==

Online communication emphasizes 21st century skills, [[self-directed learning]], [[self-advocacy]], global awareness, and thinking skills for learners.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"&gt;Watson, J., Gemin, B., &amp; International Association for K-12 Online, L. (2009). Management and Operations of Online Programs: Ensuring Quality and Accountability. Promising Practices in Online Learning. International Association for K-12 Online Learning&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing online communication methods, schools help students develop [[Netiquette]], and technical and [[computer skills]].&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  In addition, teachers can provide parents with frequent information about school programs and their children's progress through automated e-mails, official [[website]]s and [[learning management system]]s.&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt; This communication can be achieved either [[synchronization|synchronously]] or [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly, providing greater time flexibility.&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup9/&gt;

With online communication, learning may occur outside traditional school hours as students participate in collaborative activities, like reading and responding to [[Peer group|peer]] posts in online forums, [[experiment]]s, group [[project]]s, research papers, and current events assignments.&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;   In addition, online communication can connect a wide range of individuals and increase the diversity of [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s that learners are exposed to.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;

However, not all parents, students, or teachers have access to unlimited [[internet access]] or the digital technology necessary to participate in online communication, and it may be costly to initially implement the [[information technology]], [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]], and [[software]].&lt;ref name=sup1/&gt;  Furthermore, schools must provide [[Student orientation|orientation]] to the online environments and [[technical support]] to ensure that all potential [[User (telecommunications)|user]]s are ready to participate.&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  Teachers will also need to spend additional time online as active participants in the communication activities (e.g. act as the [[Forum moderator#Moderators|moderator]]s of discussions).&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;  In addition, the immediacy of online communication can lead to students and parents' unreasonable expectations that teachers be 'on-call' at all times.&lt;ref name=sup1&gt;Southern Regional Education Board (2003). Essential Principles of High-Quality Online Teaching: Guidelines for Evaluating K-12 Online Teachers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online communication between parents and school ==

Online communication between parents and schools are online methods that serve as a [[Computing platform|platform]] for parents and teachers to exchange ideas.  For teachers and administrators, online communication makes it easier to reach the parents and build the partnerships with parents.Online communication allows parents to receive real-time information about their child’s performance and activities at school, and flexible opportunities to ask questions and provide information to teachers and school administrators.

In this recent time of technology and modern educational sector, there are many ways to get instant connectivity with your university or college teachers. In the online education process the communication is playing a major role for both teachers and students. There are many online universities and colleges who offer their education services online and they create a good communication path where all the student and the teacher took participation to discuss with every other and this will also help to get problem resolve very early. For  those professional employees who stop their studies and start doing work. With the online education colleges and universities now they have an opportunity to get complete their education and complete their academic profile by having a higher degree on their resume. If you have a years of work experience in any field, but your employer doesn’t recognize you just because of your degree then there is a good news for you that the online universities also giving you the chance for apply your degree on the basis of your work experience.

=== Benefits ===

Creating [[Mode (literature)|mode]]s for online communication can increase parent participation in their children's education, which in turn increases students’ interest in their learning.  Online communication increases parents’ understanding of classroom [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], [[Philosophy|philosophies]] and [[Policy|policies]].  Parents then feel more involved in their child's school and more connected to the teacher.  In general, online communication improves parents’ attitudes toward conferencing with teachers and administrators.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

This style of communication allows for more asynchronous communication and greater flexibility.  With online communication, parents can initiate conversations and express concerns to teachers and school officials easily.  In addition, informal communication through online [[Online chat|chat]]ting or [[Internet forum|forum]]s can reduce parents’ [[anxiety]] of meeting face-to-face with teachers and/or school officials.  When possible, online communication can also offer comfort through anonymity.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

=== Challenges ===

Though most of the time, teachers and parents want to establish communication, there are some challenges that teacher and parents need to face together.  The most common challenges involve parent’s ability to use the [[software]], their access to consistent [[internet access]] and [[language barrier]]s.  There may be financial costs incurred by the school, if they provide [[training]] or [[translation]] to parents in order to make online communication more inclusive.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;

== Online communication between students and teachers ==

Online communication between teachers and students facilitates the exchange of ideas and [[e-learning]]. Online communication allows students to access learning materials beyond school hours and develop relationships with peers and teachers.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup32/&gt;

=== Benefits ===

The creation of [[Web 2.0]] and [[social networks]] means that knowledge is now [[collective]] and readily available online for students to access and contribute to.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; Promoting online communication between teachers and students creates opportunities for students to receive feedback and assistance from teachers and peers outside the regular school day and classroom.  Student can e-mail or post questions, add their opinions to peer-discussions, and check official websites for pertinent information.

Through online learning communities of teachers and peers, students can build relationships with other users and establish a sense of both [[connectedness]] and belonging.  Some students, who are less likely to participate in face-to discussions, are more likely to participate in [[online discussion]]s and activities.  This online communication enhances the strength of the relationships between students and both their peers and teachers.

=== Challenges ===

Student can demonstrate [[antipathy]] towards online communication or peer [[interdependency]] in internet forums.  In order to be productive, online communication between students and teachers requires [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[interactivity]], common expectations and shared goals.  Some students expect teachers to be on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, placing unreasonable expectations upon teachers.&lt;ref name=sup28/&gt; In addition, most students spend participate in online communication from home, which means that parent's help is often required, but may not be available.  Finally, students may lack the technical skills or access to the technology necessary to involve themselves in online communication.

=== Role of teachers ===

Teachers have great responsibility in the establishment of online communication and [[communities]] with students, because of their leadership position.  Several of their in-class characteristics must extend into the online environment, such as their ability to guide student behavior and learning.  With online communication, teachers must model and demonstrate appropriate Netiquette throughout their persistent involvement.  Teachers should also encourage their classes to evolve into [[learning communities]] in which group processes have the power to influence the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; These online environments should foster a sense of [[openness]], friendliness, and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], so that [[problem solving]] becomes a group function.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup34/&gt;

=== Examples ===

Teachers and students can e-mail questions and answers to each other about course content and assignments.  Schools and teachers can maintain official websites with important information about events, assignments, and resources that students can utilize outside class.&lt;ref name=sup25/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup33/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup45/&gt;

Both students and teachers can post messages in online forums as a part of homework assignments.  In this way they can present different points of view that they don't have any chance to present in the classroom.

Online [[study group]]s  allow students to maintain relationships with their peers from a distance.  These study groups can be created within a classroom’s [[Social-networking sites|social networking site]], allowing users to connect with each other directly, beyond typical chat rooms and forums.

Teachers can develop [[virtual tour]]s, [[virtual education]], and virtual learning environment for their students in [[Multi-User Virtual Environment|multi-user virtual environment]]s (MUVE).

== Technology and tools ==

The most widely used online communication tool is e-mail between teachers, which provides opportunities for asynchronous communication, instantaneous distribution to a mass audience, mobile access, and file exchange.&lt;ref name=sup39/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup40/&gt;  Teacher-created websites provide online access to administrative information, calendars, [[Hyperlink|link]]s, [[blog]]s, etc.  Internet forums allow learners and teachers to articulate ideas, give and receive feedback, reflect on the perspectives of others, and receive clarification of concepts.&lt;ref name=sup37/&gt;  [[List of social networking websites|social networking site]]s are used for focused and open communication between users.  Blogs allow individuals to express their ideas in greater detail and with [[multimedia]].

===Course Management Systems (CMS)===
{{See also|Learning management system|Virtual learning environment}}

Various course management systems are designed specifically for facilitating online communication in education.  Effective course management software tends to include more information, widgets, functions, and customization options than teacher-created websites.

Most course management systems include:
* class information: calendar, [[syllabus]], details of prerequisites, assessment information, and a [[FAQ]]
* a notice board with up-to-date course information
* learning materials: course content, copies of visual aids, reading materials and links to community resources
* assessment opportunities: [[self-assessment]], [[Self- and Peer-Assessment|peer-assessment]], and formal assessment
* communication support: e-mail, [[threaded discussion]]s, and a chat room
* differentiated access rights for teachers, administrators, and students
* document authoring tools
* administrative tools:  student [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] capabilities, [[statistics]], and [[report]]s

Notable CMS Software include:
&lt;!--Entries should have a Wikipedia article, based on multiple independent sources.--&gt;
* [[Chamilo]]
* [[Claroline]]
* [[eFront]]
* [[ILIAS]]
* [[JoomlaLMS]] (a LMS based on Joomla platform)
* [[LAMS]] (Learning Activity Management System)
* [[Moodle]]
* [[Sakai Project|Sakai]]

The '''Patuxent Wildlife Research Center''' is a [[biology|biological]] research center in [[Maryland]]. It is one of 17 research centers in the [[United States]] run by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS). The center is located on the grounds of the {{convert|12841|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Patuxent Research Refuge]], managed by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]. This is the only [[National Wildlife Refuge]] with the purpose of supporting wildlife research.&lt;ref&gt;United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Laurel, MD. [http://www.fws.gov/northeast/patuxent/ "Patuxent Research Refuge."] Accessed 2012-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Patuxent Wildlife Research Center.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Research center entrance]]

== Mission ==
Since its establishment in 1936 as the first wildlife experiment station in the United States, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has been a leading international research institute for wildlife and applied environmental research, for transmitting research findings to those responsible for managing the United States's [[natural resources]], and for providing technical assistance in implementing research findings so as to improve natural resource management.

Patuxent's scientists have been responsible for many important advances in natural resource conservation, especially in such areas as [[migratory birds]], national monitoring programs for amphibians and birds, wildlife population analysis, [[waterfowl]] harvest, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] management, [[wetland]]s, coastal zone and [[flood plain]] management, [[contaminant]]s, [[endangered species]], urban [[wildlife]], [[ecosystem]] management, and management of [[national parks]] and national [[wildlife refuge]]s.

The Center develops and manages national inventory and monitoring programs and is responsible for the [[North American Bird Banding Program]] and leadership of other national [[bird ringing|bird monitoring programs]]. The Center's scientific and technical assistance publications, wildlife databases, and electronic media are used nationally and worldwide in managing biological resources.

[[Image:Patuxent preserve outside.jpg|thumb|left|The research center hosts a wide variety of [[wildlife]].]]
The focus of the Center's mission and vision for the future is to continue its dynamic international, national, and regional leadership in wildlife research. The Center will enhance its accomplishments in generating, interpreting, evaluating, and transmitting the scientific information needed to better address the pressing problems of managing the United States's biological resources, especially those under the stewardship of the [[Department of the Interior]], other Federal and non-Federal partners. Today's challenges in natural resource management involve new approaches such as [[adaptive management]], landscape and ecosystem scale management, partnerships among multiple [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], and transfer and use of the huge store of existing information using modern technology.

The Center is a Federal research facility which primarily supports programs in the Department of the Interior. The USGS Biological Resources Division, of which the Center is a part, works with others to provide the information needed to manage the United States's biological resources. Thus, scientific information needs of partner agencies strongly influence much of the Center's scientific agenda.

The Center also receives funds directly from agencies benefiting from our research and from other partner organizations, such as those co-located at its Laurel headquarters. Such support provides critical resources that enhance the scope and value of the Center's activities, within the mission of the Division.

Science conducted at the Center, like any scientific enterprise, ultimately, is driven by the pressing public natural resource needs coupled with the intellectual creativity and motivation of its scientists and technical staff. No research program will succeed unless it flows from the creative energies of its scientists. The research of Center scientists must be engaged at the cutting edge of scientific understanding to assure the long term success of natural resources management.

== History ==

The land that now comprises the {{convert|12841|acre|km2}} of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center was mostly 
farmland from the colonial period through at least World War I. Well-known landholders such as the Snowden and Duvall families owned substantial amounts of land during the colonial period and well through the 19th century. The legacy of the Snowden family can still be found in two historic homes of the area, one of which ([[Snowden Hall (Laurel, Maryland)|Snowden Hall]]) actually stands on Patuxent Refuge property. In addition to these dwellings, there still exists 19 cemeteries between the center and Fort Meade whose headstones bear the inscriptions of both the Snowdens and Duvalls, in addition to lesser-known surnames such as the Woodwards, Donaldsons, and Waters families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Marking History's Sentiment: Search Reveals Patuxent Graveyards|date=27 November 1997|author=Mary L Schumacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the {{convert|8100|acre|km2}} that makes up what is now called the "North Tract" (the Patuxent River bisects the refuge into the North and Central/South Tracts) were transferred in 1991 from the Defense Department's Fort Meade landholdings. It is here that the history of Patuxent Refuge is most apparent to the everyday visitor. Prior to the Department of Defense's ownership of the land in 1917, many old roads that would eventually be incorporated into use for training exercises by the Army existed. Part of the DOD's Trainfire Road, now known as the Wildlife Loop, once linked the railroad town of Woodwardville with Laurel, Maryland. Long before the area became a densely wooded haven for wildlife amidst a heavily populated urban corridor, the [[Duvall Bridge (Laurel, Maryland)|old Duvall]] and Lemons Bridges transported people between Prince Georges and Anne Arundel Counties. The former still exists as a newer bridge rebuilt in the 1940s, whereas only cement posts along either side of the river offer any vestige of what was Lemon's Bridge. Perhaps the most historic old road of all, which utilized Duvall Bridge, was the old Telegraph Road. It once linked Baltimore and Washington, and today it is still possible to see century-old telegraph poles along the road in both the Central and South Tracts.

In 1946, scientists found that [[DDT]] tests was killing wildlife in tree canopies and causing significant fish kills in the [[Patuxent River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|title=D. D. T. TESTS HARMING FISH: Cause Heavy Mortality Patuxent Refuge Area|date=25 June 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center ended its 51-year effort to breed and train [[whooping cranes]] for release, due to budget cuts by the administration of President [[Donald Trump]]. The flock of 75 birds will move to the [[International Crane Foundation]] and the [[Calgary Zoo]] for continued breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A 50-year effort to raise endangered whooping cranes comes to an end|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/09/18/a-50-year-effort-to-raise-endangered-whooping-cranes-comes-to-an-end/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fort Meade ==
[[Fort George G. Meade]], an active Army base, is near the research center. In October 1991, {{convert|7600|acre|km2}} were transferred from the base to the Patuxent National Research Refuge; in January 1993, another 500 were transferred, as part of Defense Appropriation Bills for 1991 and 1992, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/MD9210020567.htm Fort George G. Meade: Current Site Information], Environmental Protection Agency, retrieved January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2007 environmental impact report described the expansion of Fort Meade, and particularly the proposed two additional 18-hole golf courses, as a "significant threat to the biological and territorial integrity of the Patuxent Research Refuge, a unique national interest in the forefront of scientific research and protection." In response, the Army said that it is taking steps to limit the environmental damage but that the golf courses are needed for "maintaining the quality of life for soldiers and their families."&lt;ref name="Impact"&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Vogel |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/21/AR2007092102124.html |title=U.S. Agency Assails Ft.

''' Peter W. Heller''' (born 5 September 1957) ) is a former Deputy Mayor of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]/Germany, environmental scientist, and venture philanthropist.

== Early life ==
Peter W. Heller was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the son of Wolfgang Heller, entrepreneur in the printing industry, and Ingeborg Heller. He studied economics and philosophy at the [[university of St. Gallen]], [[university of Lausanne]] (Switzerland) and [[university of Freiburg]] (Germany) where he obtained his PhD (Dr. rer.pol.) in 1988 with a thesis on "The Problem of Environmental Degradation in Economic Theory".  In 1988, he married Micaela Heller. They have two children, Julia (born 1989) and Jakob (born 1991).

== Professional career ==
1984 Heller was elected to the City Council of Freiburg and served on the Council’s committees for the municipal budget, environment, and culture. He left the Council in 1990 after his election as Deputy Mayor.

1990 the Council of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] elected him as Deputy Mayor to head the local administration's environmental protection department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1995/34/Alles_Oeko_oder_was_ DIE ZEIT, 34 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; the first of its kind in Southern Germany (until 1996). It comprised the offices of municipal environmental law  and regulations, waste management, urban park and forestry services, local energy  management and climate policy.

1993 the Executive Committee of [[ICLEI]] – Local Governments for Sustainability elected him as Chairman (until 1997). ICLEI is a major global network and agency of local governments committed to environmental protection and local sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner Zeitung: [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/staedte-wollen-regierungen-unter-druck-setzen-linz-baut-eine--solar-city--fuer-25-000-menschen,10810590,8930110.html], abgerufen am 12. März 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 Heller founded the investment company forseo GmbH which holds equity stakes in companies of the solar PV, windpower, and energy efficiency industry. He serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Boards of Streb AG (since 2012) and of Fahrenheit GmbH (since 2018). He co-founded solar PV and windpower development companies in Chile, Brazil and France, and provided seed capital for technology developers in the US and Germany.

Heller is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the [[Canopus Foundation]], a private non-profit organisation which became one of the pioneers of Venture Philanthropy in Germany. Since 2000 the foundation has been providing grants and business development assistance to social enterprises active in the field of rural energy access for low income communities in developing countries. In 2008 the Canopus Foundation and Ashoka International, Arlington Va. (US) jointly founded the Solar for All initiative,.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A.: „Der Frühphasenstifter“.

'''Philip Weller''' (born 1956) is a Canadian environmental scientist.

==Biography==
Philip Weller studied environmental science at the [[University of Waterloo]] in Canada and received a Master of Urban and Regional Planning degree from the same university with a focus on rehabilitation and clean-up of environmental hot spots within the Great Lakes of North America.&lt;ref name=danubewatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Philip Weller and biography in Danube Watch Magazine|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr/static/dw2003_2/dw0203p04.htm|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=February 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he served for four years as director of Great Lakes United dealing with environmental measures in the [[Great Lakes]] area and as a program director of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] International (Danube Carpathian Programme) in Austria. As a consultant, he managed projects in both Canada and Austria and completed assignments for governments and international organisations. Between 2003 and 2013, he was executive secretary of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]]. Since 2013, he is project manager for the International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD).

In February 2000, EU Commissioner for the Environment [[Margot Wallström]] appointed him as a member of the [[Baia Mare]] Task Force. In 2003, he became executive secretary of the ICPDR at its headquarters in Vienna. Philip Weller is author of three books on environmental topics, including ‘Freshwater Seas’, an environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America. He is married to an Austrian and is father of two sons.&lt;ref name=official-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Official biography published by the ICPDR in 2003|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/9392|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=February 20, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170953/http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/9392|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary science''' or, more rarely, '''planetology''', is the scientific study of [[planet]]s (including [[Earth]]), [[Natural satellite|moons]], and [[planetary system]]s (in particular those of the [[Solar System]]) and the processes that form them. It studies objects ranging in size from [[micrometeoroid]]s to [[gas giant]]s, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly [[interdisciplinary]] field, originally growing from [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]],&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; but which now incorporates many disciplines, including [[planetary geology]] (together with [[geochemistry]] and [[geophysics]]), [[cosmochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]], [[hydrology]], [[theoretical planetary science]], [[glaciology]], and [[exoplanetology]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"&gt;{{cite journal

There are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.

Planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. In the case of some exclusive planetary scientists, many of whom are in relation to the study of dark matter, they will seek a private research centre and often initiate partnership research tasks.

==History==
The history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying &lt;blockquote&gt;The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all water.&lt;ref name="Philosophumena"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippolytus (Antipope) |author2=Origen |others=Translation by Francis Legge, F.S.A.|title=Philosophumena|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|location=Original from Harvard University.|date=1921|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lrDy9nn1doC&amp;printsec=titlepage|accessdate=22 May 2009|type=Digitized 9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more modern times, planetary science began in astronomy, from studies of the unresolved planets. In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation "that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface" suggested that it and other worlds might appear "just like the face of the Earth itself".&lt;ref name="Taylor1994b"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1038/369196a0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].

The Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,&lt;ref name="SternPlanetarySoc09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.

==Disciplines==

===Planetary astronomy===
This is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.

Theoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: the application of the principles of [[celestial mechanics]] to the Solar System and [[extrasolar planet]]ary systems.

=== Planetary geology ===
{{main|Planetary geology}}
{{see also|Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Icy moon}}

The best known research topics of planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies in the near vicinity of the Earth: the [[Moon]], and the two neighbouring planets: [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Of these, the Moon was studied first, using methods developed earlier on the Earth.

==== Geomorphology ====
{{main|Geomorphology}}

Geomorphology studies the features on planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history of their formation, inferring the physical processes that acted on the surface. Planetary geomorphology includes the study of several classes of surface features:
* Impact features (multi-ringed basins, craters)
* Volcanic and tectonic features (lava flows, fissures, [[rille]]s)
* [[Space weathering]] - erosional effects generated by the harsh environment of space (continuous micro meteorite bombardment, high-energy particle rain, [[impact gardening]]). For example, the thin dust cover on the surface of the [[moon|lunar]] [[regolith]] is a result of micro meteorite bombardment.
* Hydrological features: the liquid involved can range from water to [[hydrocarbon]] and [[ammonia]], depending on the location within the Solar System.

The history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.
{{further|Geology of the Moon}}

====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====
{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}

One of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.

The different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].

The comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwyo.edu&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.

During the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years –&lt;ref&gt;{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}&lt;/ref&gt; as of
April 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.
Eleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese
Antarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,
Australia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to
50&amp;nbsp;kg.

====Geophysics====
{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}
Space probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.

Geophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].

{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}&lt;!-- used by incoming redirect --&gt;
Planetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.

===Atmospheric science===
{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}
[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]
The [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&amp;nbsp;— too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

The effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.

==Comparative planetary science==

{{main|Comparative planetary science}}

Planetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.

The main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.

[[File:Centre-positive.svg|thumb|Center positive symbol]]
[[File:Centre-negative.svg|thumb|Center negative symbol]]

'''Polarity symbols''' are a notation found on electrical devices that use [[direct current]] (DC) power, when this is or may be provided from an [[alternating current]] (AC) source via an [[AC adapter]].  The adapter typically supplies power to the device through a thin electrical cord which terminates in a [[coaxial power connector]] often referred to as a "barrel plug" (so-named because of its cylindrical shape). The polarity of the adapter cord and plug must match the polarity of the device, meaning that the positive contact of the plug must mate with the positive contact in the receptacle, and the negative plug contact must mate with the negative receptacle contact.  Since there is no standardization of these plugs, a polarity symbol is typically printed on the case indicating which type of plug is needed. 

The commonly used symbol denoting the polarity of a device or adapter consists of a black dot with a line leading to the right and a broken circle (like the letter "C") surrounding the dot and with a line leading to the left. At the ends of the lines leading right and left are found a plus sign (+), meaning positive, and a minus sign (−), meaning negative.

The symbol connected to the dot (usually the symbol found to the right) denotes the polarity of the center/tip, whereas the symbol connected to the broken circle denotes the polarity of the barrel/ring.  When a device or adapter is described simply as having "positive polarity" or "negative polarity", this denotes the polarity of the center/tip.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Artist's rendering ULAS J1120+0641.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist's rendering of the accretion disk in [[ULAS J1120+0641]], a very distant quasar powered by a black hole with a mass two billion times that of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most Distant Quasar Found |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1122/ |accessdate=4 July 2011 |newspaper=ESO Science Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''quasar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ|z|ɑːr}}) (also known as a '''QSO''' or '''quasi-stellar object''') is an extremely [[Luminosity|luminous]] [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN). It has been theorized that most large [[galaxy|galaxies]] contain a [[supermassive black hole|supermassive central black hole]] with mass ranging from millions to [[billion]]s of times the mass of our [[Sun]]. In quasars and other types of AGN, the black hole is surrounded by a gaseous [[accretion disk]]. As gas falls toward the black hole, [[energy]] is released in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], which can be observed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The power radiated by quasars is enormous: the most powerful quasars have [[luminosity|luminosities]] thousands of times greater than a [[galaxy]] such as the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Xue-Bing |display-authors=etal |title=An ultraluminous quasar with a twelve-billion-solar-mass black hole at redshift 6.30 |journal=Nature |date=2015 |volume=518 |issue=7540 |page=512 |doi=10.1038/nature14241 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14241.html |accessdate=5 March 2017 |arxiv = 1502.07418 |bibcode = 2015Natur.518..512W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "quasar" originated as a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of '''quasi-stellar''' ''[star-like]'' '''radio source''', because quasars were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin, and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths they resembled faint star-like points of light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], have demonstrated that quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host galaxies are strongly [[Interacting galaxy|interacting]] or [[Galaxy merger|merging]] galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bahcall |first1=J.

Quasars are found over a very broad range of distances, and quasar discovery surveys have demonstrated that quasar activity was more common in the distant past. The peak epoch of quasar activity was approximately 10 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Maarten |last2=Schneider |first2=Donald |last3=Gunn |first3=James |title=Spectroscopic CCD Surveys for Quasars at Large Redshift.IV.Evolution of the Luminosity Function from Quasars Detected by Their Lyman-Alpha Emission|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=1995 |volume=110 |page=68 |doi=10.1086/117497 |bibcode = 1995AJ....110...68S}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the most distant known quasar is [[ULAS J1342+0928]] at redshift ''z'' = 7.54; light observed from this quasar was emitted when the Universe was only 690 million years old.

==Naming==
The term "quasar" was first used in a paper by Chinese-born U.S. [[astrophysicist]] [[Hong-Yee Chiu]] in May 1964, in ''[[Physics Today]]'', to describe certain astronomically-puzzling objects:

{{quote|So far, the clumsily long name 'quasi-stellar radio sources' is used to describe these objects. Because the nature of these objects is entirely unknown, it is hard to prepare a short, appropriate nomenclature for them so that their essential properties are obvious from their name. For convenience, the abbreviated form 'quasar' will be used throughout this paper.}}

=== Background ===
{{main|Galaxy#Distinction from other nebulae}}
Between 1917 and 1922, it became clear from work by [[Heber Curtis]], [[Ernst Öpik]] and others, that some objects ("[[nebula]]e") seen by astronomers were in fact distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] like our own. But when [[radio astronomy]] commenced in the 1950s, astronomers detected, among the galaxies, a small number of anomalous objects with properties that defied explanation.

The objects emitted large amounts of radiation of many frequencies, but no source could be located optically, or in some cases only a faint and [[point-like]] object somewhat like a distant [[star]]. The [[spectral line]]s of these objects, which identify the [[chemical element]]s of which the object is composed, were also extremely strange and defied explanation. Some of them changed their [[luminosity]] very rapidly in the optical range and even more rapidly in the X-ray range, suggesting an upper limit on their size, perhaps no larger than our own [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/35/text/ |title=Hubble Surveys the "Homes" of Quasars |publisher=HubbleSite |date=1996-11-19 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies an extremely high [[power density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/astrophysics/astro-chapter7.html |title=7. HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION|publisher=Neutrino.aquaphoenix.com |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable discussion took place over what these objects might be. They were described as ''"quasi-stellar'' [meaning: star-like] ''radio sources"'', or ''"quasi-stellar objects"'' (QSOs), a name which reflected their unknown nature, and this became shortened to "quasar".

=== Early observations (1960s and earlier) ===
The first quasars ([[3C 48]] and [[3C 273]]) were discovered in the late 1950s, as radio sources in all-sky radio surveys.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=Gregory A.|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF AGN|journal=The Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|pages=661–678|accessdate=3 October 2014|url=http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Shields/Shields3.html|doi=10.1086/316378|arxiv = astro-ph/9903401 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..661S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Activities|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/18_June/(print)|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthews, Thomas A. |author-link = Thomas A.

Using small telescopes and the [[Lovell Telescope]] as an interferometer, they were shown to have a very small angular size.&lt;ref name="jbo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/public/story/mk1quasars.html |title=The MKI and the discovery of Quasars |publisher=[[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of these objects were recorded by 1960 and published in the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue]] as astronomers scanned the skies for their optical counterparts. In 1963, a definite identification of the radio source [[3C 48]] with an optical object was published by [[Allan Sandage]] and [[Thomas A. Matthews]]. Astronomers had detected what appeared to be a faint blue star at the location of the radio source and obtained its spectrum, which contained many unknown broad emission lines. The anomalous spectrum defied interpretation.

[[British-Australian people|British-Australian]] astronomer [[John Gatenby Bolton|John Bolton]] made many early observations of quasars, including a breakthrough in 1962. Another radio source, [[3C 273]], was predicted to undergo five [[occultations]] by [[the Moon]]. Measurements taken by [[Cyril Hazard]] and John Bolton during one of the occultations using the [[Parkes Radio Telescope]] allowed [[Maarten Schmidt]] to find a visible counterpart to the radio source and obtain an [[optical spectrum]] using the 200-inch [[Hale Telescope]] on Mount Palomar. This spectrum revealed the same strange emission lines. Schmidt was able to demonstrate that these were likely to be the ordinary [[spectral line]]s of hydrogen redshifted by 15.8 percent - an extreme redshift never seen in astronomy before. If this was due to the physical motion of the "star", then 3C&amp;nbsp;273 was receding at an enormous velocity, around 47,000&amp;nbsp;km/s, far beyond the speed of any known star and defying any obvious explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor would an extreme velocity help to explain 3C 273's huge radio emissions.

Although it raised many questions, Schmidt's discovery quickly revolutionized quasar observation. The strange spectrum of [[3C 48]] was quickly identified by Schmidt, Greenstein and Oke as hydrogen and [[magnesium]] redshifted by 37%. Shortly afterwards, two more quasar spectra in 1964 and five more in 1965, were also confirmed as ordinary light that had been redshifted to an extreme degree.&lt;ref name="Caltech_p3"&gt;http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Shields/Shields3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the observations and redshifts themselves were not doubted, their correct interpretation was heavily debated, and Bolton's suggestion that the radiation detected from quasars were ordinary [[spectral line]]s from distant highly redshifted sources with extreme velocity was not widely accepted at the time.

=== Development of physical understanding (1960s) ===
{{main|Redshift|Metric expansion of space|Universe}}
An extreme redshift could imply great distance and velocity, but could also be due to extreme mass, or perhaps some other unknown laws of nature. Extreme velocity and distance would also imply immense power output, which lacked explanation, and conflicted with the traditional and predominant [[Steady State theory]] of the universe. The small sizes were confirmed by [[interferometry]] and by observing the speed with which the quasar as a whole varied in output, and by their inability to be seen in even the most powerful visible light telescopes as anything more than faint starlike points of light. But if they were small and far away in space, their power output would have to be immense, and difficult to explain. Equally if they were very small and much closer to our galaxy, it would be easy to explain their apparent power output, but less easy to explain their redshifts and lack of detectable movement against the background of the universe.

Schmidt noted that redshift is also associated with the expansion of the universe, as codified in [[Hubble's law]]. If the measured redshift was due to expansion, then this would support an interpretation of very distant objects with extraordinarily high [[luminosity]] and power output, far beyond any object seen to date. This extreme luminosity would also explain the large radio signal. Schmidt concluded that 3C 273 could either be an individual star around 10km wide within (or near to) our galaxy, or a distant active galactic nucleus. He stated that a distant and extremely powerful object seemed more likely to be correct.&lt;ref name="schmidt1963"&gt;{{cite journal

Schmidt's explanation for the high redshift was not widely accepted at the time. A major concern was the enormous amount of energy these objects would have to be radiating, if they were distant. In the 1960s no commonly-accepted mechanism could account for this. The currently accepted explanation, that it is due to [[matter]] in an [[accretion disc]] falling into a supermassive black hole, was only suggested in 1964 by [[Edwin Ernest Salpeter|Salpeter]] and [[Yakov Zel'dovich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=G.

The strange [[spectral line]]s in their radiation, and the speed of change seen in some quasars, also suggested to many astronomers and cosmologists that the objects were comparatively small and therefore perhaps bright, massive and not far away; accordingly that their redshifts were not due to distance or velocity, and must be due to some other reason or an unknown process, meaning that the quasars were not really powerful objects nor at extreme distances, as their redshifted light [[Hubble law|implied]]. A common alternative explanation was that the redshifts were caused by extreme mass ([[gravitational redshift]]ing explained by [[general relativity]]) and not by extreme velocity (explained by [[special relativity]]). 

Various explanations were proposed during the 1960s and 1970s, each with their own problems. It was suggested that quasars were nearby objects, and that their redshift was not due to the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|expansion of space]] ([[special relativity]]) but rather to [[gravitational redshift|light escaping a deep gravitational well]] ([[general relativity]]). This would require a massive object, which would also explain the high luminosities. However a star of sufficient mass to produce the measured redshift would be unstable and in excess of the [[Hayashi limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.

One strong argument against them was that they implied energies that were far in excess of known energy conversion processes, including [[nuclear fusion]]. There were some suggestions that quasars were made of some hitherto unknown form of stable [[antimatter]] regions and that this might account for their brightness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/206175a0 nature.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Others speculated that quasars were a [[white hole]] end of a [[wormhole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynch |first1=Kendall Haven; illustrated by Jason |title=That's weird! : awesome science mysteries |date=2001 |publisher=Fulcrum Resources |location=Golden, Colo. |isbn=9781555919993|pages=39–41 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2zVo1lirhi4C&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Santilli |first1=Ruggero Maria |title=Isodual theory of antimatter : with applications to antigravity, grand unification and cosmology |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-4517-2 |page=304 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xJwUB--qflEC&amp;pg=PA304}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[chain reaction]] of numerous [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref name="Caltech_ipac_4"&gt;[http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Shields/Shields4_2.html ned.ipac.caltech.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The uncertainty was such that even as late as 1984, it was stated that "one of the few statements [about Active Galactic Nuclei] to command general agreement has been that the power supply is primarily gravitational",&lt;ref&gt;[http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Rees/frames.html ned.ipac.caltech.edu], Martin Rees: ''Black hole models for active galactic nuclei'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; with the cosmological origin of the redshift being taken as given.

Eventually, starting from about the 1970s, many lines of evidence (including [[Uhuru (satellite)|the first]] [[X-Ray]] [[space observatory|space observatories]], knowledge of [[black hole]]s and modern models of [[cosmology]]) gradually demonstrated that the quasar redshifts are genuine, and due to the [[expansion of space]], that quasars are in fact as powerful and as distant as Schmidt and some other astronomers had suggested, and that their energy source is matter from an [[accretion disc]] falling onto a supermassive black hole.&lt;ref name=keel2009&gt;{{cite web |first=William C. |last=Keel |date=October 2009 |title=Alternate Approaches and the Redshift Controversy |publisher=The University of Alabama |url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/arp.html |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included crucial evidence from optical and X-Ray viewing of quasar host galaxies, finding of 'intervening' absorption lines which explained various spectral anomalies, observations from [[gravitational lensing]], Peterson and Gunn's 1971 finding that galaxies containing quasars showed the same redshift as the quasars, and Kristian's 1973 finding that the "fuzzy" surrounding of many quasars was consistent with a less luminous host galaxy.

This model also fits well with other observations that suggest many or even most galaxies have a massive central black hole. It would also explain why quasars are more common in the early universe: as a quasar draws matter from their accretion disc, there will come a point where there is less matter nearby, and energy production falls off or ceases as the quasar becomes a more ordinary type of galaxy.

The [[accretion disc]] energy-production mechanism was finally modeled in the 1970s, and black holes were also directly detected (including evidence showing that supermassive black holes could be found at the centers of our own and many other galaxies), which resolved the concern that quasars were too luminous to be a result of very distant objects or that a suitable mechanism could not be confirmed to exist in nature. By 1987 it was "well accepted" that this was the correct explanation for quasars,&lt;ref name="thomsen_1987"/&gt; and the cosmological distance and energy output of quasars was accepted by almost all researchers.

===Modern observations (1970s onward)===

Later it was found that not all quasars have strong radio emission; in fact only about 10% are "radio-loud". Hence the name 'QSO' (quasi-stellar object) is used (in addition to "quasar") to refer to these objects, including the 'radio-loud' and the 'radio-quiet' classes. The discovery of the quasar had large implications for the field of astronomy in the 1960s, including drawing physics and astronomy closer together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Swart |first1=J.

== Current understanding==
It is now known that quasars are distant but extremely luminous objects, so any light which reaches the [[Earth]] is redshifted due to the [[metric expansion of space]].&lt;ref name=grupen_cowan2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Grupen, Claus |author2=Cowan, Glen |title=Astroparticle physics |pages=11–12 |publisher=Springer |date=2005 |isbn=3-540-25312-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Quasars inhabit the center of active galaxies, and are among the most luminous, powerful, and energetic objects known in the universe, emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the [[Milky Way]], which contains 200–400 billion stars. This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum, almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far-infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet-optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of radio emission and of gamma-rays. With high-resolution imaging from ground-based telescopes and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the "host galaxies" surrounding the quasars have been detected in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/35/image/a/ Hubble Surveys the "Homes" of Quasars] Hubblesite News Archive, 1996–35&lt;/ref&gt; These galaxies are normally too dim to be seen against the glare of the quasar, except with special techniques. Most quasars, with the exception of [[3C 273]] whose average [[apparent magnitude]] is 12.9, cannot be seen with small telescopes.

Quasars are believed - and in many cases confirmed - to be powered by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of material into supermassive black holes in the nuclei of distant galaxies, as suggested in 1964 by [[Edwin Salpeter]] and [[Yakov Zel'dovich]]&lt;ref name="Shields" /&gt;. Light and other radiation cannot escape from within the [[event horizon]] of a black hole, but the energy produced by a quasar is generated ''outside'' the black hole, by gravitational stresses and immense [[friction]] within the material nearest to the black hole, as it orbits and falls inward.&lt;ref name="thomsen_1987"&gt;{{cite journal |title = End of the World: You Won't Feel a Thing |first = D.

Central masses of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es have been measured in quasars by using [[reverberation mapping]]. Several dozen nearby large galaxies, including our own [[Milky Way]] galaxy, that do not have an active center and do not show any activity similar to a quasar, are confirmed to contain a similar supermassive black hole in their [[galactic nucleus|nuclei (galactic center)]]. Thus it is now thought that all large galaxies have a black hole of this kind, but only a small fraction have sufficient matter in the right kind of orbit at their center to become active and power radiation in such a way as to be seen as quasars.&lt;ref name=DiMatteo2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tiziana Di Matteo, et al. |title=Energy input from quasars regulates the growth and activity of black holes and their host galaxies |journal=Nature |date=10 February 2005 |volume=433 |page=604–607 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03335}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This also explains why quasars were more common in the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. This means that it is possible that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy that depended on the black hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now quiescent because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.&lt;ref name="DiMatteo2005" /&gt;

The matter accreting onto the black hole is unlikely to fall directly in, but will have some angular momentum around the black hole that will cause the matter to collect into an [[accretion disc]]. Quasars may also be ignited or re-ignited when normal galaxies merge and the black hole is infused with a fresh source of matter. In fact, it has been suggested that a quasar could form when the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] collides with our own [[Milky Way]] galaxy in approximately 3–5 billion years.&lt;ref name="thomsen_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galaxydynamics.org/papers/GreatMilkyWayAndromedaCollision.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217134733/http://www.galaxydynamics.org/papers/GreatMilkyWayAndromedaCollision.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~tcox/localgroup/lg.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202184123/http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~tcox/localgroup/lg.pdf |archivedate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, unified models were developed in which quasars were classified as a particular kind of [[active galaxy]], and a consensus emerged that in many cases it is simply the viewing angle that distinguishes them from other active galaxies, such as [[blazar]]s and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk/full/1989ApJ...336..606B |title=Peter J.

The highest redshift quasar known ({{As of|2011|06|lc=on}}) is [[ULAS J1120+0641]], with a redshift of 7.085, which corresponds to a [[comoving distance]] of approximately 29 billion [[light-year]]s from Earth (these distances are much larger than the distance light could travel in the universe's 13.8 billion year history because [[Metric expansion of space#How are distances between two points measured if space is expanding?|space itself has also been expanding]]).

More than 200,000 quasars are known, most from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]. All observed quasar spectra have redshifts between 0.056 and 7.085. Applying [[Hubble's law]] to these redshifts, it can be shown that they are between 600 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1994/1994/42/text/ |title=Hubble Uncovers a Hidden Quasar in a Nearby Galaxy (Cygnus A) |publisher=HubbleSite |date=1994-09-21 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 28.85 billion light-years away (in terms of [[comoving distance]]). Because of the great distances to the farthest quasars and the finite velocity of light, they and their surrounding space appear as they existed in the very early universe.

The power of quasars originates from supermassive black holes that are believed to exist at the core of most galaxies. The Doppler shifts of stars near the cores of galaxies indicate that they are rotating around tremendous masses with very steep gravity gradients, suggesting black holes.

Although quasars appear faint when viewed from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most luminous objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is [[3C 273|3C&amp;nbsp;273]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. It has an average [[apparent magnitude]] of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur [[telescope]]), but it has an [[absolute magnitude]] of −26.7.&lt;ref name="3C 273 article"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Quasi-Stellar Radio Sources 3C 48 and 3C 273 |bibcode=1964ApJ...140....1G |journal=The Astrophysical Journal|doi = 10.1086/147889 |volume=140 |pages=1 |year=1964 |last1=Greenstein |first1=Jesse L. |last2=Schmidt|first2=Maarten}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From a distance of about 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as our [[sun]]. This quasar's [[luminosity]] is, therefore, about 4 trillion (4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="3C 273 article" /&gt; This assumes the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei billions of years ago but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be pointed toward the Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases it is likely that the brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth. Such quasars are called [[blazars]].

The hyperluminous quasar [[APM 08279+5255]] was, when discovered in 1998, given an [[absolute magnitude]] of −32.2. High resolution imaging with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and the 10&amp;nbsp;m [[Keck Telescope]] revealed that this system is [[gravitational lensing|gravitationally lensed]]. A study of the gravitational lensing of this system suggests that the light emitted has been magnified by a factor of ~10. It is still substantially more luminous than nearby quasars such as 3C&amp;nbsp;273.

Quasars were much more common in the early universe than they are today. This discovery by [[Maarten Schmidt]] in 1967 was early strong evidence against [[Steady state theory|Steady State cosmology]] and in favor of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. Quasars show the locations where massive black holes are growing rapidly (via [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]). These black holes grow in step with the mass of stars in their host galaxy in a way not understood at present. One idea is that jets, radiation and winds created by the quasars, shut down the formation of new stars in the host galaxy, a process called 'feedback'. The jets that produce strong radio emission in some quasars at the centers of [[clusters of galaxies]] are known to have enough power to prevent the hot gas in those clusters from cooling and falling onto the central galaxy.

Quasars' luminosities are variable, with time scales that range from months to hours. This means that quasars generate and emit their energy from a very small region, since each part of the quasar would have to be in contact with other parts on such a time scale as to allow the coordination of the luminosity variations. This would mean that a quasar varying on a time scale of a few weeks cannot be larger than a few light-weeks across. The emission of large amounts of power from a small region requires a power source far more efficient than the nuclear fusion that powers stars. The conversion of [[gravitational potential energy]] to radiation by infalling to a black hole converts between 6% and 32% of the mass to energy, compared to 0.7% for the conversion of mass to energy in a star like our sun.&lt;ref name="Lambourne" /&gt; It is the only process known that can produce such high power over a very long term. (Stellar explosions such as [[supernova]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s, and direct [[matter]]-[[antimatter]] annihilation, can also produce very high power output, but supernovae only last for days, and the universe does not appear to have had large amounts of antimatter at the relevant times).

[[File:Artist's impression of mysterious alignment of quasar rotation axes.ogv|thumb|Animation shows the alignments between the spin axes of quasars and the large-scale structures that they inhabit.]]

Since quasars exhibit all the properties common to other [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] such as [[Seyfert galaxies]], the emission from quasars can be readily compared to those of smaller active galaxies powered by smaller supermassive black holes. To create a luminosity of 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[watt]]s (the typical brightness of a quasar), a super-massive black hole would have to consume the material equivalent of 10 stars per year. The brightest known quasars devour 1000 solar masses of material every year. The largest known is estimated to consume matter equivalent to 600 Earths per minute. Quasar luminosities can vary considerably over time, depending on their surroundings. Since it is difficult to fuel quasars for many billions of years, after a quasar finishes accreting the surrounding gas and dust, it becomes an ordinary galaxy. 

Radiation from quasars is partially 'nonthermal' (i.e., not due to [[black body]] radiation), and approximately 10 percent are observed to also have jets and lobes like those of [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]] that also carry significant (but poorly understood) amounts of energy in the form of particles moving at [[relativistic speed]]s. Extremely high energies might be explained by several mechanisms (see [[Fermi acceleration]] and [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]). Quasars can be detected over the entire observable [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including [[radio waves|radio]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]] and even [[gamma ray]]s. Most quasars are brightest in their rest-frame near-ultraviolet [[wavelength]] of 121.6 [[nanometer|nm]] [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] emission line of hydrogen, but due to the tremendous redshifts of these sources, that peak luminosity has been observed as far to the red as 900.0&amp;nbsp;nm, in the near infrared. A minority of quasars show strong radio emission, which is generated by jets of matter moving close to the speed of light. When viewed downward, these appear as [[blazar]]s and often have regions that seem to move away from the center faster than the speed of light ([[superluminal]] expansion). This is an optical illusion due to the properties of [[special relativity]].

Quasar redshifts are measured from the strong [[spectral line]]s that dominate their visible and ultraviolet emission spectra. These lines are brighter than the continuous spectrum. They exhibit [[Doppler broadening]] corresponding to mean speed of several percent of the speed of light. Fast motions strongly indicate a large mass. Emission lines of hydrogen (mainly of the [[Lyman series]] and [[Balmer series]]), helium, carbon, magnesium, iron and oxygen are the brightest lines. The atoms emitting these lines range from neutral to highly ionized, leaving it highly charged. This wide range of ionization shows that the gas is highly irradiated by the quasar, not merely hot, and not by stars, which cannot produce such a wide range of ionization.

Like all (unobscured) active galaxies, quasars can be strong X-ray sources. Radio-loud quasars can also produce X-rays and gamma rays by [[inverse Compton scattering]] of lower-energy photons by the radio-emitting electrons in the jet.&lt;ref name=Dooling&gt;{{cite web |author=Dooling D |title=BATSE finds most distant quasar yet seen in soft gamma rays Discovery will provide insight on formation of galaxies |url=https://science.nasa.gov/NEWHOME/HEADLINES/ast24nov99_1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723104615/http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast24nov99_1.htm |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprint of the early Universe.jpg|left|thumb|Spectrum from quasar HE0940-1050 after it has travelled through [[intergalactic medium]].]]

Quasars also provide some clues as to the end of the [[Big Bang]]'s [[reionization]]. The oldest known quasars (redshift = 6) display a [[Gunn-Peterson trough]] and have absorption regions in front of them indicating that the [[intergalactic medium]] at that time was [[neutral gas]]. More recent quasars show no absorption region but rather their spectra contain a spiky area known as the [[Lyman-alpha forest]]; this indicates that the intergalactic medium has undergone reionization into [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and that neutral gas exists only in small clouds. 

The intense production of [[ionization|ionizing]] [[ultraviolet]] radiation is also significant, as it would provide a mechanism for reionization to occur as galaxies form. Despite this, current theories suggest that quasars were not the primary source of reionization; the primary causes of reionization were probably the earliest generations of [[star]]s, known as [[Population III]] stars (possibly 70%), and [[dwarf galaxies]] (very early small high-energy galaxies) (possibly 30%),&lt;ref name="popIII_sim"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickolay Gnedin |author2=Jeremiah Ostriker |date=1997 |title=Reionization of the Universe and the Early Production of Metals |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=486 |issue=2 |pages=581–598 |bibcode=1997ApJ...486..581G |doi=10.1086/304548 |arxiv = astro-ph/9612127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qso_z"&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=Limin Lu |date=1998 |title=The Metal Contents of Very Low Column Density Lyman-alpha Clouds: Implications for the Origin of Heavy Elements in the Intergalactic Medium |eprint=astro-ph/9802189 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bouwens_LLG&gt;{{cite journal |author=R.J.Bouwens |display-authors=etal |title=Lower-luminosity Galaxies Could Reionize the Universe: Very Steep Faint-end Slopes to the UV Luminosity Functions at z &gt;= 5–8 from the HUDF09 WFC3/IR Observations |date=2012 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=752 |issue=1 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/752/1/L5 |bibcode=2012ApJ...752L...5B |arxiv=1105.2038| pages=L5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Piero Madau |display-authors=etal |date=1999 |title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

Quasars show evidence of elements heavier than [[helium]], indicating that galaxies underwent a massive phase of [[star formation]], creating [[population III stars]] between the time of the [[Big Bang]] and the first observed quasars. Light from these stars may have been observed in 2005 using [[NASA]]'s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/universe_objects.html |title=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center: News of light that may be from population III stars |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this observation remains to be confirmed.

== Quasar subtypes ==
The [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of quasars includes various subtypes representing subsets of the quasar population having distinct properties. 

* '''Radio-loud quasars''' are quasars with powerful [[Astrophysical jet|jets]] that are strong sources of radio-wavelength emission. These make up about 10% of the overall quasar population.&lt;ref name="peterson1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=Bradley |title=Active Galactic Nuclei |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0 521 47911 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radio-quiet quasars''' are those quasars lacking powerful jets, with relatively weaker radio emission than the radio-loud population. The majority of quasars (about 90%) are radio-quiet.&lt;ref name="peterson1997" /&gt;
* '''Broad absorption-line (BAL) quasars''' are quasars whose spectra exhibit broad absorption lines that are blueshifted relative to the quasar's rest frame, resulting from gas flowing outward from the active nucleus in the direction toward the observer. Broad absorption lines are found in about 10% of quasars, and BAL quasars are usually radio-quiet.&lt;ref name="peterson1997" /&gt; In the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of BAL quasars, broad absorption lines can be detected from ionized carbon, magnesium, silicon, nitrogen, and other elements.
* '''Type 2 (or Type II) quasars''' are quasars in which the accretion disk and broad emission lines are highly obscured by dense gas and [[Cosmic dust|dust]]. They are higher-luminosity counterparts of Type 2 Seyfert galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zakamska |first1=Nadia |display-authors=etal|title=Candidate Type II Quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I. Selection and Optical Properties of a Sample at 0.3&lt;Z&lt;0.83 |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=2002 |volume=126 |issue=5 |page=2125 |doi=10.1086/378610 |bibcode=2003AJ....126.2125Z |arxiv=astro-ph/0309551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Red quasars''' are quasars with optical colors that are redder than normal quasars, thought to be the result of moderate levels of dust [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] within the quasar host galaxy. Infrared surveys have demonstrated that red quasars make up a substantial fraction of the total quasar population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glikman |first1=Eilat |display-authors=et al |title=The FIRST-2MASS Red Quasar Survey |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=2007 |volume=667 |issue=2 |page=673 |doi=10.1086/521073 |bibcode=2007ApJ...667..673G|arxiv=0706.3222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Optically Violent Variable]] (OVV) quasars''' are radio-loud quasars in which the jet is directed toward the observer. Relativistic beaming of the jet emission results in strong and rapid variability of the quasar brightness. OVV quasars are also considered to be a type of [[blazar]].
* '''Weak emission line quasars''' are quasars having unusually faint emission lines in the ultraviolet/optical spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diamond-Stanic |first1=Aleksandar |display-authors=etal|title=High-redshift SDSS Quasars with Weak Emission Lines |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=2009 |volume=699 |page=782 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/782 |bibcode=2009ApJ...699..782D|arxiv=0904.2181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in celestial reference systems==
[[File:Quasar HE 0109-3518.tiff|thumb|The energetic radiation of the quasar makes [[dark galaxy|dark galaxies]] glow, helping astronomers to understand the obscure early stages of galaxy formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dark Galaxies of the Early Universe Spotted for the First Time |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1228/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Because quasars are extremely distant, bright, and small in apparent size, they are useful reference points in establishing a measurement grid on the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php |title=ICRS Narrative |accessdate=2012-06-07 |publisher=&lt;!---http://aa.usno.navy.mil/index.php---&gt;U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) is based on hundreds of extra-galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to our current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 [[arc minute|arcsecond]] or better, which is orders of magnitude more precise than the best optical measurements.

==Multiple quasars==
A multiple-image quasar is a quasar whose light undergoes [[gravitational lensing]], resulting in double, triple or quadruple images of the same quasar. The first such gravitational lens to be discovered was the double-imaged quasar [[Q0957+561]] (or Twin Quasar) in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blandford, R. D. |author-link=Roger Blandford |author2=Narayan, R. |date=1992 |title=Cosmological applications of gravitational lensing |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.30.090192.001523  |volume=30 |pages=311–358 |bibcode=1992ARA&amp;A..30..311B}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grouping of two or more quasars can result from a chance alignment, physical proximity, actual close physical interaction, or effects of gravity bending the light of a single quasar into two or more images.

As quasars are rare objects, the probability of three or more separate quasars being found near the same location is very low. The first true triple quasar was found in 2007 by observations at the [[W. M. Keck Observatory]] [[Mauna Kea]], [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Rincon |authorlink=Paul Rincon |date=2007-01-09 |title=Astronomers see first quasar trio |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6243361.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LBQS 1429-008]] (or QQQ J1432-0106) was first observed in 1989 and was found to be a double quasar; itself a rare occurrence. When [[astronomer]]s discovered the third member, they confirmed that the sources were separate and not the result of gravitational lensing. This triple quasar has a red shift of ''z'' = 2.076, which is equivalent to 10.5&amp;nbsp;billion light-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Triple quasar QQQ 1429-008 |publisher=ESO |accessdate=2009-04-23 |url=http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Quasars/phot-02-07.jpg.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208213256/http://eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Quasars/phot-02-07.jpg.html |archivedate=2009-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The components are separated by an estimated 30–50 kpc, which is typical of interacting galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Djorgovski, S.

In 2013, the second true triplet quasars QQQ J1519+0627 was found with redshift ''z'' = 1.51 (approx 9 billion light-years) by an international team of astronomers led by Farina of the University of Insubria, the whole system is well accommodated within 25'' (i.e., 200 kpc in projected distance). The team accessed data from observations collected at the [[La Silla Observatory]] with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) of the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) and at the [[Calar Alto Observatory]] with the 3.5 m telescope of the ''Centro Astronómico Hispano Alemán'' (CAHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Extremely rare triple quasar found |publisher=phys.org |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-03-extremely-rare-triple-quasar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farina, E.P. |display-authors=et al |title=Caught in the Act: Discovery of a Physical Quasar Triplet |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |arxiv=1302.0849v1 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stt209 |volume=431 |issue=2 |pages=1019–1025 |bibcode = 2013MNRAS.431.1019F |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first quadruple quasar was discovered in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Surprise Quasar Quartet Defies Explanation |publisher = news.discovery.com |accessdate = 2015-05-17 |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/galaxies/surprise-quasar-quartet-defies-explanation-150514.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two quasars are so nearly in the same direction as seen from Earth that they appear to be a single quasar but may be separated by the use of telescopes, they are referred to as a "double quasar", such as the Twin Quasar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmological physics |series=Cambridge Astrophysics series |first=John A. |last=Peacock |authorlink=John A. Peacock |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=t8O-yylU0j0C&amp;pg=PA113|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1998 |isbn=0521422701 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are two different quasars, and not the same quasar that is gravitationally lensed. This configuration is similar to the optical [[double star]]. Two quasars, a "quasar pair", may be closely related in time and space, and be gravitationally bound to one another. These may take the form of two quasars in the same [[galaxy cluster]]. This configuration is similar to two prominent stars in a [[star cluster]]. A "binary quasar", may be closely linked gravitationally and form a pair of [[interacting galaxies]]. This configuration is similar to that of a [[binary star]] system.

'''Scientific literature''' comprises scholarly [[publication]]s that report original [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] and [[theoretical]] work in the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, and within an academic field, often abbreviated as '''the literature'''.  [[Academic publishing]] is the process of contributing the results of one's [[research]] into the literature, which often requires a peer-review process. Original [[scientific research]] published for the first time in [[scientific journal]]s is called the [[primary literature]]. Patents and [[technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), can also be considered primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s include review articles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight advances and new lines of research) and [[book]]s (for large projects or broad arguments, including compilations of articles). [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption.

== Types of scientific publications ==

Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Öchsner|first=Andreas|title=Types of Scientific Publications|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|work=Introduction to Scientific Publishing|pages=9–21|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|isbn=9783642386459|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* scientific articles published in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]]
* [[Patent|patents]] specialized for science and technology (for example, [[Biological patent|biological patents]] and [[Chemical patent|chemical patents]])
* [[Book|books]] wholly written by one or a small number of co-[[Author|authors]]
* [[Edited volume|edited volumes]], where each [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] is the responsibility of a different author or set of authors, while the [[Editing|editor]] is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content
* presentations at [[Academic conference|academic conferences]], especially those organized by [[Learned society|learned societies]]
* [[government]] reports such as a [[forensic investigation]] conducted by a government agency such as the [[NTSB]]
* scientific publications on the [[World Wide Web]]
* books, [[Technical report|technical reports]], [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]], and [[Working paper|working papers]] issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organised into a series
* [[blogs]] and science forums

Literature may also be published in areas considered to be "[[Grey literature|grey]]", as they are published outside of traditional channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This material is traditionally not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ORgP4AwPtQC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=peer-reviewed+journal+articles+remain+the+predominant+publication+type,+and+have+the+highest+prestige.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ssTqWvQvWE&amp;sig=nLzMKCNc2qRGt3auPXHrH7TXh54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSwLGLpqLeAhXEzlMKHc9xDUcQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peer-reviewed%20journal%20articles%20remain%20the%20predominant%20publication%20type,%20and%20have%20the%20highest%20prestige.&amp;f=false|title=Ethics in Science and Engineering|last=Speight|first=James G.|last2=Foote|first2=Russell|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118104842|location=|pages=241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally books published by university presses are usually considered more prestigious than those published by commercial presses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The status of working papers and [[conference proceeding]]s depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the [[applied sciences]]. The value of publication as a [[preprint]] or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as [[mathematics]] or [[high energy physics]], it is now an accepted alternative.{{citationneeded|date=October 2018}}

=== Scientific papers and articles ===
There are ten different types of scientific papers. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peh|first=Wilfred|date=2008|title=Basic structure and types of scientific papers|url=|journal=Effective Medical Writing|volume=|pages=|via=Singapore Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers that carry specific objectives are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''The original article''' provides new information from original research usually supported by statistics.
* '''case reports''' are unique events that researchers look at to gain information on what they are researching.
* '''technical notes''' this is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective.
* '''[[pictorial essay]]''' are a series of images high in quality that's goal is to teach what the pictures are of.
* '''[[Review article|review]]''' is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic.
* '''commentary''' is a short summery of an author's personal experience.
* '''[[Editorial|editorials]]''' are short reviews or critiques of original articles.
* '''letters to the editor''', these are comments directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism.

These two have varying types of scientific classifications and can range from historical articles to speeches:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''other.''' Other types of papers not listed under non scientific material or any of the 8 above types of scientific publications are put into this category and vary depending on the objective and style of the article.
* '''nonscientific material.''' This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. it does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article.

===Preparation===
The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes.  Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or [[preprint]]s followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for [[scientific writing]] have to be followed.

===Language===
{{see also|Impact factor|Copy editing}} 

Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pan, Z|title=Crossing the language limitations|journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=3|pages=E410|year=2006|pmid=17002510|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030410|last2=Gao|first2=J|issue=9|pmc=1576334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many{{which|date=August 2018}} international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Structure and style===
{{main|IMRAD}}
A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, it is not the format that is important, but what lies behind it--the content. However, several key formatting requirements need to be met:

#The title attracts readers' attention and informs them about the contents of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon-Neuner|first=Elise|title=Titles in medical articles: What do we know about them?|journal=The Write Stuff|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=158–160|url=http://www.emwa.org/members/indevelopment/neuner.pd|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper's content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasilev|first=Martin|title=How to write a good title for journal articles|url=http://jeps.efpsa.org/blog/2012/09/01/how-to-write-a-good-title-for-journal-articles/|work=JEPS Bulletin|publisher=European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles.
#The names and affiliations of all authors are given. In the wake of some [[scientific misconduct]] cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#An [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish [[subject metadata]] for indexing services.
# The context of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an "Introduction".
# Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called "Materials and Methods", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects.
#Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called "Results", data should be presented in tabular or graphic form ([[image]], [[chart]], [[schematic]], [[diagram]] or [[drawing]]). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and discussed in the text of the article.
# Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a "Discussion" or "Conclusions" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound.  That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal [[appeal to authority|authority]], [[rhetoric|rhetorical skill]], or [[faith]].
# Finally, a "References" or "Literature Cited" section lists the sources cited by the authors.

== Peer review ==
{{main|Scholarly peer review}}
Though peer review and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they are both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of [[quality control]], a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal.

The "quality" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most [[technical report]]s and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality.

The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious.

Increasing reliance on [[Indexing and abstracting service|abstracting service]]s, especially on those available electronically, means that the effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].

==Ethics==
The transfer of [[copyright]] from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve [[facsimile]] [[reproduction]] unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In terms of research publications, a number of key issues include and are not restricted to:&lt;ref name="Chanson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Digital Publishing, Ethics and Hydraulic Engineering: The Elusive or "Boring" Bore?  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159099 |publisher=In: Stefano Pagliara 2nd International Junior Researcher and Engineer Workshop on Hydraulic Structures (IJREW'08), Pisa, Italy, Keynote, pp. 3-13, 30 July-1 August 2008 |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-8492-568-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Honesty. Honesty and integrity is a duty of each author and person, expert-reviewer and member of journal editorial boards.
* Review process. The peer-review process contributes to the quality control and it is an essential step to ascertain the standing and originality of the research.&lt;ref name="Chanson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Research Quality, Publications and Impact in Civil Engineering into the 21st Century.

** Human Welfare Concerns. The guidelines for human experimentation started during WWII with the Nuremberg Code. It has evolved into three main principles from The Belmont Report. The subject must be able to make their own choices to protect themselves, benefits must outweigh the risks, and subjects must be evaluated for their selection and benefits must go to all of society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
**Animal Welfare Concerns. Is the ethical care of animals in scientific experiments. The APS has set strict guidelines and regulations to stop animals from being unnecessarily harmed in experiments. These are being updated regularly by the APS and is a federal law in the United States enforced by DHHS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Authorship. Who may claim a right to authorship?&lt;ref name="Chanson2008" /&gt; In which order should the authors be listed?
**Conflicts of Interests. This is referring to the biased assumption due to private interest. It can be done knowingly or not. This is unethical because it makes data inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
**Authors Disputes. The authorship of an article is simply the author of the article. The ethical issue with this is when there are two people that believe to be the author, but there is only one true author. There are guidelines to help pick which get authorship of the writing. The one that does not get authorship is put in the acknowledgments. The guidelines come from NIH and The Council of Science Editors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11427">[[Surface tension]] is one of the areas of interest in [[biomimetics]] research. Surface tension forces will only begin to dominate gravitational forces below length scales on the order of the fluid's [[capillary length]], which for water is about 2 millimeters. Because of this scaling, biomimetic devices that utilize surface tension will generally be very small, however there are many ways in which such devices could be used.

[[File:Lotus Leaf (5780807820).jpg|thumb|Lotus Leaf (5780807820)]] [[File:Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure.jpg|thumb|Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure]]

A [[:File:Lotus Leaf (5780807820).jpg|lotus leaf]] is well known for its ability to repel water and self-clean. Yuan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuan|first1=Zhiqing|title=A novel fabrication of a superhydrophobic surface with highly similar hierarchical structure of the lotus leaf on a copper sheet|journal=Applied Surface Science|date=15 November 2013|volume= 285|pages=205–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues fabricated a negative mold of alotus leaf from [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) to capture the tiny [[:File:Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure.jpg|hierarchical structures]] integral for the leaf's ability to repel water, known as the [[lotus effect]]. The lotus leaf's surface was then replicated by allowing a copper sheet to flow into the negative mold with the assistance of [[Iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] and pressure. The result was a lotus leaf-like surface inherent on the copper sheet. Static water [[contact angle]] measurements of the biomimetic surface were taken to be 132° after etching the copper and 153° after a [[stearic acid]] surface treatment to mimic the lotus leaf's waxy coating. A surface that mimics the lotus leaf could have numerous applications by providing water repellent outdoor gear.

Various species of [[Salvinia natans|floating fern]] are able to sustain a liquid-solid barrier of air between the fern and the surrounding water when they are submerged. Like the lotus leaf, floating fern species have tiny hierarchical structures that prevent water from wetting the plant surface. Mayser and Barthlott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayser|first1=Matthias|title=Layers of Air in the Water beneath the Floating Fern Salvinia are Exposed to Fluctuations in Pressure|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=12 June 2014|volume= 56|issue= 5|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated this ability by submerging different species of the floating fern salvinia in water inside a pressure vessel to study how the air barrier between the leaf and surrounding water react to changes in pressure that would be similar to those experienced by the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of a ship. Much other research is ongoing using these hierarchical structures in coatings on ship hulls to reduce viscous [[Drag (physics)|drag]] effects.

=== Biomedical ===

[[File:Bronchial anatomy.jpg|thumb|Bronchial anatomy]]

A lung is composed of many small sacks called [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of the blood respectively as the blood is passed through small capillaries that surround these alveoli. Surface tension is exploited by alveoli by means of a [[surfactant]] that is produced by one of the cells and released to lower the surface tension of the fluid coating the inside of the alveoli to prevent these sacks from collapsing. Huh &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huh|first1=Dongeun|title=Reconstituting Organ-Level Lung Functions on a Chip|journal=Science|date=25 June 2010|volume= 328|issue= 5986|pages=1662–1668}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his fellow researchers created a lung mimic that replicated the function of native [[alveolar cells]]. An [[extracellular matrix]] of gel, human alveolar epithelial cells, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were cultured on a polydimethylsiloxane membrane that was bound in a flexible vacuum diaphragm. Pressurization cycles of the vacuum diaphragm, which simulated breathing, showed similar form and function to an actual lung. The type II cells were also shown to emit the same surfactant that lowered the surface tension of the fluid coating the lung mimic. This research will hopefully some day lead to the creation of lungs that could be grown for patients that need to have a transplant or repair performed.

[[File:20140427 130230 7250M.JPG|thumb|20140427 130230 7250M]]

[[Microvelia]] exploit surface tension by creating a surface tension gradient that propels them forward by releasing a surfactant behind them through a tongue-like protrusion. Biomimetic engineering was used in a creative and fun way to make and edible [[cocktail]] boat that mimicked the ability of microvelia to propel themselves on the surface of water by means of a phenomenon called the [[marangoni effect]].  Burton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=Lisa|title=The Cocktail Boat|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=22 May 2014|volume= 54|issue= 6|pages=969–973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her colleagues used [[3D printing]] to make small plastic boats that released different types of [[alcohol]] behind the boat to lower the surface tension and create a surface tension gradient that propelled each boat. This type of propulsion could one day be used to make sea vessels more efficient.

=== Actuators ===

[[File:Polypody (a fern) - the underside - geograph.org.uk - 974672.jpg|thumb|Polypody (a fern) - the underside - geograph.org.uk - 974672]] [[File:Image from page 395 of "The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)" (1918) (14598564448).jpg|thumb|Image from page 395 of "The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)" (1918) (14598564448)]]

Fern [[Sporangium|sporangia]] consist of hygroscopic ribs that protrude from a spine on the part of the plant that encapsulate spores in a sack ([[:File:Image from page 395 of "The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)" (1918) (14598564448).jpg|diagram]]). A [[Capillary bridges|capillary bridge]] is formed when water condenses on to the surface of these spines. When this water evaporates, surface tension forces between each rib cause the spine to retract and rip open the sack, spilling the spores. Borno &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borno|first1=Ruba|title=Transpiration actuation: the design, fabrication and characterization of biomimetic microactuators driven by the surface tension of water|journal=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering|date=21 September 2006|volume= 16|issue= 11|pages=2375–2383}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her fellow researchers fabricated a biomimetic device from polydimethylsiloxane using standard [[photolithography]] techniques. The devices used the same hygroscopic ribs and spine that resemble fern sporangia. The researchers varied the dimensions and spacing of the features of the device and were able to fine-tune and predict movements of the device as a whole in hopes of using a similar device as a microactuator that can perform functions using free energy from a humid atmosphere.

[[File:Leaf Beetle (Gastrophysa viridula) - male.jpg|thumb|Leaf Beetle (Gastrophysa viridula) - male]]

A [[leaf beetle]] has an incredible ability to adhere to dry surfaces by using numerous capillary bridges between the tiny hair-like [[seta]]e on its feet. Vogel and Steen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Michael|title=Capillarity-based switchable adhesion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=22 December 2009|volume= 107|issue= 8|pages=3377–3381}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted this and designed and constructed a switchable wet adhesion mechanism that mimics this ability. They used standard photolithography techniques to fabricate a switchable adhesion [[Robot end effector|gripper]] that used a pump driven by [[electro-osmosis]] to create many capillary bridges that would hold on to just about any surface. The leaf beetle can also reverse this effect by trapping air bubbles between its setae to walk on wet surfaces or under water. This effect was demonstrated by Hosoda and Gorb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hosoda|first1=N.|title=How a leaf beetle walks underwater|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120808132526.htm|website=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they constructed a biomimetic surface that could adhere objects to surfaces under water. Using this technology could help to create autonomous robots that would be able to explore treacherous terrain that is otherwise too dangerous to explore.

[[File:Water strider, from Kerala.JPG|thumb|Water strider, from Kerala]]

Various life forms found in nature exploit surface tension in different ways. Hu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=David|title=Water-walking devices|journal=Experimental Fluids|date=1 June 2007|volume= 43|issue= 5|pages=769–778}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues looked at a few examples to create devices that mimic the abilities of their natural counterparts to walk on water, jump off the liquid interface, and climb [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]]. Two such devices were a rendition of the [[Gerridae|water strider]]. Both devices mimicked the form and function of a water strider by incorporating a rowing motion of one pair of legs to propel the device, however one was powered with elastic energy and the other was powered by electrical energy. This research compared the various biomimetic devices to their natural counterparts by showing the difference between many physical and [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless parameters]]. This research could one day lead to small, energy efficient water walking robots that could be used to clean up spills in waterways.

=== Environment ===

[[File:Stenocara dentata.jpg|thumb|stenocara dentata]]

The [[Stenocara dentata|Stenocara beetle]], a native of the [[Namib Desert]] has a unique structure on its body that allows it to capture water from a humid atmosphere. In the Namib Desert, rain is not a very common occurrence, but on some mornings a dense fog will roll over the desert. The stenocara beetle uses tiny raised [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] spots on its hydrophobic body to collect water droplets from the fog. Once these droplets are large enough, they can detach from these spots and roll down the beetle's back and into its mouth. Garrod et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrod|first1=R.|title=Mimicking a Stenocara Beetle’s Back for Microcondensation Using Plasmachemical Patterned Superhydrophobic-Superhydrophilic Surfaces|journal=Langmuir|date=4 October 2006|volume= 23|issue= 2|pages=689–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated a biomimetic surface that was created using standard photolithography and plasma etching to create hydrophilic spots on a hydrophobic substrate for water collection. The optimal sizing and spacing of these spots that allowed the most water to be collected was similar to the spacing of the spots on the body of the stenocara beetle. Currently, this surface technology is being studied to implement as a coating on the inside of a water bottle the will allow the water bottle to self fill if left open in a humid environment, and could help to provide aid where water is scarce.

[[File: Synchro-ciné15.jpg | thumb | Delacommune reading desk and its visual result|250px|link=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Synchro-cin%C3%A915.jpg]]
The '''Synchro-Ciné''' was a device, invented by the [[French people|French]] inventor [[Charles Delacommune]] in 1921, pioneer in the objective of synchronizing the [[Movie projector|projection]] of a [[film]] with the corresponding sounds. The sounds to be synchronized could be from the words of a narrator, the reading of a [[Full score|score]] by an [[orchestra conductor]] (or by a musician [[solo (music)|solo]]ist), or ''shooting up'' devices with noises-effects;.&lt;ref name="Patent1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Delacommune |first=Charles Eugene|title=Dispositif a sychroniser divers appareils avec la projection des vues animées |publisher=Canadian Patent Document|year=1925|pages=CIPO 247024.24/02/1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; But always by mechanical procedures, and with live sound by interpreters in the room (it was still a decade away for sound cinema). It was also known as Ciné-desk (Ciné-pupitre) in certain countries.

But in reality, under the same name are called, over time, three different things:

A) Firstly, the original synchronized reading desk, 1921, namely, an isolated device for reading texts or music, for a single user (although this may be an orchestra conductor who, since reading it, controls the complete template of instrumentalists) adjusted by an engine in synchronization with the projected images of the films.

B) Soon after, in 1922-23, the synchro-ciné is now becoming a complete synchronization system, in which the reading desk is only one of the many elements around another central device, the ''[[control flow|control]] [[bandage|band]]'', which can automatically trigger various 'noise' devices ''(Ciné-bruiteurs)'' or 'noise-makers' (also designed and incorporated into the system in the patent), shoot [[piano]] [[player piano|players]], [[Phonograph|gramophone]]s, and various desks that are needed, up to a maximum of, it seems, 9 devices. The proof of the change of orientation in the machinery and final objectives is the fact that, although the reading desks remain a regular part of the system; however it is already perfectly possible to perform a [[performance]] without using, at all, the reading desks (only with the capacity of the central [[distributor]], and the connected sound devices). They also form part of the system the various procedures and methods that it registers to improve and facilitate the use of its synchronization system (the ''Delacommune system''), over time.

And c) later, it gave name to a [[Film distributor|production]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]] [[company]] of the films realized with this device (and directed by the own Delacommune).&lt;ref name= "Database"&gt;{{cite web |surname=IMDb Database|title=Productora/Distribuidora Synchro-Ciné |url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0026234/|publisher=Consultado el 24/02/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, "''ElDorado''", by L'Herbier; the "''Danse Macabre''" by Dudley Murphy or the [[Ballet mécanique]], by Léger.&lt;ref name="synchrocine"&gt;{{cite web |surname=Ortiz Morales, J.M | title=El ballet mécanique y el Synchro-Ciné|url=http://ortizmorales.info/Publicaciones/Le_Ballet_Mecanique_y_el_Synchrocine.pdf |year=2008|publisher=Tesina COM/CAP.UMA2008. RPI: 2009/99900744172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a trajectory based on documentaries, this production company had a moment of boom at the beginning of [[sound cinema]].&lt;ref name="Devaux"&gt;{{Citation|last=Devaux |first=Pierre|title=Le dubbing ou traduction des films étranger |publisher=Ed.Masson et Cie.

However, Delacommune (and his company) it ended up falling into ruin and had to be subject to a special campaign of help by his fellow inventors for their mere subsistence.&lt;ref name = "CDelacommune"&gt;{{cite web |surname=Ortiz Morales, J.M | title=El Synchro-Ciné de Charles Delacommune|url=http://ortizmorales.info/Publicaciones/El_synchrocine_de_Charles_Delacommune.pdf |year=2012|publisher=Thesis COM/CAP.UMA2012.Reg: 2012/00200020399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 1921 device consisted of a reading device supplied with an aperture at which a [[paper]] text ''"that unfolded before the reader, by small shakes, on which was inscribed the oral accompaniment of the film. Each line corresponded to the projection time of a number of determined [s] and was in the center of the reference during the projection of these frames. In other words, the fixed reference allowed the reader to know in each instant the phrase of the text to say corresponding to the projection or the conductor of the appropriate musical fragment"'', say Delacommune himself in his patent.&lt;ref name="CDelacommune" /&gt;

Once the paper-band was prepared, the various mismatches common to the time from multiple causes (lack of electrical current, mechanical problems, etc.) could be solved, on the fly, in two ways. Or the speed of the control band was set at the desk ( or the ''[[distributor]]'') or by a [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] that the [[orchestra conductor]] was placed in the hand, slightly vary the speed of the images.&lt;ref name="CDelacommune" /&gt;

But this system also had the potential to work in another way: firing directly from its paper-band orders to the various [[Musical note|note]]s of a [[pianola]], or shooting up effects and devices of noises or records previously prepared for this purpose. It is this potentiality of automatic adjustment (once the control-band is properly recorded) that makes it a mechanical precedent to the current audiovisual mixes tables,and, perhaps, of the [[MIDI]] systems ( the [[digital data|digital]] [[control flow|control]] of [[music]]al [[Musical instrument|instrument]]s).&lt;ref name="synchrocine" /&gt;

It was not the only device of the so-called ''synchronization desks'' or '' synchronized reading '' of the time, an advance that the film industry of the moment was looking forward to, as it offered movies with live music, including large symphony orchestras in the ''first class'' halls (Cinema-Palaces) or Theater-Cinemas.

Delacommune himself says in the magazines of the time: "''One immediately understands the interest of such an apparatus. Of a little expensive manufacture, with a safe operation, its use is very indicated in all the places where the words must accompany a projection. One can foresee the happy consequences in teaching, in filmed lectures, in innovations (theater-filmed, novel-movies spoken, et cetera)''.

Shortly after, the German industry counted with the [[Musikchronometer]], of [[Carl Blum]] for the same thing, an analog device although with different mechanism,&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;{{Citation|last=Blum |first=Carl Robert|title=Verfahren zum Synchronisieren von kinematographischen Reihenbildern mit zugehoerigenTonfolgen auf drahtlosem Wege |publisher=EC: DE602246 (C).

In [[telecommunication]]s and related engineering (including [[computer networking]] and [[Computer programming|programming]]), the term '''timeout''' or '''time-out''' has several meanings, including:

* A [[telecommunications network|network]] parameter related to an enforced [[Event-driven programming|event]] designed to occur at the conclusion of a predetermined elapsed [[time]].  
* A specified period of time that will be allowed to elapse in a [[system]] before a specified event is to take place, unless another specified event occurs first; in either case, the period is terminated when either event takes place.  Note:  A timeout condition can be canceled by the receipt of an appropriate time-out cancellation [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]]. 
* An event that occurs at the end of a predetermined period of time that began at the occurrence of another specified event. The timeout can be prevented by an appropriate signal.

Timeouts allow for more efficient usage of limited resources without requiring additional interaction from the agent interested in the goods that cause the consumption of these resources. The basic idea is that in situations where a system must wait for something to happen, rather than waiting indefinitely, the waiting will be aborted after the timeout period has elapsed. This is based on the assumption that further waiting is useless, and some other action is necessary.

Other examples are
* In [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] connections, the server will usually close a client connection after a certain period of inactivity (the timeout period).  This ensures that connections do not persist forever, if the client crashes or the network goes down.  Open connections consume resources, and may prevent other clients from accessing the same mailbox.
* In [[HTTP persistent connections]], the web server saves opened connections (which consume [[CPU time]] and [[computer memory|memory]]). The web client does not have to send an "end of requests series" signal.  Connections are closed (timed out) after five minutes of inactivity; this ensures that the connections do not persist indefinitely.
* In a timed light switch, both [[energy]] and lamp's [[life-span]] are saved. The user does not have to switch off manually.
* [[Tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s commonly turn off their [[backlight]] after a certain time without user input.
* In an electronic text-based [[customer relationship management]] software tool, the threads can be auto-closed in a timed base, allowing the workers save browse time. The customer does not have to send an "I'm done" signal.

'''Women's colleges in the United States''' are [[Single-sex education|single-sex]] [[higher education in the United States|U.S. institutions of higher education]] that only admit female students. They are often [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]. There were approximately 34 active [[women's colleges]] in the United States in the fall of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/12/09/college-new-rochelle-goes-completely-coed|title=College of New Rochelle Goes Completely Coed - Inside Higher Ed|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Saint Joseph went coeducational at the undergraduate level in the fall of 2018.

{{Education in the U.S.}}

Education for girls and women was originally provided within the family, by locals dame schools and public elementary schools, and at female seminaries found in every colony, but limited to young ladies from families with the means to pay tuition and, arguably, still more limited by the focus on providing ladylike accomplishments rather than academic training. These seminaries or academies were usually small and often ephemeral, usually established founded by a single woman or small group of women, they often failed to outlive their founders. In evaluating the many claims of various colleges to have been the "first" women's college, it is necessary to understand that a number of these 18th- or early 19th-century female seminaries later grew into academic, degree-granting colleges, while others became notable private high schools. However, to have been a female seminary at an early date is not the same thing as to have been a women's college at that date. [[Wesleyan College]], chartered in 1836 as a full college for women that could grant degrees equivalent to those men were receiving at the time, was the first true "women's college" in the United States.

Institutions of higher education for women, however, were primarily founded during the early 19th century, many as [[Seminary#Teaching seminaries|teaching seminaries]]. As noted by the [[Women's College Coalition]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal education of girls and women began in the middle of the 19th century and was intimately tied to the conception that society had of the appropriate role for women to assume in life. Republican education prepared girls for their future role as wives and mothers and taught religion, singing, dancing, literature, etcetera. Academic education prepared girls for their role as community leaders and social benefactors and had some elements of the education offered boys. Seminaries educated women for the only socially acceptable occupation: teaching. Only unmarried women could be teachers. Many early women's colleges began as female seminaries and were responsible for producing an important corps of educators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.womenscolleges.org/history/default.htm The Rise of Women's Colleges, Coeducation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516112824/http://www.womenscolleges.org/history/default.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra further note that, "women's colleges were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |title=Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges |first=Irene |last=Harwarth |publisher=ed.gov |accessdate=October 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204110037/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archivedate=February 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early proponents of education for women were [[Sarah Pierce]] ([[Litchfield Female Academy]], 1792); [[Catharine Beecher]] ([[Hartford Female Seminary]], 1823); [[Zilpah P. Grant Banister]] ([[Ipswich Female Seminary]], 1828); and [[Mary Lyon]]. Lyon was involved in the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of ''Wheaton Female Seminary'' (now [[Wheaton College, Massachusetts]]) in 1834; it was re-chartered as a college in 1912. In 1837, Lyon founded ''Mount Holyoke Female Seminary'' ([[Mount Holyoke College]]), it was chartered as a college in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/index.shtml |title=About Mount Holyoke |publisher=mountholyoke.edu |accessdate=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harwarth, Maline, and DeBra note that, "Mount Holyoke’s significance is that it became a model for a multitude of other women’s colleges throughout the country.".&lt;ref name="Harwarth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |title=Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges |author=Irene Harwarth |author2=Mindi Maline |author3=Elizabeth DeBra |publisher=U.S. Department of Education National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204110037/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archivedate=February 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Vassar College]] and [[Wellesley College]] were patterned after Mount Holyoke.&lt;ref name="Crispen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dean.sbc.edu/crispen.html|title=Seven Sisters and a Country Cousin |author=Jennifer L. Crispen |publisher=sbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wesleyan College]] in Macon, Georgia was the first college chartered for women, receiving its charter in 1836. Vassar College was the first of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] to be chartered as a college in 1861. In 1840, the first Catholic women's college [[Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College]] was founded by [[Saint Mother Theodore Guerin]] of the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods|Sisters of Providence]] in Indiana as an academy, later becoming the college. The college became co-educational in 2015.

[[File:Vassar College ca 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vassar College]] in 1862]]

Some early women's colleges, such as [[Oread Institute]] chartered as a college for women in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] 1849, and the Baltimore Female College, also founded 1849 at [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|St. Paul Street]] and East Saratoga Street in downtown [[History of Baltimore|Baltimore]], later relocating to Park Avenue/Park Place and Wilson Street in the [[Bolton Hill, Baltimore|Bolton Hill]] neighborhood under its longtime president [[Nathan C. Brooks|Dr. Nathan C. Brooks]], (1809-1898), a noted classics scholar (until closing in the late 1880s), however failed to survive.

[[File:Agnes Scott College - Buttrick Hall.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Agnes Scott College]] ]]

Another early women's school was the [[Moravian College]], founded as a female seminary in 1742 in [[Germantown, Connecticut|Germantown]] and later moved to [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] it was originally called the ''Bethlehem Female Seminary''. It began to grant undergraduate degrees in 1863 and became the ''Moravian Seminary and College for Women'' in 1913. In 1954, it combined with the boys school, ''Moravian College and Theological Seminary'' and became coeducational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moravian.edu/about/history.htm |title=Looking for something? |publisher=Moravian.edu |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009153351/http://www.moravian.edu/about/history.htm |archivedate=October 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moravians of Salem, North Carolina began what is now [[Salem College]] in 1772 in [[Winston-Salem]].

While there were a few [[coeducational]] colleges (such as [[Oberlin College]] founded in 1833, [[Guilford College]], in 1837, [[Lawrence University]] in 1847, [[Antioch College]] in 1853, and [[Bates College]] in 1855), almost all colleges and universities at that time were exclusively for men. The first generally accepted coordinate college, [[H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College]], (with [[Tulane University]]), was founded in 1886, and followed a year later by [[Evelyn College for Women]], the coordinate college for [[Princeton University]]. The model was quickly duplicated at other prestigious universities. Notable 19th-century coordinate colleges included [[Barnard College|Barnard]] (with [[Columbia University]]), [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke]] (with [[Brown University]]), and [[Radcliffe College]] (with [[Harvard University]]). Twentieth-century examples include William Smith College (coordinate with Hobart College) and Kirkland College associated with Hamilton College. (The latter no longer exists as a stand-alone institution.)

While the majority of women's colleges are private institutions, there were a few [[Public university|public]] colleges. In 1884 the legislature of the state of [[Mississippi]] established [[Mississippi University for Women|Industrial Institute &amp; College]], (later [[Mississippi University for Women]]) the first [[Public university|public college]] for women in the United States. Other states soon followed: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] created [[Georgia College &amp; State University|Georgia State College for Women]] in 1889, [[North Carolina]] created [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro|North Carolina Women's College]] in 1891, and Florida converted its coeducational [[Florida State University|Florida State College]] to a women-only school in 1905. This is similar to the establishment of [[Douglass Residential College (Rutgers University)]], which was founded as the ''New Jersey College for Women in 1918'' by [[Mabel Smith Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, &amp; Challenges |last=Harwarth |first=Irene |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |year=1997 |place=Darby, PA |publisher=Diane |edition= |id= |isbn=0-7881-4324-7 |url= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional types of women's colleges include the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sister colleges]] in the Northern United States, [[Women's colleges in the Southern United States#Historically black colleges|historically black female educational institutions]], small Catholic women’s colleges in the United States (SCWCs), and [[women's colleges in the Southern United States]].

==20th-century history==

===World War II===
Early in 1942, during World War II, debate arose concerning the role of colleges and students during the War. The [[Selective Service]] age had been lowered to 18 and a few questions arose: which men would go to college, which ones into the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Navy]], or the [[U.S. Coast Guard]], how the college students would be trained, and whether the colleges would be run by the military organizations or by educators?

The status of women and women's colleges also entered into the debate: "Urging a National Service Act for women, the American Council on Education's President George Zook said: 'It is clear that women students cannot expect to pursue college as usual while their brothers and male friends are rushed off ... Courses for women are going to be shortened and they are going to be directed toward preparation for specific types of war service. ... These War jobs are going to appear to college women to be hard and distasteful. Stronger words could be used for what many of the men are going through'."&lt;ref name=WWII&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,850198,00.html?promoid=googlep |title=Who Will Run the Colleges? |authorlink= |work=TIME |date=October 26, 1942 |accessdate=August 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's College Coalition===
The [[Women's College Coalition]] (WCC) was founded in 1979 and describes itself as an "association of women's colleges and universities – public and private, independent and church-related, two- and four-year – in the United States and Canada whose primary mission is the education and advancement of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenscolleges.org/about/wcc |title=Women's College Coalition: About Us |publisher=Womenscolleges.org |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222060824/http://www.womenscolleges.org/about/wcc |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coeducation===
{{See also|Mixed-sex education}}
[[File:Smith College.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Smith College]] ]]

With several [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases in the 1950s on the appellate court level determining that public single-sex universities violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution, many women's colleges have decided to accept males. Two of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sister colleges]] made transitions during and after the 1960s. The first, [[Radcliffe College]], merged with [[Harvard University]]. Beginning in 1963, students at Radcliffe received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard and joint commencement exercises began in 1970. The same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students experimentally and in 1972 full co-residence was instituted. The departments of [[College athletics|athletics]] of both schools merged shortly thereafter. In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe signed an agreement that put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. In 1999 Radcliffe College was dissolved and Harvard University assumed full responsibility over the affairs of female undergraduates. Radcliffe is now the ''Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study'' in [[women's studies|Women's Studies]] at Harvard University. The second, [[Vassar College]], declined an offer to merge with [[Yale University]] and instead became coeducational in 1969. The remaining [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] decided against coeducation. [[Mount Holyoke College]] engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of [[David Truman]] over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, "after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women's college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml |title=Mount Holyoke: A Detailed History|publisher=mtholyoke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smith College]] also made a similar decision in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smith.edu/collegerelations/presidents.php |title=Smith Tradition |publisher=smith.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101215838/http://www.smith.edu/collegerelations/presidents.php |archivedate=January 1, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, [[Bryn Mawr College]] and [[Haverford College]] (then all-male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibly of coeducation as well, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/history.shtml |title=A Brief history of Bryn Mawr College |publisher=brynmawr.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120065225/http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/history.shtml |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Columbia University]] began admitting women after a decade of failed negotiations with [[Barnard College]] for a merger along the lines of Harvard and Radcliffe (Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900, but it continues to be independently governed). [[Wellesley College]] also decided against coeducation during this time.

A few [[Women's colleges in the Southern United States#Historically black colleges|historically black women's colleges]] became coeducational: [[Barber-Scotia College]] adopted coeducation in 1954; Tillotson College (a women's college from 1926 to 1935) is now coeducational [[Huston-Tillotson University]]; Hartshorn Memorial College merged with [[Virginia Union University]] in 1932; and Mary Allen Seminary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbm08 |title=Mary Allen Seminary |publisher=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; became coeducational in 1933. [[Bennett College]], founded as a coeducational school, became a women's college in 1926.

Many public women's schools also went coeducational in the postwar era. One of the first schools to make the transition in this era was Madison College in Virginia, known since 1976 as [[James Madison University]]. The school, founded as a women's college in 1908, admitted its first male day students in 1946, although it was not officially recognized as a coeducational institution until 1966. In 1947, Florida State College for Women returned to its original status as a coeducational institution and adopted its current name of [[Florida State University]]. Three other public women's schools in Virginia later followed Madison College in adopting coeducation—Mary Washington College, now the [[University of Mary Washington]], in 1970; Radford College, now [[Radford University]], in 1972; and Longwood College, now [[Longwood University]], in 1976. In [[North Carolina]], the Women's College of the University of North Carolina was converted to the coeducational [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] in 1963, at the same time as women were finally admitted to all programs of its rival school, the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. In 1967, the school then known as the Women's College of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became coeducational; it is now [[Georgia College &amp; State University]].
[[File:Mills Hall Horizontal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mills College]]]]
[[Mississippi University for Women]] changed its [[College admissions in the United States|single-sex admissions policy]] to [[coeducation|include men]] in 1982 following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]''. The court found that the university would violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause]] if it denied admission to its nursing program on the basis of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihl.state.ms.us/universities.html |title=Mississippi IHL – Mississippi's Universities |publisher=Ihl.state.ms.us |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5-4 opinion was written by [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]], who stated that "In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened." She argued that there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses, and that denying admission to men "lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy."&lt;ref&gt;"[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]", 458 U.S. 718 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling did not require the university to change its name to reflect its coeducational status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muw.edu/pie/vision.html |title=MUW – Planning and Institutional Effectiveness |publisher=Muw.edu |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017083159/http://www.muw.edu/pie/vision.html |archivedate=October 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Texas Woman's University]] allowed men to its health science graduate school.  In 1994, the university opened all programs to male students. Despite the university accepting male students, the university's mission is still to serve primarily women.  Today, the student body is approximately 90% female and is led by a woman chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twu.edu/administration/brief-history-of-twu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104192220/http://www.twu.edu/administration/brief-history-of-twu/ |archivedate=November 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 1990, the Trustees of [[Mills College]] announced that they had voted to admit male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30610F73C540C778CDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Venerable School for Women Is Going Co-ed |publisher=nytimes.com |date=May 4, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision led to a two-week student and staff strike, accompanied by numerous displays of [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] protests by the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DE1738F936A35756C0A966958260 |title=Mills Students Protesting Admission of Men |publisher=nytimes.com |date=May 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616FC355E0C758CDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Disbelieving and Defiant, Students Vow: No Men |first=Katherine |last=Bishop |publisher=nytimes.com |date=May 6, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, nearly 300 students blockaded the administrative offices and boycotted classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DE133EF93BA35756C0A966958260 |title=Protest Continues at College Over Decision to Admit Men |publisher=nytimes.com |date=May 8, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, the Trustees met again to reconsider the decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DA1130F931A25756C0A966958260 |title=College to Reconsider Decision to Admit Men |publisher=nytimes.com |date=May 12, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading finally to a reversal of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616F63C550C7A8DDDAC0894D8494D81 |first=Katherine |last=Bishop |title=Women's College Rescinds Its Decision to Admit Men |publisher=nytimes.com |date=May 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st-century history==
The trend toward coeducation continued in the 21st century. [[Notre Dame College]] in Ohio admitted its first men in 2001. In Pennsylvania, [[Seton Hill University]] went coeducational in 2002, and [[Chestnut Hill College]], which had established a coeducational graduate program in 1980, admitted its first male undergraduates in 2003.

Beginning in late 2004 the debate concerning [[coeducation]] resurfaced when, citing decreased enrollment, [[Wells College]] announced that it would adopt coeducation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wells.edu/whatsnew/wnnwar50.htm#trustees |title=Wells College – News |author=Wells College Computer Services |publisher=Wells.edu |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, there were student protests on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2004/10/01/news/news01.txt |title=Trustees greeted by angry students |last=Tarby |first=Russ |publisher=AuburnPub.com |date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2004/10/03/news/news02.txt |title=Students stage sit-in to protest |last=Spohr |first=George |publisher=AuburnPub.com |date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2004/10/10/news/news03.txt |title=Wells students not going home |last=Barton |first=Noelle |publisher=AuburnPub.com |date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of students also became involved in the protests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2004/10/11/news/news03.txt |title=Angered Wells parents feel left out |last=Barton |first=Noelle |publisher=AuburnPub.com |date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did many alumnae. Some of the students stated that their protests were patterned after those at [[Mills College]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2004/10/04/news/news02.txt |title=Wells students' sit-in patterned after Mills |last=Spohr |first=George |publisher=AuburnPub.com |date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website called ''Wells for Women'' was also established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/wellscollegepetition/ |title=Wells for Women |accessdate=August 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027060419/http://geocities.com/wellscollegepetition/ |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the decision to adopt coeducation was approved, students filed a lawsuit that was eventually rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/wellscollege.asp |title=When Wells Run Dry: Another women's college opens the door to men |last=Wogan |first=Lisa |publisher=Ms. Magazine |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells became coeducational in 2005.

A few other colleges became coeducational in this period. [[Immaculata University]] and [[Lesley College]] also announced that they would adopt coeducation around this time and became coeducational in 2005. In 2006, [[H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College]] was dissolved as part of the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (it is now a part of [[Tulane University]]). In 2007, [[Douglass Residential College (Rutgers University)|Douglass College]] of [[Rutgers University]] merged with the coed [[Rutgers College]], changing its name to the ''Douglass Residential College.'' While a part of Rutgers, it will offer dormitories and classes exclusively for women. [[Regis College, Massachusetts|Regis College]] became coeducational in 2007.

Debate increased when [[Randolph College|Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] announced that it would adopt coeducation and change its name. Former Interim president Ginger H. Worden argued (in a September 17, 2006 editorial for the ''[[Washington Post]]'') that it was not economically feasible for the college to remain single-sex as young women are no longer interested in attending women's colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/15/AR2006091500939_pf.html |title=Why We Had No Choice but to Go Coed |first=Virginia |last=Worden |publisher=washingtonpost.edu |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=October 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a number of presidents of women's colleges challenged Worden's article, arguing that other women's colleges are still doing well and attracting students.

A similar controversy erupted in 2011 when [[Peace College]], in Raleigh, NC, announced its plans to become coeducational beginning the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/07/21/1360385/peace-college-going-coed-changing.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090100/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/07/21/1360385/peace-college-going-coed-changing.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |title=Peace College going coed, changing its name |publisher=newsobserver.com |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite protests from alumnae, William Peace University began admitting men in the fall of 2012. Also in fall 2012, [[Georgian Court University]] in New Jersey admitted its first male day students; in 2013–14, that school became fully coeducational, with men being allowed to live on campus and participate in all campus activities.

The most recent women's college to become fully coed was [[Midway University]] in Kentucky, which announced in May 2016 that it would admit men into its daytime undergraduate program, the last component of the institution that remained women-only, effective that August. In announcing the move, the school's president noted that many surveys indicated that only 2% of high school girls wanted to attend a women-only school, and added, "We see this change as strengthening our historic mission to educate women by broadening our reach to that 98 percent of young women who would never consider a women’s college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.midway.edu/2016/05/16/midway-university-trustees-vote-accept-men-daytime-undergraduate-programs/ |title=Midway University Trustees vote to accept men into its daytime undergraduate programs |publisher=Midway University |date=May 16, 2016 |accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of women's colleges have taken steps to adopt [[Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges|policies inclusive of transgender students]].
