      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5725">'''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering''' was a series of performances from October 13–23, 1966, where artists and engineers from [[Bell Laboratories]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] collaborated on what was to be the first event in a series of projects that would become known as [[E.A.T.]] or [[E.A.T.|Experiments in Art and Technology]]. 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering was conjured up by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/0204/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally intended to be presented as part of the [[Stockholm]] Festival of Art and Technology in 1966. But when the festival's negotiations fell through, [[Billy Klüver]] and the whole group moved the event to the [[69th Regiment Armory]] and called it ''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering.''&lt;ref name = "getty"&gt;[http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/940003/940003.xml;chunk.id=ref15;brand=default]&lt;/ref&gt; The participants consisted of 10 artists and some 30 engineers to create a blend of avant-garde theatre, dance and new technologies.

9 Evenings was the first large-scale collaboration between artists and engineers and scientists. The two groups worked together for 10 months to develop technical equipment and systems that were used as an integral part of the artists’ performances. Their collaboration produced many "firsts" in the use of new technology for the theater, both with specially-designed systems and equipment and with innovative use of existing equipment. [[Closed-circuit television]] and [[television]] projection was used on stage for the first time; a [[fiber-optics]] camera picked up objects in a performer's pocket; an [[infrared]] [[television camera]] captured action in total darkness; a [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] sonar device translated movement into sound; and portable wireless FM transmitters and amplifiers transmitted speech and body sounds to Armory loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9evenings.org/ 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Allegory of Prudence''''' (c. 1565–1570) is an [[oil painting]] attributed to the Italian artist [[Titian]] and his assistants. It is in the [[National Gallery, London]].

The painting portrays three human heads, each facing in a different direction, above three animal heads, depicting (from left) a wolf, a lion and a dog. The painting is usually interpreted as operating on a number of levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] and [[Fritz Saxl]], “A Late -Antique Religious Symbol in Works by Holbein and Titian”, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, XLIX (1926), 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 236 to 242&lt;/ref&gt; At the first level, the different ages of the three human heads represent the "Three Ages of Man" (youth, maturity, old age). The different directions in which they are facing reflect a second, wider concept of Time itself as having a past, present and future. This theme is repeated in the animal heads which, according to some traditions, are associated with those categories of time. The third level, from which the painting has acquired its present name, is suggested by a barely visible inscription, ''EX PRAETERITO/PRAESENS PRUDENTER AGIT/NE FUTURA ACTIONẼ DETURPET'' (“From the experience of the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoil future actions”).

It may also be that the human faces are actual portraits of the aged Titian, his son Orazio, and a young cousin, Marco Vecellio, who, like Orazio, lived and worked with Titian.&lt;ref&gt;''Titian's "''Allegory of Prudence''", A Postscript'', in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'', University Press, 1982 edn&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]], in his classic exposition, suggests that the painting is specifically associated with the negotiations associated with the passing on of Titian’s property to the younger generations, in the light of his approaching death. So, the painting acts as a visual counsel to the three generations to act prudently in the administration of the inheritance.  But [[Nicholas Penny]] is highly sceptical of this, and points out discrepancies between the human heads and other evidence of the appearance of the individuals.  He doubts it was a personal project of any sort and feels that is "surely more likely that the painting was commissioned".&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the painting has been explained in quite different ways. Instead of an allegory of prudence, it has been seen as an allegory about sin and penitence. On this view, it amounts to an admission by Titian that his failure to act prudently in his youth and middle age has condemned him to lead a regretful old age.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Cohen, “Titian's London Allegory and the three beasts of his selva oscura”, Renaissance Studies, 2000 (Vol 14, No 1) p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other extreme, the painting has been explained as asserting that the prudence which comes with experience and old age is an essential aspect of artistic discrimination and judgement. On this interpretation, the painting therefore acts as a rebuttal of the view that old age is the enemy of artistic achievement. On a more general level, the painting’s depiction of Titian with his assistants Orazio and Marco is also intended as a defence of the prudence of the continuity of the Venetian workshop tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Erin J Campbell, “Old Age and the Politics of Judgment in Titian’s allegory of prudence”, Word and Image: A Journal of Verbal/Visual Poetry, Vol 19 iss 4 2003, p 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, "Titian, Prudence and the three-headed beast", Journal of Art in Society, http://www.artinsociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Watercolour Institute''' (AWI) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to the advancement of [[watercolour painting]] in [[Australia]]. It was founded in 1923 by six painters in [[Sydney]], and was modeled after the [[Royal Watercolour Society]] and the [[American Watercolor Society]].

==History==
The AWI's first exhibition occurred in 1924. A students' exhibition began in 1930. Until 1974, the AWI met in a variety of places and the annual exhibitions were held in different galleries. In that year, it received a grant enabling the AWI to rent space in a building on Sydney's Sussex Street. A reciprocal exhibition with the American Watercolor Society occurred in 1975, and in 1977, an AWI exhibition toured New Zealand. The international presence expanded to include Mexico City, Mexico; Spain; Vancouver, Canada; Hong Kong; and Korea (4th Asian Grand Watercolour Festival, Busan Biennale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awi.com.au/AWI%20HISTORY%201..htm |title=AWI History |work=awi.com.au |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003084821/http://www.awi.com.au/AWI%20HISTORY%201..htm |archivedate=3 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding members were J. Bennett, [[Alfred James Daplyn]], [[Albert Henry Fullwood]], [[Benjamin Edwin Minns]], [[Martin Stainforth]] and Charles Ephraim Smith Tindall. Invited foundation members included [[Albert Collins (painter)|Albert Collins]], John Eldershaw, [[Hans Heysen]], [[Norman Lindsay]], [[Sydney Long]], [[Arthur Streeton]], John D Moore, [[J. W. Tristram]] and [[Blamire Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/media/index.php?id=283 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919083127/http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/media/index.php?id=283 |archivedate=2009-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past presidents include [[George Duncan (painter)|George Duncan]] and [[Hal Missingham]]. Other notable members include [[Ronald Steuart]], winner of the 1958 [[Wynne Prize]], and [[Robert Wade (watercolor artist)|Robert Wade]], winner of the 1986 "Advance Australia Medal" for outstanding contribution to Australian watercolour.&lt;ref name="FeaturedArtists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watlingart.com/artists_information.php?ID=8 |title=Featured Artists |work=watlingart.com |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605235055/http://www.watlingart.com/artists_information.php?ID=8 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While membership was by invitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnect.com.au/troupes/australianwatercolourinstitute.htm |title=Australian Watercolour Institute - AWI |work=artsconnect.com.au |accessdate=20 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007102843/http://www.artsconnect.com.au/troupes/australianwatercolourinstitute.htm |archivedate=7 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not a requirement for exhibiting at the annual exhibition, such as the example of Heysen.&lt;ref name="HansHeysen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hylton|first=Jane |author2=John Neylon|title=Hans Heysen: Into the Light |publisher=Wakefield Press|year=2005 |series=Carrick Hill series|pages=17|isbn=1-86254-657-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTfexysnFAIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Australian+Watercolour+Institute%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=e2imS-_IIYrAsgP1-aS9BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Australian%20Watercolour%20Institute%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Isherwood]]'s first exhibited work with the AWI. in 1934. was a small painting, but thereafter, she became a frequent exhibitor in major art exhibitions. In 2006, ten percent of the membership were recipients of honours awarded by the Australian state ([[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia|Australia Honours]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/media/index.php?id=102 |title=Australia's eminent watercolourists launch their major anniversary exhibition &amp; book |date=23 November 2006 |work=mosman.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919062926/http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/media/index.php?id=102 |archivedate=19 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
AWI published its first book, ''Australian Watercolour Institute: 75th anniversary 1923-1998'' on the occasion of its 75th anniversary in 1998. Its second book, ''The Australian Watercolour Institute: A Galley of Australia's Finest Watercolours'', was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/events/1368/AWI-85th-annual-exhibition|title=Australian Watercolour Institute 85th Anniversary Exhibition|work=mosman.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 edition reproduces over 150 contemporary Australian watercolour works, as well as forty historical ones, and includes essays that document Australia's watercolouring history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bunbury.wa.gov.au/library/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=125E7533Q9031.73900&amp;profile=bun&amp;uri=link=3100012~!108692~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=subtab52&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;term=Watercolorists+--+Australia.&amp;index=PSUBJ |title=The Australian Watercolour Institute / Peter Pinson, Jean Campbell and Peter Laverty ; foreword by Hendrik Kolenberg. |last=Pinson |first=Peter |year=2006 |work=bunbury.wa.gov.au |publisher=Phillip Mathews Book Publishers |accessdate=21 March 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10705">'''Budget albums''' (also known as '''drugstore records''' or, then, '''junk records''') were low-priced vinyl  LPs of [[pop music|popular]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music released during the 1950s to 1970s consisting either of previously released material (usually the releases from major labels featuring older performances of well-known performers) or material recorded especially for the line (often [[cover versions]] of popular songs made famous by name artists sung or performed on these albums by usually unidentified and unknown entertainers). Prices ranged from as low as 59 U.S. cents (minor label releases of the 1950s) to $2.98 (major label repackaging of older material in the 1970s). In the UK [[Pickwick Records]]' [[Top of the Pops (record series)|''Top of the Pops'']] record series, which operated between 1968 and 1985, was the most successful budget album range.

==Drugstore debut==
Discount stores (as well as Department stores) have had records produced by them by various record producing companies since the 1910s.  It was fashionable for a chain like McCrory's or Kress to have their own exclusive label.  Most of these records contained songs also available on many other 'exclusive' labels. (For example from the 1920s into the 1930s, Paramount produced the 'Broadway' label for Montgomery Ward, Cameo produced the 'Romeo' label for Kress, Columbia produced the 'Diva' label for W.T. Grant, and Plaza produced the 'Oriole' label for McCrory's, among many others.)

'''Drugstore records''' were called such as they were often sold in metal racks similar to the racks used for [[paperback]] books in [[Pharmacy|drugstores]] or [[Variety store|dimestores]] in the 1960s for prices from half to a quarter of regular [[LP album]]s. These records were markedly less expensive than major label recordings.

The initial "drugstore records" mostly comprised [[popular music]] played or sung by unknown orchestras or singers, or conversely, once famous singers or orchestras playing music or songs that were relatively unknown (popular singers' early and obscure recordings were often showcased as well). 

By the LP era, in some cases (notably the least expensive of the records) the record album would have only one [[cover version]] of a famous song or tune. Many of these albums had attractive [[album cover]] artwork (often picturing beautiful starlets such as [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Irish McCalla]], and the then-unknown [[Mary Tyler Moore]]). The album were often filled out with music in the [[public domain]] or obscure music never recorded by anyone else. Sometimes the "[[orchestra]]s" comprised very few musicians, were performed by background music companies, or were recorded outside the United States by orchestras credited under different names, such as ''[[101 Strings]]''.

Despite major record companies lowering their prices or starting their own budget labels, the budget album companies, such as Coronet who sold their LPs for 99 cents, remained popular.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|page=26|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugstore records originated with [[Pickwick International]], founded by [[Cy Leslie]]. Leslie's first business was a prerecorded [[greeting card]] service that turned into children's record label Voco Records in 1946. In 1950 Leslie founded [[Pickwick Records]] and by 1953 Pickwick entered the [[LP album|LP]] market providing lower priced records.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann, Frank Editor &amp; Ferstler, Howard Technical Editor ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound'' Routledge (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early producer of drugstore records was [[Enoch Light]], who started [[Waldorf Music Hall Records]] under the auspices of the [[F.W. Woolworth]] [[dime store]] chain. Unlike most drugstore record producers, Light was well regarded both  as a musician and for his technical recording knowledge; which he would make much use of later in establishing [[Command Records]].

Probably the best known and most prolific drugstore label was [[Crown Records]], an offshoot of [[Modern Records]], originally a jazz label owned by the Bihari brothers and operated from Los Angeles. From the mid-1950s to the early 80s, Crown turned out hundreds of cheaply produced LPS of country, Hawaiian, Latin, and other musical genres; often performed by pseudonymous studio groups; as well as jazz and blues material reissued from the Modern label.

==Major labels enter the budget album market==
In 1954 Pickwick entered into a licensing arrangement with [[Capitol Records]] giving Pickwick the rights to press and distribute Capitol's secondary and noncurrent titles on their label. Pickwick's records were mostly sold in stores other than record shops such as [[department stores]], [[dimestores]], [[Pharmacy|drugstores]], and [[supermarkets]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; Pickwick later had several subsidiaries such as Bravo, Design, International Award, Hurrah, Grand Prix, and [[Hallmark Records]] in the U.K.

[[RCA Records]] introduced [[RCA Camden Records]] in 1955, a budget label for re-releasing older recordings by currently popular artists on the label or vintage material from previous decades. Occasionally, original music was produced for release on RCA Camden such as children's music and instrumentals. RCA Camden also released single albums of country music recorded especially for the budget label by many of its newer country acts of the 1960s such as [[Connie Smith]], [[Liz Anderson]], and [[Dottie West]] to perhaps encourage sales of the artists' full-priced product. RCA Camden was particularly successful in repackaging older [[Elvis Presley]] recordings on the Camden label, as well as previously released and also unreleased material he recorded for his motion pictures, making these albums among the select few budget albums to actually make the national best-selling charts. At one point the Camden albums were doing so well that two of Presley's major hit singles of the early 1970s - "Burning Love" and "Separate Ways" (and their respective flipsides) made their album debuts not on mainstream RCA released, but on RCA Camden. Not long before Presley's death, RCA sold the Camden label to Pickwick.

The major labels' budget album releases were seldom sold at "drug stores", mainly at [[record shops]] and [[department stores]] just like the full-price product although RCA Camden did on occasion market their albums in speciality "drug store" racks. The major label budget albums usually had eight to ten songs on them (usually nine) as opposed to full-price releases which contained ten to twelve songs.

[[Columbia Records]] re-introduced the [[Harmony Records]] line around the same time for budget releases of older product repackaged. Harmony, however, seldom issued material that had not been previously released (Columbia has used the Harmony name from 1926 through 1932 and again in the late 1940's).

The budget albums' heyday was in the late 1960s and early 1970s when nearly every recording artist of note had one or more such collections on the market. Often these were recordings done for a previous record label before the star's current popularity.

Other major labels of the day with their own budget lines include:
*[[Atlantic Records]] had a short-lived budget label, [[Clarion Records]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/clarion.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cameo-Parkway]] created [[Wyncote Records]]
*[[Columbia Records]]' budget label was [[Harmony Records]]
*[[Decca Records]]' budget label was [[Vocalion Records]]
*[[EMI]] created [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure (MFP)]] (In the UK)
*[[Dot Records]]' budget label was [[Hamilton Records]]
*[[Liberty Records]]' budget label was [[Sunset Records]]
*[[Mercury Records]] operated [[Wing Records]]
*[[MGM Records]] released [[Metro Records]] and [[Lion Records (MGM)|Lion Records]]
*[[Modern Records]] created Crown Records&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/crown.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RCA Victor Records]] released [[RCA Camden Records]] 
*[[Starday Records]] (arguably a budget label itself) created Nashville Records
*[[United Artists Records]] produced [[Unart Records]]

Other budget record labels were [[Somerset Records]] that became [[Alshire Records]] in 1963,&lt;ref name="spaceagepop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/shermana.htm|title=Al Sherman|publisher=spaceagepop.com|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo Fidelity, Audio Spectrum, Peter Rabbit (children's records), Azteca,&lt;ref&gt;Pavlakis, Christopher ''the American Music Handbook" Collier-Macmillan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Score Records, a subsidiary of [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]], Custom, and [[Diplomat Records (budget)|Diplomat Records]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbiddeneye.com/labels/diplomat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014435/http://forbiddeneye.com/labels/diplomat.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a product of the [[Synthetic Plastics Company]] who made [[Peter Pan Records]] and Ambassador Records.

In [[United Kingdom|England, UK]] the [[Woolworths Group]] jointly owned [[Embassy Records]] with [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole Records]], later part of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]].

The [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure (MFP)]] label was set up in 1965 as a joint venture between [[EMI]], which provided the source material, and the publisher [[Paul Hamlyn]], which handled distribution in so-called non-traditional outlets, such as [[W.H. Smith]], the booksellers. The MFP catalogue consisted of both original material and reissues of existing EMI recordings.

== Notable artists ==

Notable artists to have begun their careers recording for budget albums include [[Lou Reed]], [[Jerry Cole]],&lt;ref name="hdtracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=artistdetail&amp;id=2597|title=Hdtracks - UK Home page &amp;#124; HDtracks - The World's Greatest-Sounding Music Downloads|publisher=hdtracks.com|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Ra]], [[Al Kooper]] and [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]]. Perhaps the most notable artists to emerge from a career as a "cover artist" for budget albums include [[Dolly Parton]], who early in her career as a teenaged vocalist, recorded several covers of [[Kitty Wells]] hits for budget album release, and [[Elton John]], who recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s for the [[Top of the Pops (record series)|''Top of the Pops'']] album series.

'''Chambers of rhetoric''' ({{lang-nl|rederijkerskamers}}) were dramatic societies in the [[Low Countries]]. Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the [[French language|French]] word 'rhétoricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and [[lyrics]]. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early [[public relations]] for the city.&lt;ref name=Waite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g9ntQF9q1rAC Reformers on stage: popular drama and religious propaganda in the low countries] by Gary Waite on [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first chambers of rhetoric were founded in [[Flanders]] around the 15th century; they later flowered in [[Holland]], where they were an important part of the literary scene in the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and experimented with poetic form and structure. Most Dutch cities sponsored a chamber of rhetoric, and many cities had more than one, which competed with each other during prize contests. The building that currently houses the [[Frans Hals Museum]] was built with the proceeds of a lottery in which chambers of rhetoric participated from all over the country. The Haarlem society [[Trou moet Blycken]] still has many of the blazoens that it kept as host of that lottery.

At the start of the 16th century, Antwerp had three rederijker societies, the "[[Violieren]]", the "[[De Olijftak|Olijftak]]", and the "[[Goudbloem]]", while Brussels and Ghent each had four rederijker societies.&lt;ref name=Waite/&gt;

An important chamber of rhetoric in the Netherlands was "De [[Egelantier]]" in Amsterdam: [[Samuel Coster|Coster]], [[Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero|Bredero]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|Hooft]] and [[Roemer Visscher]] were all members of this society. During the [[Protestant Reformation]] the society sided with the reformers against the city government and enjoyed its most blooming period despite receiving very little funding from official sources.&lt;ref name=Waite/&gt;

Because many of the ''rederijkers'' were by definition amateurs, the literary quality of their work was often rather low, and in the 18th century, some chambers of rhetoric were spoken of with contempt.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} One work of literary historical importance that came from the Rederijkers is the play ''[[Elckerlijc]]'' (Everyman).

By the 17th century many chambers enjoyed the services of semi-professional actors, ''personagiën'', who did not pay membership fees and worked in exchange for free food and drink (provided after rehearsals and performances) and for exemption from other civic obligations.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Keersmaekers, ''Geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Rederijkerskamers in de jaren 1585–1635'' (Aalst, 1952), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social functions==
Apart from providing entertainment (recitations, plays, performances) during civic festivities, and maintaining literary contacts between cities, chambers of rhetoric had many of the typical social functions of a [[guild]] or [[confraternity]], such as attending members' funerals, holding collections for sick or impoverished members, and providing wedding presents for members getting married.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Keersmaekers, ''Geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Rederijkerskamers in de jaren 1585–1635'' (Aalst, 1952), pp. 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chelsea Theater Center''' was a [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] [[theater company]] founded in 1965 by [[Robert Kalfin]], a graduate of the [[Yale School of Drama]]. It opened its doors in a church in the Chelsea district of Manhattan, then moved to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in 1968, where it was in residence for ten years.

==History==
Kalfin, the artistic producer, wanted to do the kind of work that had marked commercial off-Broadway in its prime but which, as a result of escalating production costs, could no longer realize a profit. By 1969, he was working with two new partners, also Yale graduates, [[Michael David (producer)|Michael David]], executive producer, and Burl Hash, production manager. They made it possible for him to realize the work he envisioned.

In the 1970s, the Chelsea produced plays that were unfamiliar to most spectators, even to many theater professionals. These included unusual European classics, new plays, and major works by well-known playwrights that were too complex and expensive for most non-profit theaters and too limited in audience appeal for most commercial producers.

For instance, the Chelsea staged the first uncut production of [[Jean Genet]]'s seven-hour long ''[[The Screens]]'' and the first New York production of [[Peter Handke]]'s ''[[Kaspar (play)|Kaspar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Napoleon, Davi  |title=[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]] |pp=70-88 (The Screens), 104-110 (Kaspar) |publisher=Iowa State University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater introduced New York audiences to the works of England's new generation of [[Royal Court Theatre]] playwrights, including [[Edward Bond]], [[Christopher Hampton]], [[David Storey]] and [[Heathcote Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon, Davi, ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]'', pages 50-57 Saved, Total Eclipse 141-145, The Contractor 111-114, AC/DC 59-63) |publisher=Iowa State University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11&lt;/ref&gt; It unearthed works that had been lost to contemporary audiences, such as Kleist's ''The Prince of Homburg''; Witkiewitz's surrealistic plays, ''The Crazy Locomotive'' and ''The Water Hen''; [[John Gay]]'s ''The Beggar's Opera'' and ''Polly''; and [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''Sunset''. .&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon, Davi, ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]'', pages 185-212 Kliest, 208-215 Locomotive, 93-96 Water Hen, 85-86, Beggar's, 170-174 Polly, 101-103 Sunset) |publisher=Iowa State University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Kaddish'', a play based on a screenplay inspired by a poem by [[Allen Ginsberg]], the Chelsea transformed two other genres into a multi-media theatrical event. With ''Yentl the Yeshiva Boy'', it metamorphized a short story by [[Isaac Singer]] into a powerful dramatic production. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/obituaries/leah-napolin-whose-yentl-adaptation-made-broadway-dies-at-83.html&lt;/ref&gt; Then with ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'', it integrated staples of commercial musical theater with experimental environmental staging.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon, Davi, ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]'', pages 82-89Kaddish; 151-163, 170, 172; 118-132|publisher=Iowa State University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11&lt;/ref&gt; The Chelsea was well-regarded by theatre critics. Some performers left Broadway shows to appear on the Chelsea's stage in Brooklyn, and well-known artists such as [[Frank Langella]], [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Hal Prince]] were anxious to work at the Chelesea. .&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon, Davi, ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]'', pages 16, 32, 185, 187, 195, 198, 218, and back cover blurb Langella; back cover blurbs also provided by Glenn Close and New York Times culture editor, Tom Lask; 168, 214-215, Streep; xiv (foreword to book, 116-131, 144, 260 Prince) |publisher=Iowa State University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11&lt;/ref&gt; Others who worked at the Chelsea early in their careers would become well known, including [[Glenn Close]], [[Brent Spiner]] and [[Des McAnuff]].&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon, Davi, ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]'', pages 201, 211, 256, back cover blurb, Close; 177, Spiner; 95, 208, 211, 222, 228-229, 233-235, McAnuff|publisher=Iowa State University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[Davi Napoleon]]'s chronicle, ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]'', actors were extremely loyal to the Chelsea. The entire company of ''Strider, the Story of a Horse'' (based on a short story by [[Leo Tolstoy]]) petitioned [[Actors' Equity Association]] to permit it to rehearse without remuneration when the Chelsea had no money to continue production; in a rare move, the union agreed.

Eventually, funding sources for the non-profit theater decreased radically and the Chelsea could not adjust. The theater moved out of Brooklyn, attempting to find a wider audience in Manhattan, but it eventually met with defeat. In the process, they opened the [[off-Broadway]] [[Westside Theatre]]. The company folded in 1984.

'''Critical making''' refers to the hands-on productive activities that link digital technologies to society.
It was invented to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiSalvo, C|title=Design and the Construction of Publics|journal=Design Issues|year=2009|volume=25|series=1|page=48|doi=10.1162/desi.2009.25.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of critical making resides in the learning extracted from the process of making rather than the experience derived from the finished output. The term "critical making" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/article/critical-making-matt-ratto/&lt;/ref&gt; Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as way "to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ratto, M. |author2=Ree, R. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Materializing information: 3D printing and social change.|journal=First Monday|year=2012|volume=17|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Critical making", as defined by practitioners like Matt Ratto and Stephen Hockema, "is an elision of two typically disconnected modes of engagement in the world — "critical thinking," often considered as abstract, explicit, linguistically based, internal and cognitively individualistic; and "making," typically understood as tacit, embodied, external, and community-oriented."

[[File:Materials for critical making.jpg|thumb|right|Arduino Hardware]]
==History of Critical Making==
=== Matt Ratto and Critical Making ===
Matt Ratto coined the term in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Ratto, Matt. "Flwr Pwr: Tending the Walled Garden." 2-day Critical Making Workshop for the Walled Garden conference, Virtueel Platform, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, November 20–22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making. This concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards [[Critical design|creating]] and/or making things within a technological context.&lt;ref name="CriticalMaking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratto|first=Matt|title=Critical Making: Conceptual and Material Studies in technology and Social Life|journal=The Information Society|year=2011|volume=27|pages=252|doi=10.1080/01972243.2011.583819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratto's first publication to use the term was in 2009. Ratto claims that his goal was to connect the conceptual understanding of technology in social life to materialized activities. By situating himself within the area of "design-oriented research" rather than "research-oriented research," Ratto believes that critical making enhances the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio-technical issues.&lt;ref name="CriticalMaking"/&gt; However, critical making should not be reviewed as design, but rather as a type of practice. The quality of a critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical "making" process, regardless of quality of the final material production.&lt;ref name="OpenDesignCriticalMaking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratto|first=Matt|title=Open Design and Critical Making|journal=Open Design Now: Why Design Cannot Remain Exclusive|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior studies have noted the separation between critical thinking and physical "making". Specifically, experts in technology lack a knowledge of art, and vice versa. However it is very important that technology be embedded in a context rather than being left in isolation, especially when it comes to critical making.

The Critical Making Lab was founded by Matt Ratto in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The Critical Making Lab provides participants tools and basic knowledge of digital technology used in critical making. The mission of the lab is to enhance collaboration, communication, and the practice-based engagement in critical making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Lab|url=http://criticalmaking.com/about/|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of critical making is open design.&lt;ref name="OpenDesignCriticalMaking"/&gt;Open design develops a critical perspective on the current institutions, practices and norms of society, reconnecting materiality and morality. Matt Ratto introduces Critical Making as processes of material and conceptual exploration and creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves. Critical Making includes digital software and hardware. Software usually refers to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Hardware refers to a computer, or any other device that facilitates an operation.

=== Garnet Hertz and Critical Making ===
In 2012, [[Garnet Hertz]] adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled "Critical Making" published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/ &lt;/ref&gt; It explores how hands-on productive work ‐ making ‐ can supplement and extend critical reflection on technology and society. It works to blend and extend the fields of design, contemporary art, DIY/craft and technological development. In this project, 70 different authors - including [[Norman White]], [[Julian Bleecker]], [[Dunne &amp; Raby]], [[Daniel Charny]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Golan Levin]], [[Matt Ratto]], [[Natalie Jeremijenko]], [[McKenzie Wark]], [[Paul Dourish]], [[Mitch Altman]], [[Dale Dougherty]], [[Mark Pauline]], [[Scott Snibbe]], [[Reed Ghazala]] and others - reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement. Generally speaking, Hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as "things to think with".&lt;ref&gt;http://futureeverything.org/events/critical-making/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertz initially set out to make a zine of about 50 pages but was flooded with almost 300 pages of original content from approximately sixty people. It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing multiple booklets. The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment. Recently, Make received a grant from DARPA to create "makerspaces" for teenagers. Everyone who had assumed that a culture built on openness was antithetical to the murkiness that surrounds the military world was bitterly disheartened. However, CM is not the anti-Make Magazine, it is simply an alternative, a forum for electronic DIY practice to discuss hacking, making, kludging, DIYing in a less sanitized, mass-market way.

In 2014, Hertz founded "The Studio for Critical Making" at [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]] as [[Canada Research Chair]] in [[Design]] and [[Media Arts]]. The facility "explores how humanities-based modes of critical inquiry – like the arts and ethics – can be directly applied to building more engaging product concepts and information technologies. The lab works to replace the traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed or usability with more complex cultural, social and human-oriented values. The end result is technology that is more culturally relevant, socially engaged and personalized." &lt;ref&gt;http://research.ecuad.ca/criticalmaking/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses of Critical Making ===
In 2012, [[John Maeda]] began using the term while at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD): first as a title for their strategic plan for 2012-2017 and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled "The Art of Critical Making: Rhode Island School of Design on Creative Practice" published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118517865.html &lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals who use the term critical making to orient their work include [[Amaranth Borsuk]] ([[University of Washington]]-Bothell), Jentery Sayers ([[University of Victoria]]), Roger Whitson ([[Washington State University]]), Kari Kraus ([[University of Maryland]]), Amy Papaelias ([[SUNY-New Paltz]]), and Jessica Barness ([[Kent State University]]).

== Concepts Related to Critical Making ==

=== DIY and Critical Making ===
Traditional DIY is criticized due to its costs and standards. DIY products are difficult to spread in lower-income areas where issues of cost and ease are more commonly cited (William, 276).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Colin C.|title=A lifestye choice? Evaluating the motives of do-it-yourself (DIY) consumers. I|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4/5|page=276|doi=10.1108/09590550410534613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, TET increases the technological standard of DIY,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kuznetsov, S. |author2= Paulos, E. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Rise of the expert amateur: DIY projects, communities, and cultures.|journal=In Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Extending Boundaries|year=2010|pages=295–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhance the modernity of it, and open up a more practical and advanced area for DIY projects to develop. It is not only a lifestyle choices but also a technological product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blikstein, P.|title=Gears of our childhood: constructionist toolkits, robotics, and physical computing, past and future|journal=In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children|year=2013|pages=173–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; "DIY activity is not for example seen as a coping practice used by those unable to afford to externalise the activity to formal firms and/or self-employed individuals. Instead, and reflecting the broader cultural turn in retail studies, their explanation for engagement in DIY is firmly grounded in human agency" (Williams, 273).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Colin C.|title=A lifestye choice? Evaluating the motives of do-it-yourself (DIY) consumers. I|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4/5|page=273|doi=10.1108/09590550410534613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speculative Design and Critical Making ===
According to DiSalvo and Lukens, "Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented. However this should not be mistaken as being fantasy-like sense, suggesting, that is "unreal" and therefore dismissible (DiSalvo and Lukens, 2009)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lukens, J. |author2= DiSalvo, C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Speculative Design and Technological Fluency|journal=International Journal of Learning|year=2011|volume=3|series=4|pages=23–40|doi=10.1162/ijlm_a_00080}}{{Dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines, including visionary or futurist forms of architecture, design fiction, and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style. More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures, speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture, technology, and the built environment (Lukens and DiSalvo, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;25). Practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation, one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long-term implications of technology. These practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate, such as fact and fiction, science and art, and commerce and academia. This provocation extends to questions about design itself.

=== [[3D printing|3D Printing]] and Critical Making ===
3D Printing allows for the relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects. There are two types of industrial manufacturing. The first is subtractive manufacturing, which involves shaping a material through a process of chipping / removing some of its substance (think whittling a figure out of wood). The second is additive manufacturing, which is created by adding material into a product. The basic steps of 3D printing are digital design: design the object you want to print using digital design software OR download a design from a website (like Thingiverse, for example), press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design. 3D printers use layerization to create objects. 3D printers use a variety of materials to create objects, including plastic, metal and nylon (Flemming, What is 3D printing?). The Makerbot, for example, uses polylactic acid (PLA), a substance derived from corn. The coiled PLA filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder, causing the PLA to melt. This melted material forms the model's layers, which is applied in approximately .02 - 1 millimeter layers. The model is built up until it is finished.

'''''Dancing Through Life''''' is a [[public art]] work by artist [[Schomer Lichtner]]. It is installed on the  [[Milwaukee Riverwalk|Riverwalk]] in Pere Marquette Park in downtown [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].

==Description==
The steel sculpture depicts a [[ballerina]] "poised prettily" on a [[cow]].&lt;ref name=Auer&gt;{{cite news|last=Auer|first=James|title=Whimsy marked Lichtner's long artistic career|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=11 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cow is painted green, purple, blue and yellow, with a black face, white triangular nose and red horns. The ballerina bends one knee to rest on the back of the cow and kicks her other leg overhead. She wears a red and white [[polka dot|polka-dotted]] [[leotard]], white [[ballet tutu|tutu]] and red [[ballet slippers]]. Both arms extend aloft, and she holds a blue fan above her head in one hand. The entire composition incorporates folds and [[assemblage art|assemblage]] to create a sense of angularity and dynamism.

==Location==
''Dancing Through Life'' occupies a prominent location at the southern entrance to Pere Marquette Park. Lichtner collaborated with the Riverwalk District BID to contribute to its [[RiverSculpture!]] program by placing the sculpture at this location.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams-Ng|first=Stacey|title=Milwaukee artists Grotenrath, Lichtner were the power couple of brush and easel|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/119956394.html#!page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The government has changed from a monarchy to a democracy by order of a king who had ascended to the throne by succession. While the people have now attained the right to vote, the only candidates are the king’s twenty-four sons, who will each serve for terms lasting two years. In the successive reign of each brother, oppression and injustice abound, and they spend their terms feasting, pillaging and plundering the country as much as possible, lining their pockets with enough cash to live out their days in luxury. Each time heading up to the new election, the people take refuge in their wishful thinking that the administration of the “next” prince will make things better. But things never change. The princes had all inherited their grandfather’s first name, “Demo” as a prefix to their names. The king had named his twenty-fifth son who was lacking in both appearance, intelligence and character, Demo C’est Assez (meaning Demo “is enough”) but this last prince became known among the people instead as Demo Crazy because of his devious mind and volatile behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphmedia.org/%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%87-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B9%DB%8C/|title= دموکراسی یا دموقراضه |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tnews.ir/news/3e1758467226.html|title= ممول حاکم غربستان خیالی - کتاب نیوز |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghatreh.com/news/nn30511686/%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1|title= کتاب صوتی «دموکراسی یا دموقراضه» منتشر شد |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to deny any of the twenty-four brothers a second chance at the throne, the people finally decide to vote for prince number twenty-five, Demo Crazy, who is in no way considered qualified for the position. The people actually do not believe that he will win, but they vote for him because they believe that he will most likely be the least brutal, and less of a tyrant than any of the other brothers. Demo Crazy forms a circle of cohorts and enacts his own Demo Crazian principles which consist of a combination of oppression and deception of the masses. He embarks upon a mission to destroy the country, playing off his actions as a “service” to the people. As it turns out, he is really in fact an enemy agent, who after ultimately fleeing his own country and ta king refuge in enemy lands, surrenders his nation to them. The behavior and documented speeches of Demo Crazy are truly astonishing, and even more unusual are the laws and regulations he exercised in ruling over his country. The question of whether or not the standard and conventional democracy in the world today is predicated upon the principles and methods that Demo Crazy carried out in this book is presented only as food for thought and not as a steadfast claim. The answer to this question will be left for the reader to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Crazy-Seyed-Mehdi-Shojaei/dp/9642667800|title= Democracy or Demo Crazy by Seyed Mehdi Shojaee|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=English|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27025426-democracy-or-demo-crazy|title= Democracy or Demo Crazy by Seyed Mehdi Shojaee|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=English|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15418686|title= دموکراسی یا دموقراضه by سید مهدی شجاعی |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2880">'''Duodji''' is a traditional [[Sami people|Sami]] [[handicraft]], dating back to a time when the Sami were far more isolated from the outside world than they are today. Duodji tools, clothing and accessories are functional and useful, and may also incorporate artistic elements. Sami duodji artists are able to bring [[Applied art|function and art]] together in a delicate way so as to create beautiful works of art in their own right.

These functional items include knives, cases, ladies' bags, wooden cups, certain articles of clothing, etc. Duodji items were made and meant to be used in an everyday work environment.

[[Image:Kuksa_2006_09_09.JPG|thumb|right|Drinking cup (guksi) also used for [[Bushcraft]]]]
[[Image:Samekniven.JPG|thumb|right|A small Sámi knife (decorative picture not traditional)]]

==Materials used==
Traditionally Sami handicraft was divided into two sub-groups, men's and women's handicraft. Men used mostly wood and antlers as well as other bones from reindeer when crafting, while women used leather and roots. The traditional Sami colours are red, green, blue and yellow.

==Well known artists==
Duodji artists are still active in [[Sápmi (area)|Sapmi]] and still carry on the traditions of the Duodji. Although there have been slight changes in the traditional Duodji, today they are considered valuable pieces of art by collectors from all over the world. Some of the Duodji artists today are [[Olov Svonni]], [[Martin Kuorak]], [[Anders Sunna]], [[Lars Pirak]] and [[Per Olof Utsi]].

==Gákti==

The traditional costume, the [[Gakti|gákti]], is of great cultural importance and is mainly used for weddings, funerals, confirmations and other cultural events. The gákti's appearance differs from place to place and it tends to be longer in southern Sápmi than in the north. Traditionally leather, sinews, and wool was used to make the gákti, today however both velvet and silk can be used.

[[File:Eleanor Rigby 2018-1.jpg|thumb|Eleanor Rigby statue]]
'''Eleanor Rigby''' is a statue in [[Stanley Street, Liverpool|Stanley Street]], [[Liverpool]], England, designed and made by the entertainer [[Tommy Steele]].  It is based on the subject of [[The Beatles]]' song ''[[Eleanor Rigby]]'', which is credited to the [[Lennon–McCartney]] partnership.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt;

==History==
When Tommy Steele was performing in a show in Liverpool in 1981, he made an offer to [[Liverpool City Council]] to create a sculpture as a tribute to the Beatles.  His fee for the commission would be three pence.{{efn|This was an allusion to Steele's [[musical show]] and film ''[[Half a Sixpence]]''.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt;}}  The offer was accepted by the Council, as it would be expected to increase the tourist trade of the city, and they made a donation of £4,000 towards its cost.  The statue took nine months to make, and it was unveiled by Tommy Steele on 3 December 1982.&lt;ref name=cav&gt;{{Citation | last = Cavanagh| first = Terry | author-link = | year = 1997| title = Public Sculpture of Liverpool| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Liverpool| publisher = Liverpool University Press| pages = 213–214 | format = | id = | isbn = 978-0-853-23711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The statue consists of a bronze figure on a stone bench.  The bronze figure is 128&amp;nbsp;cm high, 120&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and 96&amp;nbsp;cm deep.  It depicts a seated woman with a handbag on her lap, a shopping bag on her right, and a copy of the newspaper the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' on her left.  Poking from the shopping bag is a milk bottle, and on the newspaper is a [[sparrow]] and a piece of bread.  The woman is looking down at the sparrow.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt;

On the wall behind the figure is an inscribed plaque which originally read
&lt;poem&gt;{{centre|ELEANOR RIGBY}}
{{centre|DEDICATED TO}}
{{centre|"ALL THE LONELY PEOPLE..."}}
{{centre|This statue was sculpted and donated to the City of Liverpool}}
{{centre|by Tommy Steele as a tribute to the Beatles.}}
{{centre|The casting was sponsored by the Liverpool Echo.}}
{{centre|DECEMBER 1982}} &lt;/poem&gt;
but this has since been replaced.

In [[architecture]], an '''ell''' is a [[wing (building)|wing]] of a building that lies perpendicular to the length of the main portion.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Francis D. K. (1995). A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. p. 26. {{ISBN|0-442-02462-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes its name from the shape of the letter [[L]].  Ells are often additions to an existing building which make it L-shaped in plan.  In [[connected farm]] architecture, the ell is often extended to attach the main house to another building, usually a [[barn]].

The '''Emblem of Tamil Nadu''' is the official state emblem of [[Tamil Nadu]] and is used as the official state symbol of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. 

It consists of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] without the bell lotus foundation and flanked on either side by an [[Flag of India|Indian flag]]. Behind the capital, is the image of a ''[[gopuram]]'' or [[Hindu temple|temple]] tower based on the Tower of sri andal temple located at srivilliputtur, Virudhunagar district.

==Designing==
The state emblem was designed in 1949 by artist R. Krishna Rao who was a native of Madurai.&lt;ref name="madrasmusings_vol21no6"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Which-Tamil-Nadu-temple-is-the-state-emblem/articleshow/55285143.cms| | title=Which Tamil Nadu temple is the state emblem? | date=7 November 2016 | agency=TOI | accessdate=20 January 2018 | author=Swaroop, Vishnu | location=Madurai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna Rao was honoured with awards and titles for his contribution to the state.&lt;ref name="madrasmusings_vol21no6" /&gt; A student of the Government College of Fine Arts and Crafts in Chennai, who went on to become the principal of the college later, Rao was approached to design the emblem in 1948, when he was a professor of applied arts in the college.  

Around the rim of the seal runs an inscription in Tamil script, one at the top தமிழ் நாடு அரசு  ("Tamil Nadu Arasu" which translates to "Government of Tamil Nadu") and other at the bottom வாய்மையே வெல்லும்  ("Vaymaiye Vellum" which translates to "Truth Alone Triumphs" also commonly known as "[[Satyameva Jayate]]" in Sanskrit). It is the only state that has Indian Flag on its seal.

== Controversy ==
Although the gopuram in the emblem is generic and does not carry specific references, [[Srivilliputhur Andal temple]] gopuram came to be known as the state emblem, even in government records due to the TKC-Reddy episode. But R Krishna Rao, the artist who created it said he had the [[Meenakshi Temple|Madurai Meenakshi temple]]'s west 'gopuram' in mind while designing a generic `gopuram' for the emblem. A monograph on Rao, published by the Lalit Kala Akademi quotes him as saying, "Hailing from Madurai, it was only proper that I should incorporate the Madurai temple in the state government's emblem."
 
Rao's student G Chandrashekaran, also a former principal of the college, feels the theory of Madurai temple being the inspiration may not be off the mark. "It could be said that the inspiration for designing the emblem came from the Madurai temple, as Krishna Rao had done several watercolours of the structure. There are no records of him having painted the Srivilliputhur temple."

K Kamala, Krishna Rao's daughter and an artist herself, says that her father regretted the gopuram being wrongly identified all the time. "He always asked me to tell people that it was the Madurai gopuram and not of Srivilliputhur", says Kamala, adding that she got to see the original painting at the Government College of Fine Arts and Crafts in Chennai in 2009. "The features of the gopuram can be clearly seen in the original painting, and one could see very well that it is the Madurai gopuram. My father had painted the figurines of Siva and Parvati on the Rishaba vahanam, seen in the gopuram in the Madurai temple. That was a clear sign," she says.

Efforts to trace the original painting which is supposed to have been incorporated into the state emblem were futile.

The '''film industry''' or '''motion picture industry''', comprises the technological and commercial institutions of [[filmmaking]], i.e., film [[production company|production companies]], [[film studio]]s, [[cinematography]], [[animation]], [[film production]], [[screenwriting]], [[pre-production]], [[post production]], [[film festival]]s, [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[actor]]s, [[film director]]s and other [[film crew]] personnel.

Though the expense involved in making [[film]]s almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed [[independent film]] production to evolve. [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] is the oldest film industry of the world, and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. [[Indian cinema]] (including [[Bollywood]]) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually)&lt;ref&gt;Matusitz, J., &amp; Payano, P. (2011). The Bollywood in Indian and American Perceptions: A Comparative Analysis. ''India Quarterly: A Journal of International Affairs'', ''67''(1), 65–77. {{doi|10.1177/097492841006700105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,986 feature films produced annually.&lt;ref name="filmfed"&gt;{{cite web|title=INDIAN FEATURE FILMS CERTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 2017|url=http://www.filmfed.org/IFF2017.html|website=[[Film Federation of India]]|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide theatrical market had a box office of {{USD|38.6 billion}} in 2016. The top three continents/regions by box office gross were: Asia-Pacific with {{USD|14.9 billion}}, the U.S. and Canada with {{USD|11.4 billion}}, and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with {{USD|9.5 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lang |first=Brent |date=22 March 2017 |title=Global Box Office Hits Record $38.6 Billion in 2016 Even as China Slows Down |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/box-office-record-china-1202013961/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2016-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-Report-2.pdf |title=Theatrical Market Statistics 2016 |website=MPAA |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016}}, the largest markets by box office were, in decreasing order, the United States, China, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom. {{as of|2011}}, the countries with the largest number of film productions were India, Nigeria, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Daniel B. |title=The trend shift of the modern film industry |url=https://www.bollywikia.com/ |accessdate=2 April 2018 |agency=Lindale Avenue |issue=April '18 |publisher=San Fran &amp; co |date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, significant centers of movie production are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="EUROAVCOUNCIL-20090511"&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct from the centers are the locations where movies are filmed. Because of labor and infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries other than the one in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. movies are filmed in Canada, many Nigerian movies are filmed in [[Ghana]], while many Indian movies are filmed in the Americas, Europe, [[Singapore]] etc.

[[File:Hollywood Sign (Zuschnitt).jpg|thumb|The [[Hollywood Sign]]|226x226px]]
The [[cinema of the United States]], often generally referred to as '''Hollywood''', has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. [[Hollywood]] is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the [[American Film Institute]], [[LA Film School]] and NYFA being established in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyfa.edu/los-angeles/ Los Angeles Film Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; However, four of the [[Major film studio#Today's Big Six|six major film studios]] are owned by [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] companies. The [[major film studios]] of Hollywood including [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] are the primary source of the [[List of highest-grossing films|most commercially successful movies in the world]], such as  ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).

American film studios today collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. Only [[The Walt Disney Company]] — which owns [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the Walt Disney Studios]] — is fully based in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donckels|first=William|title=Disney Raises SoCal Annual Pass Prices 30% - to Keep Locals "Out"|url=http://technorati.com/business/article/disney-raises-socal-annual-pass-prices/|publisher=Technorati.com|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the [[Sony Corporation]], is headquartered in [[Tokyo]], Japan. Most shooting now takes place in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Hollywood is the most popular film industry with the highest number of screens, and is the highest-grossing film industry in the world. Between 2009-2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually.&lt;ref&gt;Number of total movies in 2014 are taken from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's award ceremony, the [[Academy Awards]], officially known as The Oscars, is held by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) every year and a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oscar Statuette|url = http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette|website = Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] which makes [[Cinema of the United States|United States cinema]] the earliest cinema in the whole world. Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner [[Thomas Armat]] modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to [[Thomas Edison]], who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.
[[File:Nestor studio 1911.jpg|thumb|223x223px|Nestor studio, 1911]]
[[Nestor Studios]] was Hollywood's first movie studio, founded on 27 October 1911. It was built by [[David Horsley]] for Nestor Motion Picture Company. It was then owned and operated by [[David Horsley]] and his brother, William Horsley. The first [[Sound stage|motion picture stage]] in Hollywood was built behind the tavern. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move
west. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, [[Al Christie]]. Other [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]] began opening studios in the [[Hollywood]] area. The Horsleys operated the [[Nestor Studios]] at the Sunset and Gower location until 20 May 1912, when the [[Universal Studios]] was formed, headed by [[Carl Laemmle]]. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's [[Independent Moving Pictures]] (IMP), was merged with Universal.

[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|Old Chinese Cinema in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]], China]]
The '''Cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] [[film|cinema]] together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]]. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. China is the home of the largest film studio in the world, the [[Hengdian World Studios]], and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving [[Entrepôt|entrepot]] and the largest city in the [[Far East]]. In 1913, the first independent Chinese [[screenplay]], ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in [[Shanghai]] by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = East Asian Cinema|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC|publisher = Oldcastle Books, Limited|date = 4 November 2010|isbn = 9781842433805|first = David|last = Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'' (2000) was funded in part by [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s production house,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Touch of Sin: Interview with Jia Zhang-ke|url = http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2014/05/16/a-touch-of-sin-interview-with-jia-zhangke/|website = Electric Sheep|accessdate = 3 December 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''Still Life'' was shot on HD video. ''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and [[Golden Lion]] winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth [[Generation]] Chinese directors like [[Zhang Yimou]] and [[Chen Kaige]] who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''The Promise'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2014, the gross box office in China was [[Renminbi|¥]]29.6 billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]4.82 billion), with domestic films having a share of 55%. The country is predicted to have the largest market in the world in 2017 or 2018.&lt;ref name="Frater"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/biz/asia/imax-china-sets-cautious-ipo-share-price-1201606822/|title= IMAX China Sets Cautious IPO Share Price|first= Patrick|last= Frater|date= 30 September 2015|accessdate= 9 October 2015|work= [[variety.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/dec/31/2013-global-box-office-review|title= Marvel rules, franchises dip, China thrives: 2013 global box office in review|first= Phil|last= Hoad|date=31 December 2013|accessdate= 11 January 2014|work= [[theguardian.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brzeski |first1=Patrick |last2=Coonan |first2=Clifford |date=3 April 2014 |title=Inside Johnny Depp's 'Transcendence' Trip to China |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/inside-johnny-depps-transcendence-trip-693223 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |quote=As China's box office continues to boom – it expanded 30 percent in the first quarter of 2014 and is expected to reach $4.64 billion by year's end – Beijing is replacing London and Tokyo as the most important promotional destination for Hollywood talent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/beijing-becomes-top-spot-international-hollywood-promotional-tours-1566444|title=Beijing Becomes A Top Spot On International Hollywood Promotional Tours|publisher=''[[International Business Times]]''|first=Michelle|last=FlorCruz|date=2 April 2014|quote=The booming mainland Chinese movie market has focused Hollywood's attention on the Chinese audience and now makes Beijing more important on promo tours than Tokyo and Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, China's gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China B.O. up 27% in 2013|url = http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/china-bo-up-27-in-2013|website = www.filmbiz.asia|accessdate = 2 December 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101005554/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/china-bo-up-27-in-2013|archivedate = 1 January 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in 2014, China's box office gross was $4.8 Billion, being the second largest [[box office]] grosser in film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MPAA-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-2014.pdf|title = Theatrical Market Statistics 2014 - MPAA|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest film and most popular industry in India is the [[Hindi cinema|Hindi film industry]] mostly concentrated in [[Mumbai]] (Bombay),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raja|first=Aditi|title=Film industry threatens it might have to move out of 'unsafe' Mumbai|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2181689/Film-industry-threatens-unsafe-Mumbai.html|publisher=Mail Online India|accessdate=28 November 2012|location=London|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly referred to as [[Bollywood]], an amalgamation of Bombay and Hollywood.

The other largest film industries are [[Tamil cinema]], [[Telugu cinema]], [[Kannada cinema]], [[Malayalam cinema]], [[Bangla cinema]] ([[cinema of West Bengal]]) and [[Marathi cinema]], which are located in [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Kochi]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Mumbai]]. The remaining majority portion is spread across northern, western, and southern India (with [[Gujarati cinema|Gujarati]], [[Cinema of Punjab|Punjabi]], [[Oriya cinema|Oriya]], [[Bhojpuri cinema|Bhojpuri]], [[Assamese Cinema]]). However, there are several smaller centers of Indian film industries in regional languages centered in the states where those languages are spoken. Indian films are made filled with musicals, action, romance, comedy, and an increasing number of special effects. It encloses a number of several artforms like Indian classical music, folk music of different regions throughout the country, Indian classical dance, folk dance and much more.

The 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the [[golden age]] of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable [[Film genre|genres]] (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, "If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office."&lt;ref name="retrospection"&gt;Farid, Samir, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm "Lights, camera...retrospection"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511112523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm |date=11 May 2013 }}, ''[[Al-Ahram]] Weekly'', 30 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Egypt's cinema has gone in separate directions.

The term "'''cinema of Korea'''" (or "'''Korean cinema'''") encompasses the motion picture industries of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late [[Joseon dynasty]] to [[Korean War|the Korean War]] to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.

South Korean films enjoyed a "Golden age" during the late 1950s, and 1960s, but by the 1970s had become generally considered to be of low quality.

Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas.  It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing [[film genre|genres]], like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels and remakes.  Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed [[star system (film)|star system]], which in this case also features substantial overlap with the [[Cantopop|pop music industry]].

{{see also|Cinema of Pakistan|Lollywood}}
The '''cinema of Pakistan''', or simply, '''Pakistani cinema''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پاکستانی سنیما}}}}) refers to [[Pakistan]]'s film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in [[Urdu]], the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. [[Lahore]] has been described as the epicentre of Pakistani cinema, giving rise to the term "[[Lollywood]]."

Before the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centres: [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Dhaka]]. The regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]]s, [[film piracy]], the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry's growth.&lt;ref name="dawn.com"&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1045365&lt;/ref&gt; Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s "an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.".&lt;ref&gt;an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywhat.com/beyond/pakistani.html The Beginner's Guide to Pakistani Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the industry has recently made a dramatic and remarkable comeback, evident from the fact that 18 of the 21 highest grossing Pakistani movies were released from 2013 through to the present, with Pakistani films frequently outcompeting Bollywood movies for the Pakistani audience, the industry is supported by Pakistani channels such as ARY and Geo whose entertainment divisions have invested significantly in Pakistani cinema when expanding from providing news and entertainment on TV channels, the lifting of strict regulations on production of films and reduction of taxes on cinemas helped to fuel an expansion across the industry from which the film industry has seen a revival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Bangladesh ===
{{see also|Cinema of Bangladesh|Dhallywood}}
The '''cinema of Bangladesh''' is the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language film industry based in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. The industry often has been a significant film industry since the early 1970s. The word "Dhallywood" is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and [[Hollywood]]. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is [[Melodrama|Melodramatic cinema]], which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company named Picture House was opened. A short silent film titled ''Sukumari'' (''The Good Girl'') was the first produced film in the region during 1928. The first full-length film ''The Last Kiss'', was released in 1931. From the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka is the center of Bangladeshi film industry, and generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences. The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s were the golden years for Bangladeshi films as the industry produced many successful films. ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh|The Face and the Mask]]'', the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film was produced in 1956.&lt;ref name=cholochitro&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bangladeshi Film|url=http://www.cholochitro.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=49|website=cholochitro.com|publisher=Cholochitro|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukh O Mukhosh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukh O Mukhosh |url=http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |publisher=bfa.gov.bd |accessdate=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021323/http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign films include major box offices from the west, and other major film producers of the world. This has caused a massive ripple effect on the country's economy. It is assumed that this increases the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally, was 1 million Rupiah. This is equivalent to US$100, as it includes a plane ticket to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/indonesia/new-import-policy-will-kill-indonesian-film-industry-noorca/423632 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923200931/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/indonesia/new-import-policy-will-kill-indonesian-film-industry-noorca/423632 |archivedate=23 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movies such as “Ivan the Terrible” (2004), “[[SistaGod]]” (2006), “I’m Santana: The Movie” (2012) and “God Loves the Fighter” (2013) were released both locally and internationally. “SistaGod” had its world premiere at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pires|first1=BC|title=SistaGod Put a Hand|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2014-01-27/sistagod-put-hand|work=Trinidad and Tobago Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Company]] is the national agency that was established in 2006 to further development of the film industry. Trinidad and Tobago puts on a number of film festivals which are organized by different committees and organizations. These include the Secondary Schools Short Film Festival and Smartphone Film Festival organized by Trinidad and Tobago Film Company. There is also an annual [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival]] which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.

{{main|Kallywood}}
Nepali film does not have a very long movie history, but the industry has its own place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as 'Nepali Chalchitra' (which translates to "Nepali movies" in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of "Kathmandu" and "Hollywood"; "Kollywood" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.[1] [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing movie of all time in Nepali Movie Industry and Kohinoor the second highest. Nepali movies has recently begun receiving international acclaim with films such as [[The Black Hen]] (2015), [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) and others. Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) has bagged the Best Film award at [http://sgiff.com/ the 27th Singapore International Film Festival] (SGIFF)(2016).

The Film Development Board (FDB) was established by the Government of Nepal for the development and promotion of the Nepali film industry. The Board is a liaison to facilitate the conceptualization, making, distribution and exhibition of Nepali films nationally. The Board attempts to bridge the gap between film entrepreneurship and government bureaucracy. The Board is a balance between the people at large, the government, and the process of film making. It is intended to act as the safeguard of the interests of the people, the watchdog of the government, and the advocate of filmmakers.

[[File:Story-of-the-kelly-gang-capture-1906.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Still frame|still]] from ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (Australia, 1906; 80&amp;nbsp;min.)]]

The first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.

=== Hollywood ===
The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word "Hollywood" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.

In 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].

The [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&amp;M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.

The famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read "Hollywoodland." It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest.

The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].

The first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.

From about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the "Hollywood studio system", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.

''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'' by [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]] was the first Indian dubbed film, released in Calcutta on 10 March 1935. Till then, all dialogues of all talkies were had to be recorded at locations during the shooting of the film. Through ''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'', dubbing technology was successfully introduced to Indian cinema by Assamese filmmaker [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]].&lt;ref name="Dainik Asam Assamese daily"/&gt;

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], World War II, the [[Indian independence movement]], and the violence of the [[Partition of India|Partition]]. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.&lt;ref name="britannica2"/&gt;

In 1937 [[Ardeshir Irani]], of ''[[Alam Ara]]'' fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, ''[[Kisan Kanya (1937 film)|Kisan Kanya]]''. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of ''Mother India''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

Profitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.

Substantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].

The film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.&lt;!-- several recent Ghibli productions --&gt;

On the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fragrance wheel''', variously called an '''aroma wheel''', a '''fragrance circle''', a '''perfume wheel''' or a '''smell wheel''', is a round diagram showing the inferred relationships among olfactory groups based upon similarities and differences in their odor. The groups bordering one another are implied to share common olfactory characteristics. Fragrance wheels are frequently used as a classification tool in [[oenology]] and [[perfumery]].

The first example of a fragrance wheel was conceived by Austrian perfumer [[Paul Jellinek]] and titled the ''Odor Effects Diagram'', published in the original German edition of his book ''The Practice of Modern Perfumery'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Jellinek, P. (1949) Praktikum des Modernen Parfümeurs, Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable versions include the ''Fragrance Circle'', developed in 1979 by U. Harder at Haarman &amp; Reimer, the ''Wine Aroma Wheel'', from 1984 by sensory chemist [[Ann C. Noble]], and the ''Fragrance Wheel'', created in 1992 by perfumery taxonomist [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Harder, U. (1979). Der H&amp;R duftkreis. 
Haarmann &amp; Reimer, Contact, 23, 18-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble, A.C., Arnold, R.A., Masuda, S.D., Pecore, J.O. Schmidt, and P.M. Stern, “Progress towards a standardized system of wine aroma terminology.” American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 35 (1984), pp. 107-109
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Michael. Fragrances of the World. Sydney, N.S.W.: Fragrances of the World, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragrance Chart==
{{generalize|date=April 2017}}
Since its creation, Michael Edwards' ''Fragrance Wheel'' and the developed fragrance classification scheme has been modified several times through the addition of different groups to encompass different fragrance types.&lt;ref name=MDB&gt;{{citation |title=Sniffapalooza Magazine Exclusive interview with Michael Edwards Fragrance Expert and Author of "Fragrances Of The World" |first=Mark David |last=Boberick |date=2010-03-30 |journal=Sniffapalooza Magazine |url=http://www.sniffapaloozamagazine.com/MICHAEL-EDWARDS-INTERVIEW-SNIFFAPALOOZA-MAGAZINE.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four standard families are '''Floral''', '''Oriental''', '''Woody''' and '''Fresh'''. These are in turn divided into three sub-groups (e.g. in the Floral Family: Floral, Soft Floral, Floral Oriental) and arranged in a circle, each group being related to the next. Each of the subclasses were in turn divided into ''Fresh'', ''Crisp'', ''Classical'', and ''Rich'' compositions. Prior to 2010 ''[[Fougère]]'' family was placed at the center of this wheel since they are a large family of scents that usually contain fragrance elements from each of the other four families; citrus from the ''fresh'' family, oak moss and woods from the ''woody'' family, coumarin and incense from the ''Oriental'' family, and lavender from the ''floral'' family.&lt;ref name=ME&gt;{{citation |title=Fragrances of the world 2008 |year=2008 |first=Michael |last=Edwards |publisher=Michael Edwards &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-9756097-3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this classification scheme, ''Chanel No.5'', which is traditionally classified as a "Floral Aldehyde" would be located under ''Soft Floral'' sub-group, and "Amber" scents would be placed within the ''Oriental'' group. As a class, [[Chypre]]s are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the ''Oriental'' and ''Woody'' families. For instance, ''Guerlain Mitsouko'', which is classically identified as a chypre will be placed under ''Mossy Woods'', but ''Hermès Rouge'', a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under ''Floral Oriental''.
Originally they are:

With the publication of Fragrances of the World 2008, two new sub-groups: ''Fruity'' and ''Woods'', have been added to the wheel.&lt;ref name=MDB/&gt;

The chart was again modified in 2010, moving the Aromatics/Fougere group to between ''Citrus'' and ''Dry Woods'' to synchronize the chart with recent studies on smell perception.&lt;ref name=MZ&gt;{{citation |title=Understanding the underlying dimensions in perfumers' odor perception space as a basis for developing meaningful odor maps |first=Manuel |last=Zarzo |first2=David T. |last2=Stanton |journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics |year=2009 |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=225–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Laura |last=Donna |title=Fragrance Perception: Is Everything Relative? |journal=Perfumer and Flavourist |volume=34 |date=December 2009  |pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Free Newfoundland Logo.gif|thumb|right|alt=Logo|The "Free Newfoundland" slogan on a T-Shirt by [http://livingplanet.ca/index.php/about/free-nfld The Living Planet clothing company, St. John's]]]

'''Free Newfoundland''' also written as "Free NFLD" is a [[slogan]] coined by [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] cartoonist Wallace Ryan in 1982. This slogan appeared on posters around [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] during the 1980s to encourage and promote Newfoundland &amp; Labrador nationalism. In the early 1990s, an unnamed artist painted this slogan at the end of George Street in St. John's without the knowledge or permission of Mr. Ryan. Although many in the province debate the meaning of the slogan, Mr. Ryan is quite explicit when it comes to the meaning of the slogan when asked about it. "'Free Newfoundland' is without doubt, a call to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador to seek a different path than that presented to us by Confederation and that path, is independence for the province."

In the mid-1990s, Mr. Ryan licensed the slogan to Living Planet to produce a line of t-shirts with the slogan accompanied by a bright red star above appearing above it. Living Planet has gone on to produce a line of products based on this slogan from mugs to underwear. It is one of the best selling t-shirts in the history of the company.

(NOTE: "NFLD" is the former postal acronym for Newfoundland and Labrador. It was replaced by "NF" and then in recent years, "NL")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6542">'''Gervase Alfred Booth Hughes''' (1 September 1905 – July 1984) was an English composer, conductor and writer on music.  From 1926 to 1933, Hughes pursued a career as a conductor and chorus master, principally at the [[British National Opera Company]], and also co-produced [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare plays]].  He left the musical profession in 1933, raising a family and working first as an executive in a railway company and later running luxury European tours.  From 1960 to 1972 he published a series of books on musical subjects, beginning with a study of the music of [[Arthur Sullivan]], published in 1960.

==Biography==
Hughes was born in [[Birmingham]], England, the son of Alfred Hughes, a university professor, and his wife Hester, ''née'' Booth.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/GLD/hits?r=d&amp;origSearch=true&amp;o=DataType&amp;n=10&amp;l=d&amp;c=1&amp;locID=wes_ttda&amp;secondary=false&amp;u=CA&amp;t=KW&amp;s=2&amp;NA=gervase+hughes Gervase Hughes] at ''Gale Contemporary Authors Online'', accessed 7 September 2009 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Malvern College]] and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he was active in the Oxford University Opera Club for whom he composed a [[light opera]].&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John. "University challenges", ''[[The Times]]'', 13 February 1986.  The opera was not performed.&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated with the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Music]] in 1927.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/search_results?q=gervase+hughes&amp;search=quick Gervase Hughes] at ''Grove Music Online'', accessed 7 September 2009 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1926 to 1929 Hughes was on the staff of the [[British National Opera Company]] and conducted ''[[Carmen]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and ''[[Samson et Dalila]]''.  The company gave several performances of his one-act operetta, ''Castle Creevey'', in 1928–30, and the score was published by [[Novello &amp; Co]].&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; In 1929–30 along with [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] and [[Jack Westrup]], he was one of three conductors of the London Opera Festival, for which he arranged and conducted [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'', its first British performance since the composer's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 28 October 1929, p. 12; and 7 January 1930, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Klein]] in ''[[The Gramophone]]'' commented that the costumes, the lines and the acting "made the audience rock with laughter," but added, "One reservation should be made, however, and that applies to the admirable work of Mr. Gervase Hughes, both in arranging the score and conducting the efficient orchestra, including the faultless accompaniments played upon the harpsichord by Mr. [[Boris Ord]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Gramophone'', February 1930, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1926–33 he was associated with [[Frank Benson (actor)|Sir Frank Benson]] and [[Oscar Asche]] in [[Shakespeare]] productions, presented under the management of "Gervase Hughes Ltd".&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 14 December 1932, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Hughes gave up music as a profession, though he continued to compose.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; He married Gwyneth Edwards, formerly an operatic [[soprano]], in April 1934, and the couple had two daughters.  From 1934–46 Hughes worked as an executive for the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]].&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; From 1947–59 he ran a specialist travel agency offering European tours in [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] cars.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 July 1947, p. 1; and 11 March 1959, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960 he embarked on a new career as an author of books on musical subjects, publishing eight books in the next twelve years.  In 1967 he was appointed a Vice-President of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] Society, a post he held until his death.&lt;ref name=News&gt;''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan News'', Volume 1, No. 6, November 1984, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes died in July 1984 at the age of 78.&lt;ref name=News/&gt;

===Books===
Hughes's first book on musical subjects was ''[https://archive.org/details/musicofarthursul006476mbp The Music of Arthur Sullivan]'' (1960), the first full-length study of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenwanger, William. "The Music of Arthur Sullivan by Gervase Hughes", ''Notes'', Second Series, Vol. 18, No. 1 (December 1960), pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; The book received good reviews&lt;ref&gt;see Lichtenwacher, above; Jacobs, Arthur, "The Music of Arthur Sullivan by Gervase Hughes", ''[[The Musical Times]]'' April 1960, p. 235; and (uncredited) "The Music of Arthur Sullivan by Gervase Hughes", ''Music Educators Journal'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (January 1961), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by a wider study of operetta in 1962 called ''Composers of Operetta'' (reissued in 1974).

[[File:Hemite1.jpg|thumb|300px|The outcrop with the relief (left), in the background Amouda castle (Hemite Kalesi)]]
The '''Hemite relief''' is a Hittite [[rock relief]] at [[Gökçedam]] (formerly ''Hemite'') in the central district of [[Osmaniye Province]] in [[Turkey]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the provincial capital of [[Osmaniye]].  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The relief, dating from the [[Hittite empire]] in the second millennium BC is located on the north bank of the [[Ceyhan river]] and faces south-southeast. In ancient times, the route from the Hittite heartland in the north, over the [[Anti-Taurus Mountains]] to [[Syria]] ran along this side of the river, before crossing it - so it linked [[Kizzuwatna]] (later called [[Cilicia]]) with east Anatolia. The importance which this nodal point retained even into the Middle Ages is indicated by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian]] fortress of [[Amouda]] (now ''Hemite Kalesi'') only 400 m further north.

== Description ==
[[File:Hemite2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hemite relief]]
The relief depicts a male figure, about 1.75 m high, whose clothing and weapons identify him as a warrior. In his outstretched right hand he holds a (badly weathered) spear. His left hand holds his bow which is borne over his shoulder. On the left side of his body there is a sword - the halfmoon grip and a loop for hanging it from his belt are clearly visible. He is dressed in a semi-circular cap with decorative bands, a short kilt and the ubiquitous Hittite pointed shoes. A large ring hangs from his ear. To the right of the image are two groups of [[Luwian hieroglyphs]], one above the other. According to [[John David Hawkins]]' translation, they name the figure as:

:...Tarḫunta, Prince
: Son of Tarḫuntabija, Prince

Hawkins suggests a possible connection with the Tarḫuntabijammi who is named in the [[Hanyeri relief]]. A prince named Tarḫuntabija also appears in the list of witnesses to the Ulmitessuba-Treaty made under [[Hattusili III]] (r. c. 1265-1240 BC).

The initial description of the relief was produced by [[Helmuth Theodor Bossert]] in 1946. The first detailed description was undertaken by [[Alfonso Archi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37561">Due to its complexity [[folklore]]  does not have a single definition. However, it can be considered as "the traditional art, literature, knowledge, and practices that are disseminated largely through oral communication and behavioural example".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afsnet.site-ym.com/?page=WhatIsFolklore|title=What Is Folklore? - American Folklore Society|website=afsnet.site-ym.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also include traditions, beliefs, worldviews, knowledge and skills (how to build a house, how to treat an illness), and talents (story-telling, songs, plays). All in all, folklore is an important part of group and national identity. As it can be studied as an understanding of how people live, giving an insight into people's daily life, it can have an academic value.

'''Irish folklore''', when mentioned to many people, conjures up images of banshees, fairy stories, leprechauns and people gathering around, sharing stories of a man as strong as 300 men put together. Many tales and legends were passed from generations to generations, so were the way to celebrate important moments such as marriages, deaths, birthday and holidays ([[Christmas]], [[Halloween]] (''Oíche Shamhna''), [[St. Patrick's day|St. Patrick's Day]]) or the way we hand down skills such as making weaved baskets or St. Bridget's crosses. All of the above can be considered as a part of folklore, as it is the study and appreciation of how people lived.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dominican-college.com/other/environment/139-irish-folklore-myth-and-reality|title=Irish Folklore: Myth and Reality|website=dominican-college.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classic Irish folklore ==
[[File:Banshee.jpg|alt=Bunworth Banshee, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825|thumb|Bunworth Banshee, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825]]
Irish folklore consists of many classics that are repeated to this day. Popular Irish folkltales include the Otherworld (''An Saol Eile)'', which revolves around the idea of supernatural manifestations and beings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62533994|title=The blessed and the damned : sinful women and unbaptised children in Irish folklore|last=1958-|first=O'Connor, Anne,|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3039105418|location=Oxford|oclc=62533994}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beings appear in many of the folkloristic genres such as ballads, popular song, legends, memorates, belief statements and folkloric material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some famous examples from this include the Irish fairylore and restless souls and spirits around [[Halloween]] such as the [[Banshee]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Banshee is one of the most popular classics to this day, known by many different names (for example, ''Badh'' commonly used in the south of Ireland).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51912602|title=The concept of the goddess|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|others=Billington, Sandra., Aldhouse-Green, Miranda J.

Other classics include [[leprechaun]]s, [[Fairy|fairies]], [[rainbow]]s, [[Cú Chulainn|Cu Chluain]], [[Children of Lir]], Dullahan (headless horsemen), Pookas, Changelings.

The word folklore in French means “picturesque but without importance or without deep significance”.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locating Irish folklore: tradition, modernity, identity|last=1955-|first=Ó Giolláin, Diarmuid,|date=2000|publisher=Cork University Press|year=|isbn=1859181694|location=Sterling, VA|pages=|oclc=43615310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland the word Folk Lore has deep meaning to its people and brings societies together, it is a word that has ideological significance in this country. In Ireland, folklore can be associated with the countryside, specifically the Irish speaking West, [[Aran Islands]], oral stories, the [[fiddle]], intimate settings. Folklore is also massively tied with traditional Irish music and dance for example the [[Riverdance|river dance]] can be tied to folklore in ways.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Samhain and Beltane are two traditions that are rooted in folklore, and are still in practice today. 

Samhain, (Celtic for “End of Summer") is an ancient Celtic tradition. It marks the end of the lighter half of the world (summer), and the beginning of the darker half (winter).   It is here where it was believed that the division between life and the after life was thinnest.  It was believed that this thinning allowed spirts to move between this world and the other.  The widely practice holiday of Halloween originates from Samhain. 

Another tradition rooted in folklore is Beltane.  Beltane is held on the first day of May.  This tradition is a celebration marking the beginning of summer.  During this tradition rituals were performed to protect both crops and livestock.  Large bonfires were lit serving as protection for grazing cattle.  Today Beltane festivals can be found in both Ireland and Scotland.

== Fairy lore ==
Fairy lore is a body of stories, anecdotes, beliefs and the likes of these that are relating to fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fairy_lore|title=fairy lore {{!}} Definition of fairy lore in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually contains superstitions and stories that were passed down throughout the generations.

There are different famous superstitions involving fairy lore. These superstitions mention that fairy forts and hawthorn trees, also known as fairy trees, are the places of residency of fairies. To tamper with these sites is seen as hugely disrespectful to the fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/Irish-FolkloreTraditional-Beliefs-and-Superstitions|title=Irish Folklore: Traditional Beliefs and Superstitions|work=Owlcation|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When tampered with, it could be seen an act of provocation towards these supernatural beings which would result in unexplainable consequences such as sickness, bad luck or even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yourirish.com/folklore/irish-fairy-trees|title=Superstitions &amp; Fairy trees in Ireland|last=Donnelly|first=Dave|date=2016-10-04|work=Your Irish Culture|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These encounters are recorded in Irish fairy tales as well as passed down by word of mouth.

Fairy stories include "The Field of Boliauns", "The Children Of Lir", "Finn MacCool", "The Fairy Well of Lagnanay" and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pp_SVHuVsFoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=fairies+in+irish+folktales&amp;ots=lqjuEOYLx0&amp;sig=Ftp3LaaP0JMO8QJOOTUvBGmch20&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fairies%20in%20irish%20folktales&amp;f=false|title=Fairy Folk Tales of Ireland|last=Yeats|first=William Butler|date=1998-03-02|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780684829524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different types of fairies in Irish fairy lore with different abilities and characteristics. These include the famous few such as the leprechaun, banshees, changelings and many others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The origin of these Irish fairies could be dated back to the ancient Celtic beliefs of pagan Gods and supernatural beings.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=nd9R6GQBB_0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438110370|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no  linear path that traces the development of fairy lore in Ireland from its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.celtic-weddingrings.com/fairy-stories/irish-fairies|title=Irish Fairies|website=www.celtic-weddingrings.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish fairy lore has influenced many English authors, such as [[Jonathan Swift]], who wrote [[Gulliver's Travels]] while living in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/Forgotten-Irish-Fairies|title=Forgotten Fairies of Irish Folklore|work=Owlcation|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seán Ó Súilleabháin (1903–1996) and the Irish Folklore Commission ==
Ó Súilleabháin was part of the [[Irish Folklore Commission]], ''Béaloideas''. Not long after the foundation of the commission he created two books for the collectors. The first, in 1937, a shorter volume in the Irish Language, ''Láimh-Leabhar Béaloideasa'', mainly used by collectors in the Irish speaking areas. In 1942 he wrote his more well-known volume ''A Handbook of Irish Folklore'' (published 1947). To this day his work serves as a great resource to collectors of Irish folklore and provides a wide outline of the traditions of Irish Folklore.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lysaght|first=Patricia|date=1998|title=Seán Ó Súilleabháin (1903-1996) and the Irish Folklore Commission|jstor=1500217|journal=Western Folklore|volume=57|issue=2/3|pages=137–151|doi=10.2307/1500217}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a booklet of topics, in both Irish and English, in 1937 to be used by teachers and school children in primary schools in the South of Ireland as part of the Schools' Scheme for the collection of folklore (1937-1938).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He focused on the native Gaelic tradition and the tradition of story-tellying. He played particular attention to the stories of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Fionn Mac Cumhail]] and the [[Fianna]], and looked into how stories were told in Irish and in other languages across Europe. His work was and still is very important in the study of Irish Folklore for the masses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Effects of Christianity on Irish folklore ==
When [[History of Christianity in Ireland|Christianity was first brought in Ireland]] during the 5th century by missionaries, they were not able to totally wipe out the pre-existing folklore and beliefs in God-like fairies. But folklore didn’t remain untouched, and the myths and [[Christian Beliefs|Christian beliefs]] were combined such that Irish folklore would “enforce Christian ideals but still remain as a concession to early fairy belief systems”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transceltic.com/irish/changelings-fairies-deities-and-saints-integration-of-irish-christianity-and-fairy-tale-belief|title=Changelings, Fairies, Deities, and Saints: The Integration of Irish Christianity and Fairy Tale Belief {{!}} Transceltic - Home of the Celtic nations|website=www.transceltic.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] altered the importance of some beliefs and define a new place for them in folklore. For example, fairies, who were previously perceived as God, became merely magical, and of much lesser importance. Along with it, a fusion of folklore legends and Christianity was witnessed. One of the major example of this is the existence of legends featuring both [[Saint Patrick]], a central figure in the Irish church, and [[Fairy|fairies]] (for example, “The Colloquy of the Ancients” is a dialogue between [[Saint Patrick]] and the ghost of Caeilte of the Fianna, an ancient clan of Celtic warriors).

All in all, the current Irish folklore shows a strong absorption of Christianity, including its lesson of morality and spiritual beliefs, creating a “singular brand of fairy tale tradition”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== The evolution of Irish folklore ==
Folklore is a part of national identity, and is evolving through time. During the 16th century, [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|the English conquest]] overthrew the traditional political and religious autonomy of the country. [[Great Famine (Ireland)|The Great famine of 1840’s]], and the deaths and emigration it brought, weakened a still powerful Gaelic culture, especially within the rural [[proletariat]], which was at the time the most traditional social grouping. At the time, intellectuals such as [[William Wilde|Sir William Wilde]] expressed concerns on the decay of traditional beliefs:

{{Quote|In the state of things, with depopulation the most terrific which any country ever experienced, on the one hand, and the spread of education, and the introduction of railroads, colleges, industrial and other educational schools, on the other – together with the rapid decay of our Irish bardic annals, the vestige of Pagan rites, and the relics of fairy charms were preserved, - can superstition, or if superstitious belief, can superstitious practices continue to exist?&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;}}

Moreover, in the last decades, capitalism has helped overcoming special spatial barriers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18747380|title=The condition of postmodernity: an enquiry into the origins of cultural change|last=1935-|first=Harvey, David,|date=1990|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631162941|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=18747380}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it easier for cultures to merge into one another (such as the amalgam between [[Samhain]] and [[Halloween]]).

All those events have led to a massive decline of native learned Gaelic traditions and [[Irish language]], and with Irish tradition being mainly an oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/Guide-to-Irish-Fairy-Tales|title=A Guide to Irish Folk Tales|work=Owlcation|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has led to a loss of identity and historical continuity, in a similar nature to [[Anomie|Durkheim's anomie]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Honko describes the current state of the Irish folklore as its “second life”.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Even though there is still a natural existence of folklore within its natural community, folklore material is now being used in other environments, such as marketing (with strategies suggesting tradition and authenticity for goods), movies and TV-shows (''[[The Secret of Kells]]'', mention of the [[Banshee]] are found in tv-shows such as [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|''Supernatural'']], ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' or ''[[Charmed]]''), books (the book series ''[[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]],'' the novel ''[[American Gods]]''...), contributing to the creation of a new body of Irish folklore.

'''Jalesveva Jayamahe Monument''' or can be locally referred to as '''Monjaya''' is a Statue of an [[Indonesian Navy]] officer wearing Ceremonial Service Dress, complete with his sword of honor, staring far to the sea as if he's ready to challenge the ocean's tide and storms. It represents the preparedness of the Indonesian Navy for glory. The statue is standing tall above a building, the total height of the building and the statue reaches 60.6 meters (approximately 198 feet and 9 inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sparkling.surabaya.go.id/jalesveva-jayamahe/|title=Jalesveva Jayamahe {{!}} Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Kota Surabaya|website=sparkling.surabaya.go.id|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jalesveva Jayamahe Monument representing the nation's future generation's optimism towards the accomplishment of Indonesian dream.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://monumenjalesvevajayamahe.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_13.html Travelling to Jalesveva Jayamahe Monument {{flagicon|Indonesia}}][[Indonesia|[[File:Flag_of_Indonesia.svg|link=|alt=Indonesia|23x23px]]]][[Indonesia|[[File:Flag_of_Indonesia.svg|link=|alt=Indonesia|23x23px]][[File:Flag_of_Indonesia.svg|link=|alt=Indonesia|23x23px]][[File:Flag_of_Indonesia.svg|link=|alt=Indonesia|23x23px]][[File:Flag_of_Indonesia.svg|link=|alt=Indonesia|23x23px]][[File:Flag_of_Indonesia.svg|link=|alt=Indonesia|23x23px]]]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''K Foundation Burn a Million Quid''''' was an action on 23 August 1994 in which the [[K Foundation]] (an art duo consisting of [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]]) [[burning money|burned cash]] in the amount of one million [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] in a disused boathouse on the [[Ardfin Estate]] on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1327533 |title= The Boathouse, Ardfin (C) Andrew Curtis  |website= Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate= 2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as [[The KLF]], one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s.

The incineration was recorded on a [[Hi-8]] video camera by K Foundation collaborator [[Alan Goodrick (Gimpo)|Gimpo]]. In August 1995, the film—''Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid''&lt;ref&gt;"[[wiktionary:quid|Quid]]" is a widely used [[British slang]] word meaning [[pounds sterling]] (singular or plural: "a quid", "a million quid").&lt;/ref&gt;—was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in debate about the burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period of 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant,&lt;ref name="BurningQuestion" /&gt; but in 2004 he admitted to the [[BBC]] that he regretted burning the money.&lt;ref name = "link"&gt;{{cite news|last=McKevitt |first=Greg |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3667901.stm |title=What Drummond did next |website= bbc.co.uk |date= 30 April 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "KLF Bill 2004, p27"&gt;{{cite news | title= KLF Bill: I regret burning £1m | work= [[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]] | location= [[Glasgow]] | date= 25 July 2004 | page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborator Chris Brook edited and compiled a book, ''K Foundation Burn A Million Quid'', which was published by Ellipsis Books in 1997. It compiles stills from the film, accounts of events and viewer reactions. One image in the book shows a [[brick|house brick]] that was manufactured from the fire's ashes.

==Background==
As [[The KLF]], [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]] were the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Bush |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-klf-mn0000074853/biography |title=The KLF &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had also enjoyed considerable success with their album ''[[The White Room]]'' and a number one hit single – "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" – as [[The Timelords]]. In February 1992, The KLF staged an incendiary performance at the [[BRIT Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, N., "The Arts: My name is Bill, and I'm a popaholic", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), 2 March 2000, p27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216222638/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=292 |title=Baa-nned!! KLF sheep chopped by BBC|date=22 February 1992|website=Library of Mu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retired from the music industry shortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion.&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203102148/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 |title=Who Killed The KLF?|last=Shaw|first=William|date=July 1992|website=Library of Mu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717003014/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309|title=Timelords gentlemen, please!|date=16 May 1992 |website=Library of Mu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian ''Big Issue'' writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the [[royalties]] they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds:{{quote|I think we made about £6m. We paid nearly half that in tax and spent the rest on production costs. When we stopped, the production costs stopped too, so over the next few months we amassed a surplus of cash still coming in from record sales; this amounted to about £1.8m. After tax we were left with about £1m. This was the money that later became the K Foundation fund for the 'advancement of kreation.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205204958/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=538 |title=Interview: the KLF's James Cauty|date=18 June 2003|last=Butler|first=Ben|website=Library of Mu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Initially The KLF's earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for struggling artists managed by the [[K Foundation]], Drummond and Cauty's new post-KLF art project, but, said Drummond, "We realised that struggling artists are meant to struggle, that's the whole point."&lt;ref name="database"&gt;Dower, John, and Greer, Dave, "The K Foundation: Why we burnt a million pounds", ''Thee Data Base'' fanzine, 1 March 1996; based on an interview with Drummond and Cauty on [[Subcity Radio]], [[Glasgow]], 3 November 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=416 link 1], [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/7535/KFound.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:45:01 link 2])&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the duo decided to create art ''with'' the money. ''Nailed to the Wall'' was the first piece of art produced by the Foundation, and the major piece in their planned [[art exhibition]], ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash''. Consisting of one million pounds in cash nailed to a pine frame, the piece was presented to the press on 23 November 1993 during the buildup to the Foundation's announcement of the "winner" of their "worst artist of the year award", the [[K Foundation art award]].&lt;ref name="KellyQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220174057/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=377|title=Million Dollar Bash|website=Library of Mu|last=Kelly|first=Danny |date=February 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DawsonScott"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051424/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=364|title=K Foundation tries to turn the art world on its head |date=28 November 1993|website=Library of Mu|last=Dawson Scott|first=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision and burning==
During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging ''Money: A Major Body of Cash'', but even old friend [[Jayne Casey]], director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. {{" '}}The [[Tate Liverpool|Tate, in Liverpool]], wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly",&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626150811/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=387 |title=Money to Burn|date=25 September 1994|last=Reid|first=Jim|website=Library of Mu }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former [[Soviet Union]] by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at [[Kilmainham Jail]] in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do."&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; Cauty: "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare."&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015083549/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=463|title=We didn't set out to make a film, we set out to burn 1m|website=Library of Mu |date=16 September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journey from deciding to burn the money to deciding ''how'' to burn the money to actually ''burning'' the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering ''Nailed To The Wall'' to the [[Tate Gallery]] as the "1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation." The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, the money would be burnt. A second idea was to hire [[Bankside Power Station]], "the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the [[South Bank]]", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF '[[guerrilla communication]]' style, "posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed To The Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt."&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt;

The K Foundation's final solution for their one-million-pound "problem" was rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having decided that making a public spectacle of the event would lessen its impact. On 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at [[Islay Airport]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] and took a ferry to the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], previously the scene of a [[wicker man]] burning ceremony by The KLF&lt;!-- which was captured in their movie ''[[The Rites of Mu]]''--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; Early in the morning of 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the act for ''[[The Observer]]'', and it was filmed on a Hi-8 video camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt guilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt;

The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. According to Drummond, only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404181323/http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0%2C%2C1220512%2C00.html |title='It's not haute cuisine' |date= 20 May 2004|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence of the burning. Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt;

==Film==
''Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid'' starts with a short description of the event, and then consists of Drummond and Cauty throwing £50 notes onto the fire. Burning the entire amount takes around 67 minutes. ''[[NME]]'' wrote:{{quote|At the start, Cauty is agitated and says he doesn't think the money will burn because it is too wet. The camera shows 20 thick bundles of £50 notes, each bundle containing £50,000 in new bank notes and sealed in cellophane. When the money ignites, Drummond starts to laugh as he and Cauty stand above a small fireplace throwing £50 notes on to the fire. Cauty constantly stokes the blaze with a large wooden plank and at one stage burns his hand on a flaming note. As the fire starts to dim, he scuttles around the floor sweeping stray notes into the flames. The cameraman shows a view from outside the building with charred £50 notes billowing out of the chimney.&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"/&gt;}}

In November 1995, the [[BBC]] aired an edition of the ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' documentary series about The K Foundation entitled ''A Foundation Course in Art''. Amongst the footage broadcast were scenes from ''Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid''. Thomas Sutcliffe, reviewing the programme in ''[[The Independent]]'', wrote:{{quote|The Omnibus film about this intriguing pair was in part a rear-guard action in their continuing battle for recognition (and a victory – for some people, after all, art is what appears on Omnibus). It was also a peculiarly modern fable about what constitutes an artist – will the artist's say-so do, or do you need the validation of the galleries? "You can't simply decide you're going to become an artist," said one gallery owner haughtily, which left you wondering how else the vocation might operate. A lottery system? Secret-ballot election?

For my money (meagre though it is), the video which recorded the laborious process of immolation was a decidedly intriguing work – rather more provoking than some contemporary work I've seen. For established galleries, the medium used (video, bank-notes, fire) is obviously an embarrassment, but if poverty of material is not to disqualify artworks (bricks or lard, say) why should the expense of material?&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, Thomas, ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) ISSN 0951-9467, 7 November 1995, TV section p24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Screening tour===
The first public screening of ''Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid'' was on Jura on 23 August 1995 – exactly one year after the burning. "We feel we should face them and answer their questions" said one of the duo.&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy, "From cash to ash", ''[[The Guardian]]'' (Manchester), 30 August 1995, page T.009. The words are attributed to the duo in general and not specifically attributed to Drummond or Cauty.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later an advert appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'', announcing a world tour of the film over the next 12 months at "relevant locations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131724/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=398 |date=4 September 1995|title=Why Did The K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?|website=Library of Mu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second screening was at [[In The City (festival)|In The City]] music industry convention on 5 September in [[Manchester]]. After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-and-answer session with the theme "Is It Rock'n'Roll?".&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who wants to be a millionaire? |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094902/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=400 |date=November 1995|last=Harris|first=John|website=Library of Mu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandallBurning"&gt;Sandall, Robert, "Money to burn", ''[[The Times]]'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460, 5 November 1995, Features p1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- In The City director (and former [[Factory Records]] boss) [[Tony Wilson]] told the duo:
{{quote|See, rock'n'roll, this should be throwing a [[television|TV]] set out the hotel window. That's rock'n'roll. But the point is that it's not your TV set it's the hotel's TV set. Whereas this was your money and maybe that's why it's not rock'n'roll. I think it's very art, but it's not popular enough. This was an art event. Rock'n'roll is popular, [[rave]] is popular. All great rock'n'roll is popular.&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"/&gt;}}
Perhaps in response to this, Drummond told [[Steve Lamacq]] that the money being theirs made it even more rock and roll. "The [[Keith Moon]] thing of driving your [[Rolls Royce]] into the swimming pool... that has always lived with me as like an ultimate rock'n'roll thing to do....

An unauthorised screening at the [[BBC Television Centre]] was curtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building.&lt;ref name="SandallBurning"/&gt;

On the weekend of 3 November 1995, the film was screened at several locations in [[Glasgow]],&lt;ref name="database"/&gt; including at football matches involving [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]; a planned screening at [[Barlinnie prison]] was cancelled after the [[Scottish Prison Service]] withdrew permission.&lt;ref name="KWhy"&gt;Gibb, Eddie and Sandground, Peter, "K-why?", ''The Times'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460, 5 November 1995, Features p1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fans to watch £1m go up in smoke|website=Library of Mu |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023062024/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=402 |date=4 November 1995|last=Cochrane|first=Lynn }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow's artistic community broadly seemed to welcome the screenings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Iain, "Barlinnie may get eyeful of Scotland's hottest million", ''The Times'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460, 29 October 1995, Home News p1&lt;/ref&gt; A further public screening on [[Glasgow Green]] on 5 November was announced by various newspapers,&lt;ref name="SandallBurning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheList"&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=401]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063409/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=401 |date=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no record of the showing having ever occurred. The K Foundation disappeared from Glasgow; they later issued a statement that on 5 November 1995 they had signed a "contract" at [[Cape Wrath]] in northern Scotland agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717020500/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 |date=17 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the K Foundation's reported moratorium, further national screenings of the film organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film; instead, they would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held in [[Bradford]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Liverpool]], [[Cheltenham Ladies College]], [[Eton College]], [[Bristol]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Glastonbury Tor]] and [[Brick Lane]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/bill-drummond-agent-provocateur-516269.html |title=Bill Drummond: Agent provocateur – Profiles, People |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brick Lane screening – on 8 December 1995 – had been previewed in ''NME'', and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned for a car park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to the basement of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions.&lt;ref name="faq_6_56_9"&gt;[http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?category_id=6#56] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105527/http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?category_id=6#56 |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''NME'' preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual [[frame (film)|frame]]s sold off to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=410 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129012706/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=410 |date=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.&lt;ref name="faq_6_56_10"&gt;[http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?category_id=6#56 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105527/http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?category_id=6#56 |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gimpo has continued to show the film at events such as [[literary festival]]s and [[underground film]] evenings over the years since the initial tour. On 23 August 2007, after a screening in Berlin, Germany, the DVD briefly disappeared. A few hours later, the film was released on several [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] trackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bezirke |url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2007/0825/feuilleton/0017/index.html |title=Nachrichten |publisher=BerlinOnline.de |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burning as a theme==
[[Image:Why did Ellipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid.gif|thumb|Ellipsis' K Foundation-style advert promoting the book ''K Foundation Burn A Million Quid'']]

[[Ritual]]istic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut album&amp;mdash;[[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]]'s ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]''&amp;mdash;by burning them in a Swedish field.&lt;ref&gt;"Thank You For The Music", ''New Musical Express'', 17 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', and celebrated in the song "[[Burn the Bastards]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Who Killed The JAMs?'' review, ''[[Sounds magazine|Sounds]]'' Magazine, 13 February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1991 [[Midsummer|summer solstice]], they burnt a {{convert|60|ft}} [[wicker man]]. This was chronicled in The KLF movie  ''[[The Rites of Mu]]''.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt;

As the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty threatened to burn the [[K Foundation art award]] prize money (Gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when, at the last moment, [[Rachel Whiteread]] accepted the prize).&lt;ref name="database"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717021843/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 |date=17 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventh K Foundation press advert they asked "What would you do with a million pounds? Burn it?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=355 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205031308/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=355 |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and analysis==
&lt;!--Some say that the money burning is in effect a very expensive [[publicity stunt]]. Drummond and Cauty can go down in history as the men who burnt a million pounds. As art, it is intended to make viewers think about money, and its relationship with life. Supporters ask if there is really a difference between spending money on useless objects or publicity, and making the loss of the money the actual publicity.

If they have introduced an important [[debate]] about the nature of money, art and fame, then some say the money might have been used wisely. Supporters argue that it is not true that they are fools who have lost their money, as by having "burnt a million pounds" on their [[Curriculum vitae|CV]]s they will be interesting to the media for the rest of their lives, and able to make it back easily. Just as the first line in every biography and [[obituary]] of [[Glen Milstead|Divine]] was "he once ate dog [[shit]] on film", the names of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty will always be followed by "the men who burnt a million pounds".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}--&gt;&lt;!-- we need a chronological account here --&gt;
Jim Reid's piece appeared in ''The Observer'' on 25 September 1994. This is "one of the most peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this."&lt;ref name = "Reid" /&gt;

The ''[[Daily Express]]'' ran the story on 1 October 1994. They reported that charred £50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=388 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205121439/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=388 |date=5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' followed with essentially the same story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning "[had] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry". £1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to [[Islay]] police: "Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|Customs and Excise]], who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. I asked him if it was his. He said he would get in touch with his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=389 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015091541/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=389 |date=15 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media returned to the story in earnest in October and November 1995, previewing and then reviewing ''Foundation Course In Art'', and reporting on the K Foundation's tour screening ''Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid''.

An October 1995 feature quoted [[Kevin Hull]], the BBC documentary maker responsible for the ''Omnibus'' item, saying he had found "the boys rather depressed, and almost in a state of shock". "Every day I wake up and I think 'Oh God, I've burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it's wrong{{' "}}, Cauty told him.&lt;ref name="TheList"/&gt;

A piece in ''The Times'' on 5 November 1995, coinciding with the Glasgow screenings, reported that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the money or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded "The K Foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the responsibilities of those who possess it. And what could be more artistic than that?"&lt;ref name="KWhy"/&gt; In the same issue, the newspaper's [[K Foundation art award]] witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all "entertaining, and satirically quite sharp", but "the art world has chosen not to think [of it as art].... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's savings along the way, other artists, notably [[Yves Klein]] and [[Chris Burden]], have been here before."&lt;ref name="SandallBurning"/&gt;

''The Guardian''{{'s}} TV reviewer was sceptical. "Snag is, the K men have always dealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion, so nobody quite believes they really burned the money. And if they did, they must be nuts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=407 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303061931/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=407 |date=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later reaction===
In the following years, the burning was mentioned regularly in the press, with Drummond and Cauty often relegated to a cultural status of "the men who burnt a million quid".

A February 2000 article in ''The Observer'' newspaper again insisted that the duo really had burnt one million pounds. "It wasn't a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. 'I knew it was real,' a long-time friend and associate of his group The KLF tells me, 'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they've never really been the same since{{' "}}.&lt;ref name = "BurningQuestion"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3962686,00.html |title=Burning question &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=486 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717035639/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=486 |date=17 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 listener poll by [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] saw The KLF/K Foundation placed second after [[The Who]] in a list of "rock excesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes |first=Anthony |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-who-top-rocks-hall-of-shame-6167086.html |title=The Who top rock's hall of shame - News - Music |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2004-06-20 |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond's former protegé [[Julian Cope]] was unimpressed, claiming that Drummond still owed him money. "He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/drude/qa/musicians.php |title=Julian Cope presents Head Heritage &amp;#124; Julian Cope &amp;#124; Q&amp;A 2000Ce &amp;#124; Cope Musicians &amp; Cohorts |publisher=Headheritage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On 17 September 1997, a new film, ''This Brick'', was premiered. The film consisted of one three-minute shot of a brick made from the ashes of the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the [[Barbican Centre]] prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as [[2K (band)|2K]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=456 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303062343/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=456 |date=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 1997, ''K Foundation Burn A Million Quid'' ({{ISBN|0-9541656-5-9}}, {{ISBN|1-899858-37-7}} paperback) was published. The book, by Chris Brook and Gimpo, contains stills from the film and transcriptions of various Q&amp;A sessions from the tour. It also includes a timeline of K Foundation activity and sundry essays including one from [[Alan Moore]]. Publisher Ellipsis promoted the book with an advert modelled on those of the K Foundation – "Why did Ellipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?" they asked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellipsis.com/k/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425235437/http://www.ellipsis.com/k/index.html |date=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling ''The Observer'' in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only "an expensive clinic" could cure him.&lt;ref name="BurningQuestion"/&gt;  By 2004, however, he had admitted to the [[BBC]] the difficulty of explaining his decision.&lt;ref name="link"/&gt; "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand."&lt;ref name="KLF Bill 2004, p27"/&gt;

The '''killing off''' of a character is a device in [[fiction]], whereby a character dies, but the story continues. The term, frequently applied to [[television]], [[film]] and chronological series, often denotes an untimely or unexpected death motivated by factors beyond the storyline.

In productions featuring actors, the unwillingness or inability of an actor to continue with the production for financial or other reasons (including illness, death, or producers' unwillingness to retain an actor) may lead to that character being "killed off" or removed from the storyline.

==Examples==
===Television===
Because of the episodic format of television shows, audience feedback and approval is often a factor in whether or not a character is killed off. [[Damon Lindelof]], executive producer of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', has been quoted as saying that despite the widespread hate for [[Nikki and Paulo]], "We had a plan when we introduced them, and we didn't get to fully execute that plan. But when the plan is executed, [they] will be iconic characters on the show."&lt;ref name=ew&gt;Jensen, Jeff &amp; Snierson, Dan, (February 8, 2007) "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20011203_3,00.html 'Lost' and Found]," ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved on October 19th 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In an example of a character being killed off as a result of an actor leaving the show, [[Raymond Cruz]]'s character [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Tuco Salamanca|Tuco Salamanca]] on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' was killed off because he found the part too difficult to play.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Raymond (March 17, 2009) "{{cite web |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/2009/03/raymond-cruz-interview.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022195550/http://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/2009/03/raymond-cruz-interview.php |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}" ''[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]''. retrieved 19 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may be killed off when the actors die. [[John Ritter]]'s character in ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' was written to have died off screen after Ritter himself died during taping of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/05/arts/the-tv-watch-no-simple-rules-for-dealing-with-death.html|title=THE TV WATCH; No Simple Rules For Dealing With Death|last=Stanley|first=Alexandra|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 5, 2003|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] children's character [[Farfur]] (a [[Mickey Mouse]] [[lookalike]]) is an example of a character "killed off" for political reasons in 2007. After the program received criticism from some government ministers in both Palestine and [[Israel]] for espousing anti-Israeli sentiments, the Farfur character was killed off. Even his death, at the hands of an "Israeli agent", making Farfur a "martyr", was similarly politicised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6257594.stm BBC News: "Hamas 'Mickey Mouse' killed off] retrieved 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priceline.com]] apparently killed off its lead character, the "Priceline Negotiator" (portrayed by longtime company spokesman [[William Shatner]]), in an [[Super Bowl advertising|advertisement]] during [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Lydia (January 29, 2012).

''The Daily Mail''. Retrieved January 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The killing off, however, turned out to be a hoax, as Shatner returned with his protégé (portrayed by [[Kaley Cuoco]]) in later commercials.

[[Brian Griffin]], the talking dog on ''[[Family Guy]]'', was killed off in the [[Family Guy (season 12)|Season 12 episode]], "[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]" and was replaced with a new dog, Vinny, voiced by [[Tony Sirico]]. Fans of the show were devastated and started a petition in order to bring back Brian. However, Brian was brought back to life two episodes later, in the Christmas episode, "[[Christmas Guy]]", where [[Stewie Griffin]] travels back in time to prevent Brian from being struck by the car that killed him. Creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] said on [[Twitter]] shortly after the episode aired, "And thus endeth our warm, fuzzy, holiday lesson: Never take those you love for granted, or they can be gone in a flash. I mean, you didn't think we'd kill off Brian did you? Jesus we'd have to be fucking high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/family-guy-brian-griffin-brought-back-to-life-as-seth-macfarlane-admits-hoax-9007251.html|title=Family Guy: Brian Griffin brought back to life as Seth MacFarlane admits hoax|last=Blundy|first=Rachel|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later revealed in the [[Family Guy (season 14)| season 14]] episode "[[Inside Family Guy]]" that he was killed off so that he could work on a remake of ''[[Old Yeller]]'', according to [[Lois Griffin|Lois]].

[[Maude Flanders]], a recurring character and the first wife of [[Ned Flanders]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', was killed off in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|Season 11 episode]], ''[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]'' where she is killed by a T-shirt cannon at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Speedway when [[Homer]] ducks at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. This kill off was decided by the show's producers after Maude's voice actress, [[Maggie Roswell]], left The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], which airs The Simpsons. [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]] voiced Maude between 1999 and 2000 and many other of Roswell's characters during this period. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with producers to allow her to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost.

When voice actor and Scientologist [[Isaac Hayes]] departed ''[[South Park]]'' over the show's creators criticism of [[Scientology]] in the episode [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]], his character ([[Chef (South Park)|Chef]]) was killed off in the episode ''[[The Return of Chef]]''. For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot.

===Comic books===
{{main|Comic book death}}
{{see also|Women in Refrigerators}}
Death is a frequently used dramatic device in comic book fiction, and in particular [[superhero fiction]]. Unlike stories in television or film, character deaths are rarely by unforeseen behind-the-scenes events, as there is no analogous situation to having actors portraying characters. Instead, characters are typically killed off as part of the story, or occasionally by editorial mandate to generate publicity for a title. Teasers may hint at characters' deaths for an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8590902/Death-of-Spider-Man-the-latest-in-comic-book-trend-for-shocking-readers.html|title=Death of Spider-Man the latest in comic book trend for shocking readers|last=Allen|first=Nick|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factors often mean that these changes are not permanent. Due to extremely long print runs, the popularity of these characters (with writers and fans) and occasionally rights issues for using the character in licensed adaptations, characters are often brought back to life by later writers. This can happen either as a depiction of their literal resurrection or by [[retcon]], a revision which changes earlier continuity and establishes the character not to have died in the first place. This phenomenon is known as the [[comic book death]]. Killing off a main character such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]] or [[Captain America]] can often lead to an uptick in publicity for a comic book, as well as high sales for the story in which they are inevitably brought back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=45885|title=In Your Face Jam: Getting Over Death|last=White|first=Brett|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have also criticized the trend for killing off supporting characters, particularly when female characters are killed off brutally to elicit a strong reaction in the male protagonist. This is known as the [[Women in Refrigerators]] trope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/gail-simone-batgirl-movement-red-sonja-women/#/0|title=Gail Simone talks 'Batgirl,' 'The Movement,' 'fierce' women in comics|last=Hennon|first=Blake|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, the [[Death of Gwen Stacy]], long-time girlfriend of [[Spider-Man]], caused great shock and long-lasting controversy among fans.

{{Main article|Konstantin Stanislavski}}
[[File:Stanislavski as Colonel Vershinin in Chekhov's The Three Sisters.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konstantin Stanislavski]] as Vershinin in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''.]]
This article offers a chronological '''list of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski'''. It does not include theatrical productions in which [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] only acted.

Until he was thirty three, Stanislavski appeared only as an [[Amateur theatre|amateur]] onstage and as a [[Theatre director|director]], as a result of his family's discouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 21, 24) and Carnicke (2000, 11). The prospect of becoming a professional actor was [[taboo]] for someone of Stanislavski's [[social class]]; actors had an even lower [[social status]] in Russia than in the rest of Europe, having only recently been [[Russian serfdom|serfs]] and the [[property]] of the [[nobility]].&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twenty five, he helped to establish a Society of Art and Literature, which aimed to unite amateur and professional actors and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack (1950, 52, 55–56).&lt;/ref&gt; His professional career began in 1896 when he co-founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] (MAT) with [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 61–64).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, he created a series of studios whose aims were primarily [[Theatre pedagogy|pedagogical]] but which also presented public performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; This list of productions directed by Stanislavski includes amateur, professional, and studio productions.

When the sources disagree about the exact date of a production's [[Premiere|première]], that given in the most recent biography of Stanislavski—Jean Benedetti's ''Stanislavski: His Life and Art'' (1988, revised and expanded 1999)—is listed here, with the alternative date detailed in the footnotes. Prior to 14 February 1918, the [[Julian calendar]] was in use in Russia, after which the [[Gregorian calendar]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;In the 19th century, the difference between the two calendars was twelve days; in the 20th, 13 days; see Gauss (1999, 6).&lt;/ref&gt; The details of productions staged before that change are given in both [[Old Style and New Style dates]].

{{Literature}}
'''Literary adaptation''' is the [[adaptation (arts)|adapting]] of a literary source (e.g. a novel, short story, poem) to another genre or medium, such as a film, stage play, or video game.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It can also involve adapting the same literary work in the same genre or medium just for different purposes, e.g. to work with a smaller cast, in a smaller venue (or on the road), or for a different demographic group (such as adapting a story for children). Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case.

It also appeals because it obviously works as a story; it has interesting characters, who say and do interesting things. This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work, e.g. film, stage play, teleplay, as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult. To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensions—concept, character, story, dialogue, and action—is an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent.

Perhaps most importantly, especially for producers of the screen and stage, an adapted work is more bankable; it represents considerably less risk to investors, and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains. This is because:
* It has already attracted a following.
* It clearly works as a literary piece in appealing to a broad group of people who care.
* Its title, author, characters, etc. may be a franchise in and of themselves already.

==Film==
{{main|Film adaptation}}
Works of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry. Some of the earliest examples come from the work of [[Georges Méliès]], who pioneered many film techniques. In 1899, he released two adaptations — ''Cinderella'' based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] story of the same name and ''[[King John (1899 film)|King John]]'', the first known film to be based on the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The 1900 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes Baffled]]'', directed by [[Arthur Marvin]] featured [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s detective character [[Sherlock Holmes]] intruding upon a pseudo-supernatural burglary. The film, considered the first detective movie, ran for only 30 seconds and was originally intended to be shown in hand-cranked [[Mutoscope]] machines.

Méliès' 1902 original science-fiction feature ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' was based loosely on two popular novels of the time: [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=Greatest&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Dirks |title=A Trip to The Moon |work= FilmSite.org |url=http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html |accessdate=2007-01-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117090347/http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html| archivedate= 17 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of many adaptations of the [[Brothers Grimm]] tale ''[[Snow White]]'' was [[Snow White (1902 film)|released in 1902]] while the earliest surviving copy is [[Snow White (1916 film)|the 1916 version]]. 1903 saw the release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1903 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' directed by [[Cecil Hepworth]] and [[Percy Stow]], the first movie adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s children's book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0000420|title=Alice in Wonderland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first feature-length film to be shot entirely in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] was [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s first assignment, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'', in 1914, which was the first of three movie versions (all directed by DeMille) based on [[Edwin Milton Royle]]'s [[play (theatre)|play]] [[The Squaw Man (play)|of the same name]]. Since the early days of the genre, major films have been largely adapted:
* Novels: [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]] (1939), [[From Here to Eternity]] (1953), and [[The Godfather]] (1972) were all adapted from novels of the same name.
* Plays: [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] (1942), [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|Streetcar Named Desire]] (1951), and [[Equus (film)|Equus]] (1977) were all adapted from stage plays.
* Short stories: [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]] (1947), [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]] (1961), [[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (film)|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]] (1968), [[The Shawshank Redemption|Shawshank Redemption]] (1994), and [[Brokeback Mountain]] (2005) were all made from short stories.
The most celebrated of the early adaptations is [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'', a 1924 adaptation of the 1899 novel ''[[McTeague]]'' by naturalist writer [[Frank Norris]]. The director intended to film every aspect of the novel in great detail, resulting in a 9½-hour epic feature. At studio insistence, the film was cut down to two hours and was considered a flop upon its theatrical release. It has since been restored to just over four hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/03/entertainment/ca-39909|title=A 'Greed' More as Stroheim Had Intended|last=THOMAS|first=KEVIN|date=1999-12-03|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. 

One book that has been adapted very frequently (in one form or another) is [[Charles Dickens]]' Christmas story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', which has around 20 film adaptations to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collider.com/a-christmas-carol-adaptations-ranked/|title='A Christmas Carol' Adaptations Ranked from "Bah Humbug!" to "God Bless Us Everyone!"|date=2015-12-25|work=Collider|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
From a legal standpoint, when a literary source has not passed into the [[public domain]], rights must be arranged for the adaptation to be performed legally. Plagiarism occurs in every [[genre]], and throughout history, but such literary rights violations can be challenged in court. In the case of Hollywood films, judgments for the [[plaintiff]] can run into the millions of dollars, but these have typically been for outright theft of a screenplay idea rather than for fraudulent adaptations (see ''[[Buchwald v. Paramount]]'').

Because of the importance of telling a story with a limited number of [[Character (arts)|character]]s, short stories often make better sources for adaptable material than do novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://screencraft.org/2015/11/13/5-reasons-short-stories-are-easier-to-adapt-than-novels/|title=5 Reasons Short Stories Are Easier to Adapt Than Novels|date=2015-11-13|work=ScreenCraft|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the stage, in addition, theater audiences tend to accept and prefer works of a more conceptual, thought-based nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/what-fences-misses-about-adapting-plays-for-the-screen|title=What “Fences” Misses About Adapting Plays for the Screen|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning their preferences need to be considered when selecting a work for adaptation, but also when determining how best to adapt it. The stage imposes physical limits of size and technology. Not every [[illusion]] that can be made to appear real on the [[movie screen]] can be made to appear so on stage.

[[File:0040 Grabstein des Gaius Volumnius und seiner Frau Altes Museum anagoria.JPG |thumb|Tombstone of Gaius Volumnius and his wife; Upper Italy; 1–50 CE]]
'''[[Funeral|Funerary]] [[relief]]s of married couples''' were common in [[Roman funerary art]]. They are one of the most common funerary portraits found on surviving [[Freedman#Ancient Rome|freedmen]] reliefs. By the fourth century, a portrait of a couple on a [[Ancient Roman sarcophagi|sarcophagus]] from the empire did not necessarily signify the burial of two spouses but instead demonstrated the importance of the material bond.

== Via Statilia relief ==

An example of a Late [[Roman Republic]] double portrait of a man and a woman, a husband and wife, that once decorated a tomb of the Via Statilia in Rome. The wife and husband were probably former slaves because [[Slavery in ancient Rome]] was common. It has been estimated that Italy alone had about two million slaves. Some slaves gained freedom in return for their service, while other died as slaves in service of their original or new owner. As slaves, couples had no legal standing, after they had been freed former slaves became people in the eye of the law. Therefore, freedmen and freedwomen would portray themselves as married couple on their tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, S, Fred. A History of Roman Art: Clark Baxter, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lucius Antistius Sarculo and Antistia Plutia ==

[[File:BM GR 1858,0819.2 - 01.JPG|thumbnail|right|Marble funerary relief of Lucius Antistius Sarculo and his wife Antistia Plutia. Roman, about 30–10 BC. Found in Rome. GR 1858,0819.2 (Sculpture 2275)]]

This relief originally was part of the funerary monument of Lucius Antistius Sarculo. This relief consists of two figures: a free-born Roman priest of the [[Salii|Salian]] order, and his wife and freedwoman (former slave) Antisia Plutia.

The relief is typical of the realistic style with the lined eyes, the hollowed cheeks and the prominent ears of the Antistius, along with other characteristic. Furthermore, the couple’s hairstyles indicate a date towards the end of the first century BC. Antistius' hair is cut close to his head, emphasizing his retreating hairline. Antistia's hair, drawn back into a small [[bun (hairstyle)|bun]], with some curls brought forward and a small topknot at the front of the head, follows exactly the hairstyle of the [[Livia]], wife of Emperor [[Augustus]] (27 BCE – 14 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/marble_funerary_relief.aspx Marble funerary relief of Lucius Antistius Sarculo and Antistia Plutia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
In Rakowitz's project return he reopens his grandfather's import and export business. The company initially functioned as a drop box. In 2005 it became a packaging center and sorting facility. Members of the Iraqi diaspora community and interested citizens were invited to send things to be shipped free of charge to recipients in Iraq. Rakowitz also wanted to explore the possibility of importing things clearly labeled "Product of Iraq"; he chose dates which were legendary{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} in Iraq, with a yield of over 600 varieties. The first batch he tried to ship died in Syria but the second made its way through different nations and different customs; the dates became a representative for an Iraq refugee traveling to a new life.When they finally made it to Brooklyn there people were eager to try them, this fruit that caused so many problems to get there asked questions and brought up memories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

One of his more notable{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} projects is Enemy Kitchen. The project began in 2004; in it Rakowitz compiles Baghdad recipes with the help of his mother and then teaches them to public audiences. The first time this project was performed was with students who lived in Chelsea and went to the Hudson Guild Community Center. With the project in cooking and eating the food, it opens up the lines of communication allowing, in this case, the students to attach the word Iraq to food as a representative of culture and discuss it. The students discussed the war and compare it to their own lives. Later this project also included a [[food truck]] that roamed around Chicago. The food truck itself gives home to the Iraqi ex-pat community and is another way of bringing art down to a level that involves and interacts with people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-09/entertainment/ct-ae-0311-michael-rakowitz-20120308_1_art-project-smart-museum-conceptual-art Michael Rakowitz interview: Enemy Kitchen food truck - tribunedigital-chicagotribune, March 9, 2012, by Christopher Borrelli]&lt;/ref&gt; Rakowitz says, "I see the truck as a potentially healing gesture, not that it has to be. I don't have delusions that it will perform the hard work of healing traumas. I do believe there can be an aesthetic of good intentions, but I'm leery of saying what those are. No, I'm not going to tell anyone it's art."{{Cite quote|date=July 2016}}

Rakowitz about how he sees his art: "As an artistic gesture I try to make an unlikely thing happen, and the impossible becomes possible. It's art because it's impossible for this to exist in the world."{{Cite quote|date=July 2016}}

Tne '''National Art Schools''' (Escuelas Nacionales de Arte) of Cuba is one of the most important educational institutions of the Cuban nation and has been declared as "National Monument".


[[Cuba]]'s National Art Schools (Escuelas Nacionales de Arte, now known as the [[Instituto Superior de Arte]]) are considered by historians to be among the most outstanding architectural achievements of the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, John A., ''Revolution of Forms - Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools'', introduction p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; 

These innovative, organic [[Catalan vault|Catalan-vaulted]] brick and [[terra-cotta]] structures were built on the site of a former [[country club]] in the far western [[Havana]] suburb of Cubanacán, which used to be Havana's "Beverly Hills" and was then mainly reserved for Communist Party officials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moon.com/destinations/cuba/havana/sights-playa/cubanacan&lt;/ref&gt; The schools were conceived and founded by [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] in 1961, and they reflect the utopian optimism and revolutionary exuberance of the early years of the Cuban Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, D. (2000), ''World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: The Americas'', Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Over their years of active use, the schools served as the primary incubator for Cuba’s artists, musicians, actors and dancers.

[[File:WMF Cuba Art Schools.ogv|thumb|[[World Monuments Fund]] video on conservation of the National Schools of Art]]
By 1965, however, the art schools and their architects fell out of favor as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-inspired [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] forms became standard in Cuba. Additionally, the schools were subjected to accusations that their design was incompatible with the Cuban Revolution. These factors resulted in the schools’ near-complete decommissioning and the departure of two of their three architects. Never fully completed, the complex of buildings lay in various stages of use and abandonment, some parts literally overgrown by the jungle until preservation efforts began in the first decade of the 21st century. The schools’ legacy was eventually brought to light by regional and international architectural journals in the 1980s, piquing the curiosity of observers both internationally and within Cuba through the 1990s. This growing interest reached its apex in 1999 with the publication of the book ''Revolution of Forms - Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools'', by John Loomis, a California-based architect, professor, and author. Following the publication of ''Revolution of Forms'', the schools attracted even greater international attention and in 2000 they were nominated for the [[World Monuments Fund]] Watch List. In November 2010, the National Art Schools were officially recognized as national monuments by the Cuban Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/project/national-art-schools|title=NATIONAL ART SCHOOLS - World Monuments Fund|work=wmf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are currently being considered for inclusion on the World Heritage list of sites which have "outstanding universal value" to the world.&lt;ref name="unescoworldheritagecentre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1798/|title=National Schools of Art, Cubanacán|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba’s National Art Schools have inspired a series of art installations under the name of ''Utopia Posible'' by the Cuban artist [[Felipe Dulzaides]], the documentary film ''[[Unfinished Spaces]]'' by Alysa Nahmias and Ben Murray, and an opera directed by [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] entitled ''Revolution of Forms'' (named after John Loomis' book)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutionofforms.com|title=Revolution of Forms: Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools|work=revolutionofforms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Charles Koppleman.

==Conceptualization of Cuba's National Art Schools==

In January 1961, the Cuban revolutionary leaders Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, enjoyed a drink after they finished a game of golf at Havana’s formerly exclusive Country Club Park, pondered the future of a country club whose members had all fled the country. The [[Cuban Literacy Campaign]] had just been launched, and with the inspiration of extending the program’s success into a wider cultural arena, Guevara proposed the creation of a complex of tuition-free art schools to serve talented young people from all over the [[Third World]]. He conceived of the schools as highly experimental and conceptually advanced to serve the creation of a “new culture” for the “new man”. An innovative program called for innovative architecture, and Castro saw the Cuban architect Ricardo Porro as being that architect who could deliver such architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba’s National Art Schools represented an attempt to reinvent architecture in the same manner that the Cuban Revolution aspired to reinvent society. Through their designs, the architects sought to integrate issues of culture, ethnicity, and place into a revolutionary formal composition hitherto unknown in architecture.&lt;ref name="wmf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/dig-deeper/article/castros-dream|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013184855/http://www.wmf.org/dig-deeper/article/castros-dream|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-10-13|title=Castro's Dream - World Monuments Fund|work=wmf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design of the five schools==
The design of the National Art Schools, created by [[Ricardo Porro]], [[Roberto Gottardi]], and [[Vittorio Garatti]], ran counter to the dominant [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of the time. The three architects saw the International Style as the architecture of [[capitalism]] and sought to recreate a new architecture in the image of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. These critiques of [[modern architecture|modernism]] existed in a broader context of critique and are considered to be notable additions to the spectrum of innovative architecture from the period. Architects such as [[Hugo Häring]], [[Bruno Zevi]], [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]], and [[Alvar Aalto]], not to mention [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], all practiced on the margins of mainstream modern architecture. For Porro, Gottardi, and Garatti, this international response to modernism mixed with more region-specific expressions of Hispanic and Latin American identity (long after [[Gaudí]] but sharing his [[Catalan people|Catalan]] influence) in the post-WWII world.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The architects set up their design studio on the site of the former country club. They decided that there would be three guiding principles for the design of the art schools. The first principle was that the architecture for the schools would be integrated with the widely varied, unusual landscape of the golf course. The second and third principles were derived from material necessity. The [[US embargo against Cuba]], begun in 1960, had made the importation of [[rebar]] and [[Portland cement]] very costly. The architects therefore decided to use locally produced brick and [[terracotta]] tile, and for the constructive system they would use the [[Catalan vault]] with its potential for [[Organic architecture|organic form]]. When Fidel Castro viewed the plans for the art schools, he praised their design, saying that the complex would be “the most beautiful academy of arts in the whole world”.&lt;ref&gt;Fidel Castro Ruiz, quoted in ''La mas Hermosa academia de artes de todo el mundo'', Noticias de Hoy, 4 May 1963&lt;/ref&gt; There were five art schools within the academy: the School of [[Modern Dance]], the School of [[Plastic Arts]], the School of [[Dramatic arts|Dramatic Arts]], the School of [[Music]], and the School of [[Ballet]].

===School of Modern Dance – Ricardo Porro===
[[File:Loomis school modern dance.jpg|thumb|School of Modern Dance, [[Ricardo Porro]]]]

Porro conceived the modern dance school’s plan as a sheet of glass that had been violently smashed and fragmented into shifting shards, symbolic of the revolution's violent overthrow of the old order.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments gather around an entry plaza - the locus of the "impact" - and develop into an urban scheme of linear, though non-[[Rectilinear style|rectilinear]], shifting streets and courtyards. The entry arches form a hinge around which the library and administrative bar rotate away from the rest of the school. The south side of the fragmented plaza is defined by rotating dance pavilions, paired around shared dressing rooms. The north edge, facing a sharp drop in terrain, is made by two linear bars, containing classrooms, that form an obtuse angle.  At the culmination of the angular procession, farthest from the entry, where the plaza once again compresses is the celebrated form of the performance theater.

===School of Plastic Arts – Ricardo Porro===
[[File:Loomis school plastic arts.jpg|thumb|School of Plastic Arts, [[Ricardo Porro]]]]

The concept for this school is intended to evoke an archetypal African village, creating an organic urban complex of streets, buildings and open spaces.  The studios, oval in plan, are the basic cell of the complex.  Each one was conceived as a small arena theater with a central skylight to serve students working from a live model. The studios are organized along two arcs, both of which are curving colonnaded paths. Lecture rooms and offices are accommodated in a contrasting blocklike plan that is partially wrapped by and engaged with the colonnaded path. Ideas of gender and ethnicity converge in the curvilinear forms and spaces of [[Plastic Arts]]. Most notable is how the organic spatial experience of the curvilinear ''paseo archetectonico'' delightfully disorients the user not being able to fully see the extent of the [[magical realism|magic realist]] journey being taken.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

===School of Dramatic Arts – Roberto Gottardi===
[[File:Loomis school dramatic arts.jpg|thumb|School of Dramatic Arts, [[Roberto Gottardi]]]]

The School of Dramatic Arts is urban in concept, as are Porro’s two schools. Dramatic Arts is organized as a very compact, axial, cellular plan around a central plaza amphitheater. Its inward-looking nature creates a closed fortress-like exterior. The amphitheater, fronting the unbuilt theater at what now is the entrance, is the focal point of all the subsidiary functions, which are grouped around it. [[Circulation (architecture)|Circulation]] takes place in the narrow leftover [[wikt:interstice|interstice]]s, open to the sky like streets, between the positive volumes of the masonry cells. Winding more or less concentrically through the complex, circulation negates the axiality and generalized symmetry that organize the plan. This presents an interesting contradiction between the formal and the experiential. While quite ordered in plan, the experience of walking through the complex is random and episodic.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===School of Music - Vittorio Garatti===
The School of Music is constructed as a serpentine ribbon 330 meters long, embedded in and traversing the contours of the landscape approaching the river. The scheme and its ''paseo arquitectonico'' begin where a group of curved brick planters step up from the river. This path submerges below ground as the band is joined by another layer containing group practice rooms and another exterior passage, shifted up in section from the original band. Displacements are read in the roofs as a series of stepped, or terraced, planters for flowers. This 15m wide tube, broken into two levels, is covered by undulating, layered [[Catalan vault]]s that emerge organically from the landscape, traversing the contours of the ground plane. Garatti's meandering ''paseo arquitectonico'' presents an ever-changing contrast of light and shadow, of dark subterranean and brilliant tropical environments.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

===School of Ballet – Vittorio Garatti===
[[File:Loomis school ballet.jpg|thumb|School of Ballet, [[Vittorio Garatti]]]]

From the top of the golf course’s ravine, one looks down upon the ballet school complex, nestled into the descending gorge. The plan of the school is articulated by a cluster of domed volumes, connected by an organic layering of [[Catalan vault]]s that follow a winding path. There are at least five ways to enter the complex. The most dramatic entrance starts at the top of the ravine with a simple path bisected by a notch to carry rainwater.  As one proceeds, the terra cotta cupolas, articulating the major programmatic spaces, emerge floating over lush growth. The path then descends down into the winding subterranean passage that links the classrooms and showers, three dance pavilions, administration pavilions, library and the [[Pantheon, London|Pantheon]]-like space of the performance theater. The path also leads up onto its roofs which are an integral part of Garatti's ''paseo arquitectonico''. The essence of the design is not found in the plan but in the spatial experience of the school's choreographed volumes that move with the descending ravine.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the National Art Schools==
The 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] provoked an international incident that posed serious challenges for Cuba. In addition, setbacks across the Socialist world (the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, the coup against Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella in 1965, the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the newly launched guerrilla war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]), marked a turning point and created a sense of isolation and embattlement in Cuba facing the [[Cold War]] alone in the [[Caribbean]]. Production and defense became primary national priorities and the population was militarized. The government began to consider the National Art Schools to be extravagant and out of scale with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the art schools slowed down, as more and more of the workforce was now redirected to areas considered of greater national priority.  The architects were also encountering criticism. Many in the Ministry of Construction did not trust the Catalan vault as a structural system. There was also a certain amount of envy on the part of many of the ministry bureaucrats toward the comparatively privileged conditions under which Porro, Gottardi, and Garrati were working.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.113&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions would prove to escalate.

As Cuba’s political environment evolved from one of [[utopian]] optimism into an evermore doctrinaire structure, following models provided by the Soviet Union, the National Art Schools found themselves as subjects of repudiation. The schools were criticized for ideological errors. The architects themselves were accused of being "elitists" and "cultural aristocrats," with "egocentric" bourgeois formations.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Segre, ''Diez Años de Arquitectura Revolucionaria en Cuba'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The constructive system, the Catalan vault, was now criticized as a "primitive" technology that represented "backward" values of the capitalist past. The Afro-Cuban imagery of the School of Plastic Arts was attacked as representative of “hypothetical Afro-Cuban origins” which had been “erased by slavery” and therefore held no relevance of a society advancing toward a culturally uniform socialist future.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Soviet-style functionalism vs. organic revolutionary architecture===
At the same time, these ideological issues also served to mask a very non-ideological drama.  The National Art Schools and their architects were caught in a power struggle, with an architect named Antonio Quintana playing a major role. Quintana was a staunch modernist who, as the 1960s unfolded, embraced a [[Functionalist (architecture)|Functionalist]] model for architecture, a model that advocated massive prefabricated production – precisely the model upon which architecture was based in the Soviet Union. This model was completely at odds with the site-specific, craft-oriented, formal poetry of the National Art Schools. Quintana quite successfully, and quickly, maneuvered his way up through the ranks of the Ministry of Construction to ever increasing power. His growing authority and outspoken criticism of the National Art Schools helped to determine their fate. In July 1965, the National Art Schools were declared finished in their various stages of completion and incompletion, and construction came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1965, [[Hugo Consuegra]] wrote a courageous defense of the National Art Schools, and their architects, that was published in the journal ''Arquitectura Cuba''. This article was the last attempt of this period to reconcile the schools with the values of the Cuban Revolution. Consuegra described the formal complexities, spatial ambiguities, and disjunctive qualities of the schools not as in contradiction with but as characteristic and positive values of the Cuban Revolution. However, Consuegra’s courageous defense proved to be in vain, and as the schools fell out of institutional favor, they were slowly abandoned. The Schools of Modern Dance and Plastic Arts continued to be used, though with little regard for their maintenance, and the Schools of Dramatic Arts, Music, and Ballet were allowed to fall into various states of abandonment and decay. The School of Ballet, nestled in a shady ravine, became completely engulfed in tropical jungle overgrowth. Ricardo Porro and later Vittorio Garatti were compelled to leave the country.&lt;ref name="wmf.org"/&gt;

==Rehabilitation of the National Art Schools==
In 1982, a group of young Cuban architects, all critical of the way architecture was taught and practiced in Cuba, began meeting informally. In 1988 they were given official status as a part of the [[Hermanos Saíz]], a young artists’ organization under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture.   The 1980s in Cuba were a period that produced art that was highly polemical, even protest oriented. The Ministry of Culture had a higher tolerance for discord than the Ministry of Construction, and it was for this reason that young architects sought to associate themselves there.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', p.147&lt;/ref&gt; High on their agenda was the restoration of the National Art Schools to Cuba's architectural heritage. This was not necessarily a safe position to take at this time, yet the Ministry of Culture allowed them a certain latitude within which to maneuver. By 1989 John Loomis, a North American architect and scholar, met Roberto Gottardi and the Havana Biennial of Art, and Gottardi conducted him on a tour of the schools. Moved by the compelling architecture and story, Loomis embarked on a decade-long project that produced the book ''Revolution of Forms, Cuba’s Forgotten Art Schools''.&lt;ref name="wmf.org"/&gt;

The 1990s were a decade of political, if not material, rehabilitation for the schools and their architects. In 1991, the Hermanos Saíz organized a provocative exhibit entitled ''Arquitectura Joven'' that was presented as part of the Fourth Havana Biennial. Prominent in the exhibition was a photomontage by Rosendo Mesias highly critical of the crumbling state of the schools. In 1995, the schools were nominated for national monument status but were rejected for not being old enough to meet criteria. Also in 1995, the U.S. photographer Hazel Hankin held an exhibit in Havana of photographs of the schools in their state of neglect. The exhibit provoked a strong response, and in 1996, upon the initiative of Cuban cultural officials, the New York architects Norma Barbacci and Ricardo Zurita prepared nomination papers on behalf of the schools for the [[World Monuments Fund]]. The schools were eventually added to the WMF watch list in 2000 and 2002. In 1997, the Cuban National Conservation Institute designated the National Art Schools as a “protected zone”.&lt;ref name="wmf.org"/&gt;

The three architects also underwent a process of political "rehabilitation".  Vittorio Garatti first returned to Cuba in June 1988 for a personal visit. Ricardo Porro returned for the first time in March 1996 for a series of public lectures, which were attended by standing-room-only audiences. Porro returned again in January 1997 to conduct a three-week design charrette with students, and give lectures.  Vittorio Garatti also returned later that same year in June and lectured at the Colegio de Arquitectos. Porro returned again in 1998 to lecture, and in that same year an issue of ''Arquitectura Cuba'' was dedicated to him and his work. The subsequent issue was dedicated to Roberto Gottardi and his work. Throughout the 1990s there was much debate about the schools and this debate moved to higher and higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, ''Revolution of Forms'', pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba's National Art Schools attain national monument status===
1999 proved to be a critical year for the schools. In March, the book ''Revolution of Forms, Cuba’s Forgotten Art Schools'' was launched at two high-profile events. In Los Angeles the launch took place at R. M. Schindler’s Kings Road House at the [[MAK Center]], with an exhibition of photos of the schools by Paolo Gasparini taken in 1965. The event reunited Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti, and Roberto Gottardi for an emotional first time since 1966, when they had last seen each other in Havana. The MAK Center event was repeated in New York at [[Columbia University]] and the [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]], generating copious press, including two articles in the ''New York Times''. The exhibit went on to tour across Europe and the United States; all of the events and press coverage were closely followed by government officials in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;''In Cuba, Seeds of a Design Renaissance'', NY Times, October 7, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''CURRENTS: LOS ANGELES -- REVOLUTIONS; Art Schools Of Cuba, Forgotten No More'', NY Times,  March 18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Revolution of Forms'' also became a major topic of discussion among architects in Havana. At one meeting prior to its publication a government official declared that Loomis, the author, was “an enemy of Cuba, being paid by the CIA, to write a book about the National Art Schools in order to make Cuba and the Revolution look bad”.&lt;ref name="wmf.org"/&gt; By October 1999, however, the debate had reached the national congress of the [[National Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba]] (UNEAC) with the Council of State where the discussion was about the cultural role of architecture in Cuba. When it came to the National Art Schools, several important figures declared that the schools were the greatest architectural achievements of the Cuban Revolution. The ensuing discussion acknowledged the influence of ''Revolution of Forms''—the international attention it had garnered and the many foreign travelers it had attracted to visit the National Art Schools.&lt;ref name="wmf.org"/&gt; Unfortunately, the schools were in a far-from-presentable state. Shortly thereafter, Castro declared that the schools would be recognized, restored, and preserved as national monuments. Porro and Garatti were summoned to a meeting in December 1999 with government officials to plan for the restoration. In November 2011, the National Art Schools were declared monuments by the National Council of Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutionofforms.com/architects.html|title=Revolution of Forms: Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools|work=revolutionofforms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Heritage status===
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on February 28, 2003 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref name="unescoworldheritagecentre"/&gt;

==Additional works inspired by the story of the schools==

[[Felipe Dulzaides]], a Cuban artist, had studied at the National Art Schools and had often marveled at the beauty of the architecture there—especially the magic realist aura evoked by the group of buildings. He had been unaware of their origins until he came upon a copy of ''Revolution of Forms'' in the United States. His artistic response to the story came later that year in the form of a video-documented performance-art piece called ''Next Time it Rains the Water Will Run'', in which he cleans out the watercourses of the abandoned School of Ballet.

The story of the National Art Schools continued to inspire Dulzaides resulting in a performance/installation in 2004 for the Proyecto Invitación in Havana, which was followed by a more extensive, and highly acclaimed, installation titled ''Utopía Posible'' at the Gwangju Biennial (South Korea) in 2008 and the Havana Biennial in 2009. This endeavor also evolved into a documentary video titled ''Utopía Posible''—a series of penetrating, and sometimes disquieting, interviews with Gottardi about his artistic quest for meaning during his years in revolutionary Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/art-design/80806/felipe-dulzaides-utopia-possible|title=Theater|work=Time Out Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Cubans have also been inspired by the universal nature of the story of the National Art Schools. Alysa Nahmias was so moved by the schools she saw during her study abroad experience in Cuba as an undergraduate at New York University that she began working on a documentary film about the schools in 2001. The film, ''[[Unfinished Spaces]]'', was co-directed by Ben Murray and scheduled to premiere in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajnafilm.com/unfinishedspaces/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[San Francisco]] area-based filmmaker [[Charles Koppelman]] was also inspired by the schools’ story and sought a medium that would embrace all of the arts: visual arts, music, dance, and theater. His vision was for an opera, ''Revolution of Forms'', named after the book from which he learned the schools’ story. Koppelman is producer as well as librettist along with author (and former NAS faculty member) [[Alma Guillermoprieto]]. [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] serves as director and designer, while [[Anthony Davis (composer)|Anthony Davis]], [[Gonzalo Rubalcaba]], and [[Dafnis Prieto]] contribute their contributions to the music. Koppelman saw that this particular journey—a universal human quest to create a better world—played itself out in a heroic and classic literary arc of passion, love, betrayal, despair, and ultimately hope. It is in production to become a multilingual opera in five acts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southfloridaclassicalreview.com/2009/03/composer-stokes-the-flames-of-revolution-with-castro-opera/|title=South Florida Classical Review|work=southfloridaclassicalreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watermillcenter.org/events/revolution|title=Revolution of Forms|work=watermillcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, music from the first two acts of ''Revolution of Forms'' was performed at the New York Opera’s VOX series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycopera.com/calendar/view.aspx?id=12664&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">'''Plastic arts''' are [[art form]]s which involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by [[Molding (process)|molding]] or modeling such as [[sculpture]] or [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. 

Less often, and less usefully, the term may be used broadly for all the [[visual arts]] (such as painting, sculpture, film and photography), as opposed to literature and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials for use in the plastic arts, in the narrower definition, include those that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, [[concrete]], glass, or [[metal]].

The term "[[plastic]]" has been used to mean certain synthetic organic resins ever since they were invented, but the term "plastic arts" long preceded them. 

The term should not be confused, either, with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s concept of "[[Neoplasticism]]".

In contrast to the limiting of 'plastic arts' to sculpture and architecture by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] in 1807,&lt;ref&gt;Russian Romantic Criticism: An Anthology, edited by Lauren Gray Leighton, Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987,  {{ISBN|0313255849}}, {{ISBN|978-0313255847}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German critic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767-1845) applied the concept not only to visual arts, but also poetry. 

Classical poetry lines he saw utilizing plastic isolation, and rhyme falling under the Romantic (domain). &lt;ref&gt;''The literary theories of August Wilhelm Schlegel'' by Ralph W. Ewton jnr, Published by Walter de Gruyter and Co (1972), {{ISBN|3110991632}}, {{ISBN|978-3110991635}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In Schlegel's Viennese lectures (1809-1811), published in 1827 as ''On the Theory and History of the Plastic Arts'', he contrasted the plasticism of Classical Art with picturesque Romanticism. He {{quotation|"operated with the antinomy of terms plastic/pictorial, mechanically/ organically, finite/ infinite, and closed/accomplished. Schlegel stated that the spirit of the entire antique culture and poetry was plastic and that the spirit of modern culture, however, was picturesque (pittoresk)".|&lt;ref&gt;''Civic Art Then and Now: The Culture of Good Place-making'' by Charles C. Bohl, in Sitte, Hegemann and the Metropolis: Modern Civic Art and International Exchanges, edited by Charles Bohl and Jean-François Lejeune, Published by Routledge, 2009, {{ISBN|0415424070}}, {{ISBN|978-0415424073}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  These distinctions were carried over into Russian Romanticism aesthetics, {{quotation|"[[Dmitry Venevitinov|Venevitinov]] objected to the indiscriminate use of the term 'pictures'. 

In his use of August Schlegel's term 'plastic' (''plastisch'', ''plastika'') he argues for a return to the simple, primitive, enclosed, defined, limited, finite, corporeal, and plastic world of the ancients. There seem to have been two interpretations of the plastic - picturesque contrast (antitheses) in Romantic Idealist philosophy.  As Venevitinov uses the contrast, and as August Schlegel intended it to be used when he defined it in Lecture I of ''Vorlesungen über dramatische Kunst und Literatur'', it denoted the difference between the corporeal mind of the man of antiquity and the 'picturesque' mind of modern man.  Ancient art appeals directly to the senses, modern art gives rise to mental pictures or images. The former is therefore real and corporeal, the latter ideal."|&lt;ref&gt;Russian Romantic Criticism: An Anthology, edited by Lauren Gray Leighton, Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987,  {{ISBN|0313255849}}, {{ISBN|978-0313255847}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Pál (Paul) Böhm''' (28 December 1839, [[Nagyvárad]] - 29 March 1905, [[Munich]]) was a Hungarian [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

==Life and work==
He first studied drawing with his father, who was a maintenance engineer at the bishop's manor. After finishing elementary school, he tried his hand at many crafts, including carpentry, [[coppersmith]]ing and toy making. In 1859, he joined a group of scenery painters and learned that craft from {{ill|Antal Haan|hu|Haan Antal}}.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC00523/02237.htm Böhm Pál] @ Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, he finally decided to become a painter, eventually travelling to Vienna, where he copied the works on display in the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere Palace]]. In 1865, he returned to his hometown and attempted to make a living by painting portraits and altarpieces. He also briefly operated a painting school that was attended by [[László Paál]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

Two years later, he was sufficiently established to earn a decent living and moved to Budapest, where he exhibited with the National Society of Hungarian Fine Arts. In 1871, he received a scholarship from [[Tivadar Pauler]], the Minister of Religion and Education. This enabled him to travel to Munich,&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; where he quickly became part of the city's artistic life and associated with a group of Hungarian painters led by [[Géza Mészöly (painter)|Géza Mészöly]]. On several occasions, he stayed in the [[Tisza]] region, where he painted and sketched, but settled in Munich permanently in 1875. After this point, his paintings lost some of their freshness and are generally considered by critics to be rather commercial.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

[[File:Revenge of the Goldfish.jpeg|thumb|300px|''Revenge of the Goldfish'', photograph of an installation by [[Sandy Skoglund]], 1981.]]
[[File:Revenge Of The Goldfish.jpg|thumb|200px|The photograph was used for the cover of the 1992 album ''[[Revenge of the Goldfish]]'' by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Inspiral Carpets]].]]
'''''Revenge of the Goldfish''''' is a photograph of an [[Installation art|installation]] completed in 1981 by contemporary artist [[Sandy Skoglund]]. The band [[Inspiral Carpets]] used the photograph for the cover of their 1992 album, also titled ''[[Revenge of the Goldfish]]''.

==Overview==
Like many of her other works, such as Radioactive Cats and Fox Games, the piece is a set composed of props and human models, which Skoglund poses and then photographs.&lt;ref name="Annenberg Learner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dreams and Visions: Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/242/index.html|website=Annenberg Learner|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, a child sits on the edge of a bed while an adult sleeps next to him. The set of the scene is a monochromatic blue, with contrasting bright orange [[goldfish]] floating through the room. The goldfish in the piece were sculpted by Skoglund out of [[terracotta]] and bring an element of fantasy to an otherwise normal scene.&lt;ref name="Annenberg Learner"/&gt; According to Skoglund, "If the fish are eliminated the image shows nothing unusual; just a room with two people in bed.”&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandy Skoglund in Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/demetrio.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The piece was first on display at the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://www.slam.org/emuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=Browse&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;quicksearch=Revenge%20of%20the%20Goldfish|publisher=[[Saint Louis Art Museum]]}} Accession Number: 1745:1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the piece has been in several collections at various museums, including [[Smith College Museum of Art]],&lt;ref name=smith1&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish (photograph)|url=http://museums.fivecolleges.edu/detail.php?museum=sc&amp;t=objects&amp;type=all&amp;f=&amp;s=Skoglund&amp;record=10|website=Collections Database|publisher=Five Colleges and Historic Deerfield Museum Consortium|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number: SC 1999:22-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dallas Museum of Art]],&lt;ref name=dma&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=https://www.dma.org/collection/artwork/sandy-skoglund/revenge-goldfish|publisher=[[Dallas Museum of Art]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number: 1981.32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akron Art Museum]],&lt;ref name=akron&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://akronartmuseum.org/collection/Obj1713?sid=308&amp;x=368122|publisher=[[Akron Art Museum]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number: 1982.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://www.cartermuseum.org/artworks/29268|publisher=[[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith College Museum of Art also owns the original installation.&lt;ref name=smith2&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish (installation)|url=http://museums.fivecolleges.edu/detail.php?museum=sc&amp;t=objects&amp;type=all&amp;f=&amp;s=Skoglund&amp;record=11|website=Collections Database|publisher=Five Colleges and Historic Deerfield Museum Consortium|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number:  	SC 1999:22-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Photography is as essential to Skoglund’s work as are the installations themselves because without photographs, the sets would eventually disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Sandy Skoglund|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/luca.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She visualizes the photograph after she has begun arranging the props so as not to “paralyze the process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dreishpoon|first1=Douglas|title=An Interview with Sandy Skoglund|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/dreishspoon.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skoglund believes that photography, combined with the installation, implies “...a realistic component and another, unreal one that, intruding on reality, interferes with it.”&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"/&gt;  In photographing ''Revenge of the Goldfish'', Skoglund chooses an angle that makes the models’ identities ambiguous to the viewer.&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"/&gt;  This ambiguity has elicited numerous arguments over the meaning of ''Revenge of the Goldfish''.&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"/&gt;  Some interpret the image as a sexual awakening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett|first1=Terry|title=Sandy Skoglund's 'Revenge of the Goldfish''-Reply|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teacherartexchange/archive/Feb96/0248.html|website=The Getty|accessdate=2014-10-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051139/http://www.getty.edu/education/teacherartexchange/archive/Feb96/0248.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while others see it as a message about homosexuality or child abuse.

==Inspiration==
Skoglund’s interest in filmmaking as an undergraduate, the death of her mother as a graduate student, and her move to [[New York City]] after graduate school, have all inspired her to create art in the way she does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Baron|first1=Judith|title=Essay by Judith Van Baron|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/scad.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Revenge of the Goldfish'', “[Skoglund] draws liberally from the conventions of [[science fiction]] and [[horror film]]s, and the display techniques of [[natural history]] museums and store windows.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heiferman|first1=Marvin|title=Serious Thoughts Are Popping UP|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/marvin2.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sesame Street Live''' is a [[Adapted live stage tours|live touring show]] based on the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and produced by [[Feld Entertainment]].

==History==
[[VStar Entertainment Group|Vee Corporation]] was started in March 1980&lt;ref name=vt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nakashima|first1=Rebecca|title=VStar Finds New CEO|url=http://www.venuestoday.com/news/detail/vstar-finds-new-ceo-4616|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Venues Today|date=April 6, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an idea by founder [[Vincent Egan]] to produce a live character show just for Sesame Street.&lt;ref name="sp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopps|first1=Megan|title=Dayton resident, creator of Sesame Street Live, dies at 74|url=http://pressnews.com/2016/12/06/dayton-resident-creator-of-sesame-street-live-dies-at-74/|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Sun Press|publisher=ECM Publishers, Inc.|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based it off his time working for the Ice Follies which had a segment with those Muppets. Egan approached Jim Henson's company and [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], who were interested.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news|last1=St. Anthony|first1=Neal|title=Bringing Muppets to 'Live'|url=http://www.startribune.com/bringing-muppets-to-live/80240617/|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Star Tribune|date=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With outside funding, Vee was able to sign a licensing agreement with the Children's Television Workshop for the characters.&lt;ref name="sp"/&gt;

The first Sesame Street Live show opened in September 1980 at the [[Metropolitan Sports Center]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] for a five-day run. That show was successful. The following shows in five locations had lackluster attendance costing VEE the profits made in Bloomington. Egan figured that the marketing material was confusing people in those markets as what type of show was not specified. He overhauled the script and marketing while getting his creditors to wait for payments. That Christmas, the show went on to play for four weeks at [[Madison Square Garden]]'s 4,000-seat Felt Forum in New York City before an audience of 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;

VEE quickly ramp up to two different shows for the 1981 to 1982 season then added a third Australia show in 1982 to 1983. From the 1983-1984 season until the 1988-1989 season there were only two Sesame Street Live shows on tour.&lt;ref name="bcam"/&gt;

On April 1, 2015, Blue Star Media, LLC purchased VEE Corporation with Egan continuing on as a consultant&lt;ref name="vt1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deckard|first1=Linda|title=Hello Sanjay, New Owner of VEE|url=http://www.venuestoday.com/news/detail/hello-sanjay-new-owner-of-vee-4715|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Venues Today|date=April 7, 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year was renamed VStar Entertainment Group.&lt;ref name=vt/&gt; In November 2016, Sesame Workshop announced an agreement with [[Feld Entertainment]] for a new Sesame Street Live show thus ending Vstar's arena version in July 2017.&lt;ref name=licmag&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Sesame Street’ to Take the Stage|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/sesame-street-take-stage|accessdate=January 17, 2017|work=License! Global|publisher=UBM|date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the company would continued other Sesame Street shows at various locations plus the [[United Service Organizations]] tour while still providing costumes.&lt;ref name="vt0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weissberg|first1=Brad|title=VStar Buys Cirque Productions|url=http://www.venuestoday.com/news/detail/vstar-buys-cirque-productions|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Venues Today|date=January 9, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==

In order to keep the show running annually in the same cities, new plot lines are created and rotated through the tour.  Because the target audience changes as children grow up, shows are often removed from the rotation for a few years, then return with some modifications.

The '''Singapore Sports Hub''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 新加坡体育城; [[Malay language|Malay]]: Hab Sukan Singapura; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: சிங்கப்பூர் விளையாட்டு மையம்) is a fully integrated sports, entertainment and lifestyle hub in [[Kallang]], [[Singapore]]. Built in 2014 to host sporting and entertainment events, it replaced the [[Former National Stadium, Singapore|former National Stadium]] on the recommendation of then Community Development and Sports Minister [[Abdullah Tarmugi]] in Parliament in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/today20010315-2.2.33.4.aspx?q=%2522Sports+Hub%2522+%2522Singapore%2522&amp;mode=advanced&amp;df=19960101&amp;dt=20031231&amp;ct=article&amp;t=newpaper%252ctoday&amp;page=1&amp;sort=relevance&amp;token=singapore%252chub%252csports&amp;sessionid=a173d6bbf4e44bfb946151373334838f|title=Newspaper Article - State-of-the-art sports hub in the offing, says Mr Abdullah|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal was based on a Committee on Sporting Singapore report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mccy.gov.sg/en/Topics/Sports/Articles/~/media/1E003B9BD39341B2B658916962DD7F4F.ashx|title=Report of the Committee of Sporting Singapore|last=|first=|date=July 2001|website=|publisher=Ministry of Community Development and Sports, Singapore|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote a culture of sports in the city-state.

It is the first and largest sports facilities infrastructure [[Public-private-partnership|Public-Private-Partnership (PPP)]] project in the world and Singapore's flagship PPP project of this nature. Following an Invitation to Tender by the then [[Sport Singapore|Singapore Sports Council]] in 2006, the consortium SportsHub Pte Ltd comprising four equity partners, InfraRed Capital Partners, Dragages Singapore, Cushman &amp; Wakefield Facilities &amp; Engineering, and Global Spectrum Asia, won the bid for the project on January 19, 2008. It was officially appointed on August 25, 2010 to design, build, finance and operate the Singapore Sports Hub for a period of 25 years.

Construction of the Singapore Sports Hub began with a ground-breaking ceremony on 29 September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/newsroom/media-releases/2010/9/singapore-sports-hub--marking-a-new-chapter-of-a-sporting-singapore|title=Singapore Sports Hub - Marking A New Chapter Of A Sporting Singapore|website=Sport Singapore|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the former arena there was demolished. Served primarily by the [[Stadium MRT station]], it was completed in June 2014 and, among others, rolled out a new 55,000-seat [[National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]] with the largest free-spanning retractable dome roof in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/under-one-roof-take-a-sneak-peek-at-the-singapore-sports-hub|title=Under one roof: Take a sneak peek at the Singapore Sports Hub|last=migration|date=2014-02-27|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arup.com/news/2012_10_october/04_oct_worlds_largest_dome_roof_on_sports_hub_underway|title=Worlds largest dome roof under construction - Arup|website=www.arup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; an aquatic centre, a multi-sport indoor arena, and a water sports facility. The Singapore Sports Hub, which incorporated an existing 12,000-seat [[Singapore Indoor Stadium]], began operations on June 30, 2014 for the general public to start using its facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/sports/free-access-month|title=Free access for a month|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially opened it 13 months later on July 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/pm-marks-youth-day-opens-sports-hub-in-front-of-50000-crowd|title=PM marks Youth Day, opens Sports Hub in front of 50,000 crowd|last=hermesauto|date=2015-07-26|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rugby World Club 10s on 21–22 June 2014 was the first sporting event at the new national stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/new-national-stadium-opens-its-doors-it-hosts-rugby-world-club-10s|title=New National Stadium opens its doors as it hosts the Rugby World Club 10s|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622034538/http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/new-national-stadium-opens-its-doors-it-hosts-rugby-world-club-10s|archive-date=2014-06-22|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clash between Singapore and Juventus on 16 August 2014 was the first football game there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/sports/football-juventus-beat-spore-selection-5-0-friendly-new-national-stadium|title=Football: Juventus beat S'pore Selection 5-0 in friendly at new National Stadium|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since opening its doors, the Sports Hub has been a venue for major international, regional and local events. It has played host to the [[2015 SEA Games]], 2016 [[Singapore National Day Parade]], [[BNP Paribas]] [http://www.wtafinals.com/ WTA Finals], HSBC Singapore Rugby Sevens, [[International Champions Cup]] and superstars [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Jay Chou]].

==Construction timeline==
The demolition of the former National Stadium was slated to begin in 2008 while the construction of the new Sports Hub was originally planned for completion in 2011. Due to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and high construction costs, the project was inevitably delayed. In 2008, barring any major problems, the hub should be ready by 2013 when Singapore would play host to the [[2013 Southeast Asian Games|27th Southeast Asian Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Sports Hub may now be ready only by 2012 |url = http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_248603.html |work = [[The Straits Times]] |date = 17 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, expected delays were announced in 2009 and Singapore had to withdrew its hosting rights for the 2013 Southeast Asian Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = S'pore may not host 2013 SEA Games due to Sports Hub delay  |url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1008335/1/.html |publisher = [[Channel NewsAsia]] |date = 30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singaporeathletics.com/singapore-videos/sea-games-2013 |title=We're not hosting SEA Games 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213159/http://www.singaporeathletics.com/singapore-videos/sea-games-2013 |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, it was reported that the contract to begin construction had been signed with plans for the demolition works of the former National Stadium to start in October 2010 and for the completion of the new Sports Hub in April 2014. The demolition of the National Stadium started with a groundbreaking ceremony on 29 September 2010, marking the official end of the Grand Old Dame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Finally, groundbreaking ceremony for Sports Hub  |url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1084083/1/.html |publisher = [[Channel NewsAsia]] |date = 29 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bid process==
Three finalist [[consortium|consortia]] (Singapore Gold Consortium, Alpine Mayreder, Singapore Sports Hub Consortium) submitted their plans in Feb 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Satish |last = Cheney |title = All 3 proposals for the new Sports Hub are 'truly spectacular': Vivian Balakrishnan |url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/267019/1/.html |publisher = [[Channel NewsAsia]] |date = 28 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Patwant  |last = Singh |title = Final race begins on proposals for Singapore Sports Hub |url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/309724/1/.html |publisher = [[Channel NewsAsia]] |date = 5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2008, the [[Singapore government]] awarded the development of the Sports Hub project to Singapore Sports Hub Consortium (SSHC), led by Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = 'Cool Dome' design wins Singapore Sports Hub project |url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/323568/1/.html |publisher = [[Channel NewsAsia]] |date = 19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the announcement of the successful bidder at a press conference, the minister of [[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (Singapore)|Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports]], Dr [[Vivian Balakrishnan]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Consortium displayed significant strengths in programming, team culture and partnership, functionality and layout. It also offered the best value for money solution for Singapore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Singapore Sports Hub Consortium, Led By Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd, Selected as Preferred Bidder For Sports Hub Project |url = http://www.ssc.gov.sg/publish/Corporate/en/news/media_releases/2008/singapore_sports_hub.html |publisher = [[Singapore Sports Council]] |date = 19 January 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123133127/http://www.ssc.gov.sg/publish/Corporate/en/news/media_releases/2008/singapore_sports_hub.html |archivedate = 23 January 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surveillance Art''' is the use of technology intended to record human behavior in a way that offers commentary on the process of [[surveillance]] or the technology used to surveil.  Surveillance Art manifests itself in many different forms, from short films to architecture, but all have been shown to provide some type of critical response to the rise of surveillance by various authorities and the technology used to achieve it, especially when dealing with issues of security and enforcing laws.

==History==
With new technology, came new surveillance and new ways of responding to it through artistic media. With the advent of video-recording devices, closed circuit television, and digital cameras, remote surveillance of subjects became possible. One of the most popular figures to adapt these new methods of surveillance to art was [[Andy Warhol]].

Warhol’s movie, ''Outer and Inner Space'', introduced the performance-art possibilities of high-tech surveillance to the modern world. At the same time, it provided the observed subject with the image or knowledge of being observed, in this case the actress [[Edie Sedgwick]]. "On the left, Sedgwick's video image, in full profile, gazes off to the right, looking up as if she were talking to someone standing above her. On the right, the 'real' (or 'live') Edie sits in three-quarter profile facing left, addressing someone sitting off-screen to the left of Warhol's movie camera -- an arrangement which at times creates the illusion that we are watching Sedgwick in conversation with her own image."&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Callie. "Andy Warhol. Outer and Inner Space.." CNTRL[SPACE]. hosting.zkm.de/ctrlspace/e/texts/56 (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late twentieth century, the AIDS epidemic, cancer rates, and other health concerns created a new form of surveillance. Suddenly, the condition of the human body and potential for contagion became an addition to existing systems of observation.

"The ‘my body, my business’ ideal in the clinical setting dovetailed with broader societal concerns about snoops, spies, and surveillance, setting the stage for a fundamental recasting of the politics of surveillance in the last decades of the twentieth century. The encounter over HIV represented the high water mark of patient participation in the politics of surveillance. "&lt;ref&gt;"H-Net Announcement." Humanities and Social Sciences Net Online. www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=150810  (accessed April 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Modern===

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 sparked a new wave of American surveillance of the citizen body. This was primarily a form of electronic information gathering—monitoring of phones and email, Internet use, tracking and tracing of cell phones and GPS units. In certain instances, the detaining and/or monitoring of U.S. citizens of various ethnicities compounded the already growing debate on the violation of civil liberties. In July 2006, Ms. [[Mary DeRosa]], a Senior Fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, testified at a congressional hearing on the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]. At this point, different organizations within the United States government had been applying separate acts to monitor perceived threats of foreign agents, sometimes at cross-purposes and with varying degrees of rights violation.

DeRosa stated: "The national security agencies and their employees are charged with protecting the United States from harm. When faced with a decision about whether to take a step that invades liberties they will not always be able to judge whether it is the only way or the best way to address a problem -- or whether it is simply the easiest way."&lt;ref&gt;"Statement of Mary B. DeRosa on FISA for the 21st Century." FAS Intelligence Resource Program. www.fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/072606derosa.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As homeland security issues forced questions of the infringement of civil liberties, the response of various practitioners of surveillance art questioned the notion of privacy. In one of the most notorious cases, the price of innocence and freedom seems to be the willing sacrifice of one’s personal privacy.

The case of [[Hasan Elahi]] has also addressed new technologies in surveillance: tracking and tracing of cell phones, the capabilities of [[GPS]] technology, and worldwide Internet access by both the observer and the observed. The relationship between the watcher and the body watched becomes an impetus to the artwork itself.

Elahi has stated of his art: "Both quantitative and qualitative information is incorporated into my work, and the entire process results in translations and mistranslations between the physical and the virtual, between the body politic and the singular citizen. The mutual misunderstandings that inevitably occur provide the inertial energy for the continuing activity and effectiveness of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Elahi, Hasan. "Hasan Elahi." Hasan Elahi. http://elahi.sjsu.edu/ (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Futurist===

The latest evolution of response to surveillance systems is to become the system. New forms of [[biometric]] surveillance—such as heart rate monitors, and facial recognition software—are being utilized for personalized experiences and amusement park rides.&lt;ref&gt;Pohflep, Sascha. "Biometric." We Make Money not Art.  http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/biometric/ (accessed April 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond biometrics is the integration of cybernetic technology into Surveillance Art. The Canadian filmmaker, Robert Spence, has adapted a miniature camera into his prosthetic eye. In an odd reversal, Spence has finally come full circle with the concept of Surveillance Art: ‘"Originally the whole idea was to do a documentary about surveillance. I thought I would become a sort of super hero … fighting for justice against surveillance," Spence said. "In Toronto there are 12,000 cameras. But the strange thing I discovered was that people don’t care about the surveillance cameras, they were more concerned about me and my secret camera eye because they feel that is a worse invasion of their privacy."&lt;ref&gt;Klint, Finley.

==Popularized Areas==

===Performance===

On May 3, 2008, artists Robin Hewlett and Ben Kinsley staged a simulated street scene in a Pittsburgh neighborhood when the [[Google Street View]] team came through. They named the project "Street with a View" which they describe as introducing "fiction, both subtle and spectacular, into the doppelganger world of Google Street View." Using an array of local residents and actors, scenes included a marathon, a parade, a garage band practice, firemen rescuing a cat, and a sword fight. This was the first time that Google Street View had been used as a means of art, specifically, as surveillance art.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, Robin, and Ben Kinsley. "STREET WITH A VIEW: a project by Robin Hewlett &amp; Ben Kinsley." STREET WITH A VIEW: a project by Robin Hewlett &amp; Ben Kinsley. http://www.streetwithaview.com/index.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance Camera Players (SCP), based in New York City and founded by Bill Brown, are one of the main innovators of this art form. This group of actors stages various plays in public spaces, their first one being [[Alfred Jarry]]’s "[[Ubu Roi]]" on December 10, 1996 at the 14th Street-Union Square Subway station. They have performed other famous works such as [[Samuel Beckett]]’s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s ''[[The Raven]]'', [[George Orwell]]’s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|"1984"]] and ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Their plays are staged in very public places such as subway stations, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Washington Square Park, Union Square, and various other landmarks throughout the city. Their primary purpose is to create a public spectacle in order to get people to question the role surveillance plays in their lives. These performances may be witnessed by the public, yet the actual recordings of these performances remain inaccessible. The SCP is said to have been inspired by the anti-surveillance manifesto, "Guerilla Programming of Surveillance Equipment," but state that they were not the first to stage surveillance camera theater.&lt;ref&gt;"Setting the Stage for the Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/gpvse.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; They state that it was the invention of comedy writers:

Properly speaking, surveillance camera theater was invented by a comedy writer, not a privacy advocate or a performance artist: i.e., the person(s) who in 1981 wrote the "On the Job" episode of the American TV sit-com ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', in which Alex Reiger (played by [[Judd Hirsch]]) temporarily gets a job as a camera-watching security guard. Bored by the isolation and silence, Alex eventually learns to pass the time by improvising skits in front of the surveillance camera and watching himself on the monitor at the same time. When Alex's shift is over, he is replaced by a veteran of the place (played by "Grampa" [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]), who pulls out a ventriloquist's dummy and starts performing in front of the surveillance camera as soon as his shift begins! The implication was that every security guard—when no one (else) was looking—was passing the time in this way. On October 12, 1992, [[Saturday Night Live]] included a skit that imagined that during the night, when everyone else had gone home, the people who worked at Rockefeller Center would amuse themselves and each other by putting on little skits in front of the building's surveillance cameras. As in Taxi, none of these skits had any political content and none of them concerned privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Before the Formation of the Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/scp-antecedents.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCP has a wide following around the world and has even spawned sister groups in Arizona, California, Italy, Lithuania, Sweden, and Turkey suggesting how the issue of surveillance is one which transcends nationalities and cultures, bringing people together to make one synonymous public statement.&lt;ref&gt;"Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/the-scp.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural===

Some surveillance artists choose to use architecture as canvases. The buildings and structures they use are in highly visible areas with lots of pedestrians. The artists install a surveillance system that tracks human movement through and/or around the structure. The system is connected to a viewing format, such as a large screen or light installation, which are triggered by human movement. As one artist describes it, "All the visual elements in the projection result from people’s movements through the space."&lt;ref&gt;Abundance. "Camille Utterback." Camille Utterback :: interactive video art.http://www.CamilleUtterback.com/abundance.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance art elicits interaction from viewers while making them more aware of the pervasiveness of surveillance.

Some architectural surveillance art pieces involve large screen installations or projections on highly visible buildings in populated areas. Artist [[Christian Moeller]]’s 2006 project, "Nosy," includes a street-level camera which records the active surrounding environment, including pedestrians, cars, and a nearby train in Osaki City, Japan. The real-time video is "displayed in bitmap graphics [and projected] onto three towers covered with white LEDs behind frosted glass panels."&lt;ref&gt;"A TIME AND PLACE - Christian Moeller." A TIME AND PLACE - Christian Moeller. http://www.christian-moeller.com/display.php?project_id=59&amp;play=true (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Nosy.jpeg|Christian Moeller's Mojo utilizes a street-level camera to record the active surrounding environment in Osaki City, Japan. --&gt;

Artist [[Camille Utterback]] created a similar installation in 2007, called "Abundance," using the domed city hall of San Jose, California, as her interactive canvas. The installation includes a large surveillance camera focused on pedestrians and an abstract art animation, projected onto the city hall building. Pedestrians’ location and movement within the field of the camera are translated into abstract shapes that appear in the projection. As the pedestrian moves, the corresponding shape moves within the animation and interacts with other shapes in the projection. Utterback’s website states, "Movements and paths through the plaza become part of a collective visual record, and transform the building into a playful and dynamic canvas."&lt;ref&gt;Abundance. "Camille Utterback." Camille Utterback :: interactive video art. http://www.CamilleUtterback.com/abundance.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Abundance.jpg|Camille Utterback's Abundance uses San Jose's city hall as an interactive canvas. --&gt;

The Los Angeles-based artist team, Electroland, has been dedicated to working on interactive art projects.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Connection." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/connection (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their projects are architectural surveillance art through the use of light installations or electronic displays. One of their architectural installations, "Enteractive," uses both the inside and outside of a building in Los Angeles. This project, finished in 2006, involves tracking indoor participants’ movements and locations over a large floor light grid. Outside, their real-time locations and movement patterns are broadcast to anyone within view of the colored light grid installed onto the face of the building.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Connection." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/connection (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Enteractive.png |The outside of Electroland's Enteractive at 11th and Flower. --&gt;

Another of Electroland’s projects was incorporated into the Pedestrian Bridge of the Indianapolis Airport in 2008. The project, named "Connection," is made up of light "dots" that cover the length of the bridge, which light up in different colors as people pass through. The colored dots follow people’s movements and often interact with participants, "exhibit[ing] a range of intelligent and playful behaviors, accompanied by sounds."&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - EnterActive." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/enteractive (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Electroland has similar projects, including Target Breezeway, Lumen, and Drive By.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Lumen." Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/lumen (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Target Breezeway." Electroland -Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley. http://electroland.net/projects/targetbreezeway (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley ."

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Connection Bridge.png|Electroland's Connection on the Indianapolis Airport's Pedestrian Bridge. The lights change colors as pedestrians pass through the bridge. --&gt;

The French art team, Hehe, also works with architectural surveillance art but they prefer to take a "green" approach. Like Electroland, they have also done light installations, like their 2007 project in Luxembourg, "Grandes Lignes." This project includes light installations along a pedestrian footbridge that only light up where a pedestrian is located. Hehe describes the selective lighting as "the personal light sphere, which surrounds the traveler as they move from one end to the other." Hehe explains the intent behind the project: "The responsiveness of the system functions ecologically and economically – saving energy – and also metaphorically: Your shadow – of light – walks with you and follows you."&lt;ref&gt;"Grandes Lignes." HeHe. http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/grandeslignes/index.html(accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hehe has also started a set of projects under the title, "Pollstream," all of which are environmentally-focused. Of these, Nuage Vert, or "green cloud" in English, is architectural surveillance art. The 2008 project uses a thermo-sensitive camera and a laser with a green, cloud-shaped beam. Installed on a nearby building, the beam is projected onto the stream of pollution from a power plant in Helsinki, as a constant reminder to residents of their energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuage Vert." HeHe. http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/texte/nv/index.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Hehe’s focus in this project moves from direct surveillance of people to the surveillance of their factories and plants. Here, humans are being indirectly watched through what they produce, like air pollution. This is potentially the beginning of a move into air surveillance art.

===Inverse Surveillance/Sousveillance===

Inverse surveillance, or "[[sousveillance]]", makes use of surveillance technology such as cameras from the perspective of the participant, allowing the object of surveillance essentially to become the subject.  The term sousveillance was coined by [[Steve Mann]], a noted media artist.

Typical instances of sousveillance as art involve voluntarily recording and broadcasting one’s own activities (via webcam, for example).  The expressed purpose for this, in some cases, is to take away the value of the knowledge of the artist’s whereabouts and current activity. [[Hasan Elahi]], an interdisciplinary media artist who was falsely suspected of terrorism and detained by government authorities, has said that the goal of broadcasting his daily life is to devalue information about him since "Intelligence agencies, regardless of who they are, all operate in a market where their commodity is information, and the reason their information has value is because no one else has access to it."&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Elahi, Interview with Stephen Colbert.  http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/167606/may-07-2008/hasan-elahi (accessed 23 Apr. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by increasing access to the information, he is taking away the surveilling authority’s monopoly on it.

==Critical Responses==

The Surveillance Studies Network is an organization that focuses on surveillance and its various effects on society, and their online journal, ''Surveillance and Society'', publishes academic articles that present different aspects of surveillance.  In 2005, ''Surveillance and Society''’s second issue of the year featured two articles that included surveillance as an art form.

''The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment'' by Anders Albrechtslund and Lynsey Dubbeld takes an in depth look at surveillance and the roles it plays in art and popular culture.  Although Albrechtslund and Dubbeld focus on the entertainment factor of Surveillance Art, they also acknowledge its serious explorations and implications.  While Surveillance Art is entertainment, the artists "tend to focus on controversial aspects of surveillance practices or revealing the operation of surveillance technologies."  To illustrate this point, Albrechtslund and Dubbeld specifically referenced installation artist [[David Rokeby]].  "For instance, like several of Rokeby’s other works, ‘Sorting Daemon’ was concerned with revealing the powers of vision and surveillance, and bringing to the fore the discriminatory, judgmental classifications that computers are increasingly producing as they take over human tasks of observation and monitoring."&lt;ref&gt;Albrechtslund, Anders, and Lynsey Dubbeld. "The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/entertainment.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is observed that although surveillance has been prominent in art and other forms of entertainment, it hasn’t been studied in depth by Surveillance Studies scholars.  Albrechtslund and Dubbeld see a need for further exploration of this area of surveillance.  Surveillance as a form of entertainment isn’t paid as much attention as it deserves because it truly is a diverse field that is continuously developing.  "The entertaining side of surveillance is a phenomenon worth studying in itself, and we expect that this type of study will contribute to an understanding of the multi-faceted nature of surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Albrechtslund, Anders, and Lynsey Dubbeld. "The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/entertainment.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In article, "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces," Robert W. Sweeny, an art educator at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, questioned surveillance technologies and the role that visual arts plays with those technologies.  He then raised the question of how one would handle acknowledging surveillance technologies in the classroom.  He is a firm believer that "Those involved with the visual arts might learn much from studies regarding current surveillance technologies, going beyond the boundaries of traditional research methodologies, informing practices that interrogate the dynamics of power and vision in art educational settings."&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny, Robert W. "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/parasights.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching at The Pennsylvania State University, Sweeny used one project in particular to encourage his students to reveal "the power of the gaze" by exploring how surveillance brings about other ways of "seeing:"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These students chose the museum as a space that is based in looking and the ‘male gaze’, influenced by our readings of the course text, ''Ways of Seeing'' (Berger, 1972). Doubling the gaze of the surveillance camera through hand held video, then recording the individual recording the camera, they created a layered experience that lead to confusion. Through a tight editing process, they constantly reminded the viewer of the position of the camera operator (and the apparent laxness of the security guard) through the rapidly shifting camera shots. The images begin to break up as filmed image was filmed, layered with music that approached noise, only to return to a calm denouement, backing out of the doors that introduced the walking protagonist into a panoptic hall of mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny, Robert W. "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/parasights.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this project, the students not only created Surveillance Art, but by becoming the watchers, or what Sweeny would call the parasite, they were able to see beyond the environment that the museum created with its own surveillance cameras.

In his essays, interactive artist David Rokeby writes about the control and subjectivity that is created by artists who use technologies such as cameras:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The expressive power of the interface, in conjunction with the increasing 'apparent' transparency of interface technologies raises complicated ethical issues regarding subjectivity and control.  Interactive artists are in a position to take the lead in generating a discussion of these concerns, but, on the other hand, are also in danger of becoming apologists for industrial, corporate, and institutional uses of these technologies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rokeby has also written an essay for students who wish to create interactive art and he goes on to explain his perspective on the pieces he creates.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeby, David. "Transforming Mirrors: Subjectivity and Control in Interactive Media." David Rokeby - Media Installation Artist. http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/mirrors.html. (accessed February 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance Camera Players have been the inspiration for others who have gone on to create artistic project that involve some form of surveillance, however, they say that although they are flattered that they inspire others, they’re rarely impressed by the work that is created.  Their complaint is that in the videos that are created, the artists usually end up promoting "several of the primary ideological supports for generalized surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Surveillance Camera Players. "Biting the Hands that Applaud Us." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/the-scp.html. (accessed April 1, 2009)..&lt;/ref&gt; These works of art fail to connect their audiences to the everyday people who are being watched.

==Legalities==

Legally, police officials consider Surveillance Art as an extraordinary method of keeping people safe. According to police officials in State College, Pennsylvania, surveillance is divided into three major concepts "national, mechanical, and perceived; all of which have transformed from legally used terms into art."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Surveillance is government-based surveillance that aids police officers as well as the community. As far as aiding the community with national surveillance, "all police vehicles are equipped with a hidden GPS locater that has the ability to transmit the position of a police vehicle anywhere in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the community, National Surveillance means that a police official’s vehicle is heavily monitored at all times, causing him to be reprimanded if not at the location reported. From a governmental perspective, National Surveillance is essential for aiding police officials in investigations or simply identifying criminals. The [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS) allows police officials to "fingerprint and receive information on anyone who has ever been fingerprinted in only fifteen to twenty minutes."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation. "Integrated Automated Fingerprint System." 13 March 2008. &lt;http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/iafis.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  With the information gathered from an interview with a State College, Pennsylvania police officer, it is clear that National Surveillance has generated a type of "system balance" (between the government and the community) whose purpose with advancements in surveillance technology is to portray "truth."

Mechanical surveillance, although sharing similarities with National Surveillance, plays a somewhat different role in surveillance as an art form.  During the interview with the State College police officer, it was noted that "the camera in a police vehicle begins recording as soon as its emergency lights are switched on whether the vehicle is stopped or in motion."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mechanical surveillance plays a huge role in police investigation along with helping create surveillance art. With Internet sites like YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, people have the ability to create and share any type of video feed that interests them. As an example, the anonymous State College police officer referred to the riots at Penn State University after Penn State beat Ohio State University during the 2008-2009-football season. Several videos were posted on YouTube depicting celebratory acts that quickly transitioned into destructive malicious behavior. First, State College Police referred to these posted videos as police evidence in which they were able to apprehend and fine individuals involved in the riots. On the other hand, however, there are several videos of the riots in which inspirational music was added to portray "Penn State Pride" rather than committing an illegal act. Adding music to these types of videos transforms mechanical surveillance into Surveillance Art by creating an emotional attachment for the individuals who can relate to what the video visually portrays.

Perceived surveillance is a concept of Surveillance Art that is purely territorial and usually created by individuals involved with that particular community. Using State College, Pennsylvania as an example, an anonymous police officer stated that he believes Surveillance Art "creates a presence in the community that lowers the likelihood of crime, portraying a sense of ownership." With the advancement of technology in today’s society, it has become apparent that it is relatively easier for individuals to create "Perceived Surveillance Art." The interesting aspect of Perceived Surveillance Art is the fact that it can be anything. Examples of Perceived Surveillance Art can range from a mural on the side of a building to a simple statue of the baby Jesus in the front yard of an individual's home.

"With these created websites, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, it has become relatively easy for individuals to post and spread Surveillance Art throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. Pennsylvania State University. 19 February 2009. &lt;http://www.police.psu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, there are highly controversial videos (Rodney King beating and the shooting death of Oscar Grant by police officers) placed on these sites that have been edited to portray a specific individuals perception of that specific event or a different perspective on how that event should possibly be taken. When asking the State College police officer about how these sites affect police investigations, he stated that they "have no bearing on anything having to do with police work."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the new interpretations presented by the videos on these sites are welcomed by some police officers that like the idea and believe in Surveillance Art.

While discussing surveillance as an art form with a New York City bus driver, it was found to be "impossible for an individual to travel more than three blocks anywhere in New York without being on camera."&lt;ref&gt;Bus Driver Interview. Brooklyn, New York. 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When considering the three forms of surveillance (national, mechanical, and perceived) as art forms, it is clear that our society has evolved into a technically dependent era in which even the most reliable footage (unedited surveillance footage) can become art by simply transforming or even editing raw footage (adding music, or text) creating new material, resulting in Surveillance Art. Although the amount of surveillance in State College, Pennsylvania may not be as high as the amount of surveillance in New York City, it is interesting and notable that surveillance as an art form exists everywhere.

==Notable Examples==

These examples are representative of Surveillance Art's methods and effects. Although they use different technologies and tactics, they are united by an interest in the increasing prevalence of surveillance in modern society, and its effects on citizens and communities.

The '''Talbot''' was a  type of white [[hunting dog]]. It is now [[Extinction|extinct]] and has been credited with being an ancestor of the modern [[beagle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/the-beagle.html |title=The Beagle |publisher=Buzzle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bloodhound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/60.htm#VI |title=Mac Barwick's History: Chapter VI |publisher=Bloodhounds.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''talbot'' is used in [[heraldry]] to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog.

== History ==
[[Image:Cartercrest.jpg|thumb|[[Carter-Campbell of Possil|Carter of Castle Martin]] Crest: a talbot standing above a crown]]
The breed has been said to have originated in Normandy, perhaps to have been the white [[Bloodhound#History|St. Hubert Hound]], and to have been brought to England by [[William the Conqueror]], but this is not supported by evidence. There are no known references to the talbot as a breed of hound in Medieval French, and none have been found in English before the mid-16th century.

In Medieval times, "Talbot" was a common name for an individual hound, so used before 1400 in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]'' (l 3383), and used as an example of a hound name in a 16th-century book of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/turbervilesbook00turbgoog |title=Turberville, George (1575) '&amp;#39;The Noble Art of Venerie or Huntyng'&amp;#39; |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century it clearly existed as a breed or type. Large, heavy, slow hounds were 'talbot-like', whatever their colour, though the 'milk white' was 'the true talbot'.&lt;ref name=Markham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Markham |first1=Gervaise |title=Country Contentments or the Husbandman's Recreations |year=1605}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Somervile]] in his poem "The Chase",&lt;ref name=Chase&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerville|first1=William |title=The Chase Book 1 Ll282-335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2wgAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1735}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1735, describes the former use of "[[limier|lime-hounds]]" (leashe hounds) on the Scottish Borders to catch thieves, obviously referring to the bloodhound and the [[sleuth hound]], but adding that the (white) talbot was the "prime" example of this type of hound.

The origin of both the name and the animal is uncertain. In a quotation from about 1449, the king referred to [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]] as "Talbott, oure good dogge", perhaps as a play on his name, or in allusion to the family badge.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; In an MS in the British Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourPopupMax.asp?TourID=136 |title=The British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Talbot is shown presenting a Book of Romances to [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret]], with a white dog standing behind him, which serves, symbolically, to identify him. It is obviously a small hound, and it seems unlikely that it could have been used in this way if "Talbot" had been associated in the mind of the people of the time with a large animal.

[[File:Talbot Hounds Fountain in Trevelyan Square, Leeds (4134319142).jpg|thumb|left|Talbot Hounds Fountain in Trevelyan Square, [[Leeds]]]]

The talbot and the greyhound were, apparently, the only [[Hound (heraldry)|hounds]] used in [[English heraldry]], and it could be that the talbot originated as an emblematic or heraldic hound.&lt;ref&gt;Lampson S. M. "The Mystery of the Talbot Hound" in ''Country Life'' 1965&lt;/ref&gt; References to this heraldic talbot seem to be earlier than any references to a real dog.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The talbot figures in many [[Coats of Arms]], for instance in later ones of the earls of Shrewsbury, in which two talbots appear as [[supporter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hereditarytitles.com/Page24.html |title=Earl of Shrewsbury |publisher=Hereditarytitles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125225710/http://www.hereditarytitles.com/Page24.html |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/shrewsbury.htm]

It is quite a plausible idea that from these beginnings the name "talbot" was extended to any large heavy white scent hound, and from there helped to establish a breed or type. It was certainly similar to the bloodhound (and "white" is given as one of the colours of the bloodhound around the 16th and 17th centuries)&lt;ref&gt;Topsell, Edward  (1607), ''The History of Four Footed Beasts''&lt;/ref&gt; as regards size, and use as a leash-hound.&lt;ref name=Markham /&gt;

As earliest references to this dog are much later than those to bloodhounds it cannot convincingly be regarded as an ancestor of the bloodhound.

[[Image:BackTalbotInnSign.jpg|thumb|Unusual black Talbot on an Inn sign at Iwerne Minster, Dorset]]
The talbot seems to have existed as a breed, a little distinct from the bloodhound, until the end of the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Sydenham Teak (1800), ''Cynographia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; after which, like two other large breeds to which it may have been related, the [[North Country Beagle|Northern]] and the [[Southern Hound]], it disappeared. Some early dog-shows apparently offered classes for talbots, but they were never entered, and so were dropped.

== Cultural legacy ==
"The Talbot" (or "Talbot Arms") is most familiar as the [[pub names|name]] of some English inns or public houses, and it is usually depicted on the signs as a large white hound with hanging ears, sometimes with spots. This suggests that the talbot was quite well known at one time, as part of the idea of a sign was that it helped to identify the inn for the illiterate. 
An inn called ''The Talbot'' in [[Iwerne Minster]], Dorset, UK, showed as its sign a ''black'' dog, apparently the crest of the Bower family, who owned the manor from the late Middle Ages till 1876.&lt;ref name=Iwerne&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrett |first1=Barry|title=Iwerne Minster St Mary's Church &amp; Village Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market town of [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], in the east of the [[United Kingdom]] has a talbot on its town crest, which is also used for a local school and many local sports clubs. The dog is always depicted with its tongue protruding.

The arms of the Carter of Castle Martin family (see [[Carter-Campbell of Possil]]) include a talbot. The arms of the [[Earl Waldegrave|Earls Waldegrave]] is supported by two talbots.

Adding to this, [[Hampton High School (Allison Park, Pennsylvania) | Hampton High School]], a school from the [[Hampton Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania | township of Hampton]], from the small town of [[Allison Park]], [[Pennsylvania]], is the only high school in the United States that has the Talbot as its mascot.

==Company history==
The Hawaii Project was founded in 2014 by Mark Watkins. Prior to The Hawaii Project, he was CEO and co-founder of [[Goby (search engine)]], a mobile recommendation engine for finding things to do, since acquired by Telenav. Prior to that, he was VP of Engineering for Endeca, a search company acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] for $1.075B.&lt;ref name="oracle-acquisition"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/Boston/businessupdates/2011/10/oracle-buys-endeca/tHRB2UzIBhbhkB5V5RhrFN/index.html |title=Oracle buys Endeca |work=Boston.com |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-18 |last=Farrell |first=Michael B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the company was rooted in the founder's frustration at not finding out about new books from his favorite authors.&lt;ref name=bostinno&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/14/best-new-books-the-hawaii-project-tells-you-what-to-read/| title=This New Startup Hunts Down the Books You're Bound to Love| author=Rebecca Strong| date=14 April 2015| publisher=Bost Inno| accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Peasant Dance''''' is an [[oil-on-panel]] by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in c. 1569.  It was looted by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and brought to [[Paris]] in 1808, being returned in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;''[[:it:Danza di contadini|Danza di contadini]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is held by and exhibited at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. 

==Description==
The panel, neither signed nor dated, was painted ''circa'' 1567, at about the same time as ''[[The Peasant Wedding]]''. The paintings are the same size and may have been intended as a pair or as part of a series illustrating peasant life.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti, ''Brueghel'', Skira, Milano 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the two most outstanding examples of Bruegel's late style, which is characterized by his use of monumental [[Italian art|Italianate]] figures.&lt;ref&gt;There is another version of this subject by Bruegel in a painting in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], entitled ''[[The Wedding Dance]]'' (see image at Wikimedia: [[:Commons:File:Brueghel dance 1566 detroit.jpg|"Bruegel dance 1566 Detroit"]]). It is dated 1566 and although the surface is rather worn, it is today generally accepted as an authentic work from Bruegel's own hand. The composition is more crowded and in consequence more effective than the Vienna picture.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Peasant Dance (detail) - WGA3502.jpg|thumb|Detail from leftmost composition]]
Like ''The Peasant Wedding'', it is likely that Bruegel intended this painting to have a moral sense rather than simply being an affectionate portrayal of peasant life. [[Gluttony]], [[lust]] and [[anger]] can all be identified in the picture. The man seated next to the [[bagpipe]] player wears a [[peacock]] feather in his hat, a symbol of vanity and pride.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/~bevans/pieter%20brugel%20grove%20bio.pdf Grove Art Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093519/http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/~bevans/pieter%20brugel%20grove%20bio.pdf |date=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasion for the peasants' revelry is a [[Saint's day]], but dancers turn their backs on the church and pay no attention whatsoever to the image of the Virgin which hangs on the tree. The prominence of the tavern makes it clear that they are preoccupied with material rather than spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Screech|first=Matthew|title=Masters of the ninth art: bandes dessinées and Franco-Belgian identity|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvkGQnWZf1gC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism''''' is 2003 book on [[literary history]], [[Literary criticism|criticism]] and [[Literary theory|theory]] by [[Brent Hayes Edwards]].

==History==
Edwards published ''The Practice of Diaspora'' with [[Harvard University Press]] in 2003.

==Subject matter==
''The Practice of Diaspora'' focuses on black writers in the [[interwar period]]. "Retracing the encounters between black intellectuals from both the [[Anglophone]] and the [[Francophone]] world in Paris, during the early to middle decades of the twentieth century, Edwards is able to make broader theoretical and historical claims for the role of translation in shaping [[Black diaspora|black diasporic cultures]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Michelle|title=The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism (review)|journal=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|date=Fall 2004|volume=50|issue=3|pages=792–794|doi=10.1353/mfs.2004.0090|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172395|accessdate=9 August 2016|issn=1080-658X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards examines works by [[Alain LeRoy Locke|Alain Locke]], [[René Maran]], [[Claude McKay]], and [[Paulette Nardal]] among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.E.B. DuBois]] serves as a point of departure for this transnational examination of black print culture. Edwards observes that DuBois first presented his famed argument, "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the [[Color line (civil rights issue)|color line]]," not in his landmark 1903 text, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' (the usual attribution for that quotation), but in fact three years prior, at the 1900 [[Pan-African Congress]] in [[London]], explicitly framing the "color line" as an issue and a dialogue that crossed national boundaries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to the DuBois reference, Edwards also draws on [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and the concept of [[Articulation (sociology)|articulation]] to develop a theoretical use of the French word décalage, "referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it, and applies the term to describe the way in which members of the black diaspora share similar conditions of oppression yet often find ourselves on opposite ends of the political spectrum—for example, black writers seeking solace from [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Paris, while simultaneously Africans were struggling against [[French colonialism]]. These countering political locations create tensions within our diaspora, but Edwards does not see these sites of difference as global movement killer...[instead] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Kristina Kay|title=My Journey From Louisiana to Havana, and Back Again|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/my-journey-from-louisiana-to-havana-and-back-again/|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=The Nation|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His debut book, ''The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism'', does not disappoint. In its path-breaking take on Black print culture of the 1920s, a decade that witnessed the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and the [[Négritude|Négritude Movement]], ''The Practice of Diaspora'' recalls [[David Levering Lewis]]' seminal history ''[[When Harlem Was In Vogue]]'', while declaring Edwards' brilliance as a literary scholar in his own right."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ards|first1=Angela|title=The Harlem Renaissance and Black Trans-national Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22practice+of+diaspora%22+edwards&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2g4iv5bnOAhVMNxQKHbjtBhcQ6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22practice%20of%20diaspora%22%20edwards&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 August 2016|work=Crisis Magazine|issue=July–August|publisher=The Crisis Publishing Company, Inc.|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:By Carlsberg Glyptotek - troll.jpg|thumb|300px|The troll at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]]

'''{{lang|da|Trold, der vejrer kristenblod}}''' ({{lang-en|Troll that smells Christian blood}}) is a sculpture made by [[Niels Hansen Jacobsen]] (1861–1941). 

It was modelled between 1895–96, and a bronze cast was ordered by brewer [[Carl Jacobsen]] in 1901–02. It was originally placed in front of Jacobsen's church in [[Valby]], [[Copenhagen]], now known as [[Jesus Church, Valby|Jesus Church]], but was too controversial for the parish, so it was moved to the garden of [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]]. In 2002, the church wanted the sculpture back, but the Glyptotek would not part with it, so a copy was made, and placed in front of the church.

The name of the statue is taken from a story in [[Norse folklore]] where the hero hides in the [[troll]]'s castle. Thereafter, whenever the troll enters the castle, he cries: "I smell a Christian man's blood!"

Together with another YouTube mathematics popularizer, [[Matt Parker]], Hart won the 2018 Communications Award of the [[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]] for "entertaining, thought-provoking mathematics and music videos on YouTube that explain mathematical concepts through doodles".{{r|jpbm}}

==Biography==
Hart is the child of mathematical sculptor [[George W. Hart]], and received a degree in music at [[Stony Brook University]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Hart identifies as "gender agnostic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=461633678179696640|user=vihartvihart|title=Fun fact: I consider myself gender agnostic.

Hart's career as a mathematics popularizer began in 2010 with a video series about "doodling in math class". After these [[recreational mathematics]] videos — which introduced topics like [[fractal dimension]] — grew popular, Hart was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and on [[National Public Radio]],&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2010/12/16/132050207/this-is-for-the-i-hate-math-crowd-not-after-this-you-won-t|title=I Hate Math! (Not After This, You Won't)|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually gaining the support of the [[Khan Academy]] and making videos for the educational site as their "Resident Mathemusician".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Khan Academy|title=Announcement|date=2012-01-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWuAYoHysIo|accessdate=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2012/01/learning-on-speed|title=Learning on Speed|last=Gans|first=Joshua|date=2012-01-24|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Hart's videos combined mathematics and music, such as "[[Twelve-tone technique|Twelve tones]]", which was called "deliriously and delightfully profound" by [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/06/28/the_mad_genius_of_vi_hart/|title=The mad genius of Vi Hart|last=Leonard|first=Andrew|date=2013-06-28|work=Salon|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Henry Segerman, Hart wrote "The Quaternion Group as a Symmetry Group", which was included in the anthology ''The Best Writing on Mathematics 2015''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qL7CCgAAQBAJ|title=The Best Writing on Mathematics 2015|last=Hart|first=Vi|last2=Segerman|first2=Henry|date=2016-01-12|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=|isbn=9781400873371|editor-last=Pitici|editor-first=Mircea|location=|pages=141–153|language=en|chapter=The Quaternion Group as a Symmetry Group|arxiv=1404.6596|bibcode=2014arXiv1404.6596H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hart founded a research group called eleVR, with Emily Eifler and Andrea Hawksley, to research [[virtual reality]] (VR). They created VR videos, and had also collaborated on educational computer games.{{r|eleVR|poly|bias|faq|viele}} They created the game Hypernom, where the player has to eat part of [[4-polytope|4 dimensional polytopes]] which are [[Stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] into 3D and viewed using a [[virtual reality headset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawson-Perfect|first1=Christian|title=Hypernom|url=http://aperiodical.com/2015/07/hypernom/|website=The Aperiodical|accessdate=5 April 2016|language=en-US|date=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Hart|first=Vi|last2=Hawksley|first2=Andrea|last3=Segerman|first3=Henry|last4=Bosch|first4=Marc ten|date=2015-07-21|contribution=Hypernom: Mapping VR Headset Orientation to S^3|title=Proceedings of Bridges 2015: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture|volume=|pages=387–390|arxiv=1507.05707|via=|bibcode=2015arXiv150705707H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the group released an [[open source]] web video player that worked with the [[Oculus Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/elevr-the-first-web-video-player-for-virtual-reality/|title=eleVR: the first web video player for virtual reality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Hart created the playable blog post ''[[Parable of the Polygons]]'' with [[Coming Out Simulator 2014|Nicky Case]]. The game was based on economist [[Thomas Schelling]]'s ''Dynamic Models of Segregation''.{{r|poly|poly2}}
In May 2016, eleVR joined [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] Research (YCR) as part of the [[Human Advancement Research Community]] (HARC) project.{{r|leave}} Hart was listed as a Principal Investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Altman|first1=Sam|title=HARC|url=https://blog.ycombinator.com/harc|website=Y Combinator Blog|accessdate=20 June 2016|language=en-US|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed Chilean theater by directing a broad array of works, ranging from locally produced plays to world classics, as well as the experimental work of playwrights such as [[Ann Jellicoe]]. He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the ''[[Nueva Canción Chilena]]'' (New Chilean Song) movement. This led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of President [[Salvador Allende]].

Jara was arrested shortly after the [[1973 coup in Chile|Chilean coup]] of 11 September 1973, which overthrew Allende. He was tortured during interrogations and ultimately shot dead, and his body was thrown out on the street of a shantytown in [[Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;Jara, Joan.

==Early life==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Víctor Jara was born in 1932 in [[Lonquén]], near Santiago, to two farmers, Manuel Jara and Amanda Martínez. His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. He took to drinking and became increasingly violent. His relationship with his wife deteriorated, and he left the family to look for work when Víctor was still a child.

Jara's mother raised him and his siblings, and insisted that they get a good education. A [[mestiza]] with deep [[Araucanian]] roots in southern Chile, she was [[autodidactic|self-taught]], and played the guitar and the piano. She also performed as a singer, with a repertory of traditional folk songs that she used for local functions like weddings and funerals.&lt;ref&gt;Jara, Joan. ''Víctor: An Unfinished Song'', 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

She died when Jara was 15, leaving him to make his own way. He began to study to be an accountant, but soon moved into a [[seminary]], where he studied for the priesthood. After a couple of years, however, he became disillusioned with the [[Catholic Church]] and left the seminary. Subsequently, he spent several years in army service before returning to his hometown to pursue interests in [[folk music]] and [[theatre|theater]].&lt;ref name="notablebiographies.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Victor Jara Biography - life, family, childhood, children, parents, death, wife, school|url = http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Fl-Ka/Jara-Victor.html|website = www.notablebiographies.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work==
After joining the choir at the [[University of Chile]] in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent.&lt;ref name="notablebiographies.com" /&gt; He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''The Lower Depths'', a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.&lt;ref name="notablebiographies.com" /&gt;

In 1957, he met [[Violeta Parra]], a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called ''peñas'' to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumén, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music.&lt;ref name="notablebiographies.com" /&gt; He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], and the poet [[Pablo Neruda]].

In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Peña de Los Parra, owned by [[Ángel Parra]]. Through these activities, he became involved in the [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción]] movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, ''Canto a lo humano'', in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are "Plegaria a un Labrador" ("Prayer to a Worker") and "Te Recuerdo Amanda" ("I Remember You Amanda").

==Political activism==
Early in his recording career, Jara showed a knack for antagonizing conservative Chileans, releasing a traditional comic song called "La beata" that depicted a religious woman with a crush on the priest to whom she goes for [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. The song was banned on radio stations and removed from record shops, but the controversy only added to Jara's reputation among young and progressive Chileans.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;"'They Couldn't Kill His Songs,'" BBC News, World: Americas, http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/165363.stm&lt;/ref&gt; More serious in the eyes of the Chilean right wing was Jara's growing identification with the socialist movement led by [[Salvador Allende]]. After visits to [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1960s, Jara had joined the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]]. The personal met the political in his songs about the poverty he had experienced firsthand.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

Jara's songs spread outside Chile and were performed by American folk artists.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;"Victor Jara," ''All Music Guide'', http://www.allmusic.com (16 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; His popularity was due not only to his songwriting skills but also to his exceptional power as a performer. He took a decisive turn toward political confrontation with his 1969 song "Preguntas por Puerto Montt" ("Questions About Puerto Montt"), which took direct aim at a government official who had ordered police to attack squatters in the town of [[Puerto Montt]]. The Chilean political situation deteriorated after the official was assassinated, and right-wing thugs beat up Jara on one occasion.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com" /&gt;

In 1970, Jara supported Allende, the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition candidate for president, volunteering for political work and playing free concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Jara, Joan. ''Víctor: An Unfinished Song,''&lt;/ref&gt; He composed "[[Venceremos (song)|Venceremos]]" ("We Will Triumph"), the theme song of Allende's Popular Unity movement, and welcomed Allende's election to the Chilean presidency in 1970. After the election, Jara continued to speak in support of Allende and played an important role in the new administration's efforts to reorient Chilean culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mularski, Jedrek. ''Music, Politics, and Nationalism in Latin America: Chile During the Cold War Era''. Amherst: Cambria Press. {{ISBN|9781604978889}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife, [[Joan Jara]], were key participants in a cultural renaissance that swept Chile, organizing cultural events that supported the country's new socialist government. He set poems by Pablo Neruda to music and performed at a ceremony honoring him after Neruda received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1972. Throughout rumblings of a right-wing coup, Jara held on to his teaching job at [[University of Santiago, Chile#Universidad Técnica del Estado|Chile's Technical University]]. His popular success during this time, as both a musician and a Communist, earned him a concert in [[Moscow]]. So successful was he that the Soviet Union tried to latch onto his popularity, claiming in their media that his vocal prowess was the result of surgery he had undergone while in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = OUR MAN IN CHILE, OR VICTOR JARA'S POSTHUMOUS LIFE IN SOVIET MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE|last = Minkova|first = Yuliya|publisher = Virginia Tech|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backed by the United States, which opposed Allende's [[socialist]] politics, the Chilean right wing staged a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état on September 11, 1973]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=The Trial of Henry Kissinger |year=2001 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York |isbn=978-1455522972 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the death of Allende and the installation of [[Augusto Pinochet]] as dictator. At the moment of the coup, Jara was on his way to the Technical University (today the [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile|Universidad de Santiago]]). That night, he slept at the university along with other teachers and students, and sang to raise morale.

==Torture and murder==
After the coup, Pinochet’s soldiers rounded up Chileans who were believed to be involved with leftist groups, including Allende’s Popular Unity party. On the morning of 12 September 1973, Jara was taken prisoner, along with thousands of others, and interned in [[Víctor Jara Stadium|Chile Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/09/world/fg-stadium9|title=Stadium's Renaming an Ode to Singer Martyred There|date=9 September 2003|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Jara|title=Victor Jara - Chilean musician|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guards there tortured him, smashing his hands and fingers, and then mocked him by asking him to play the guitar. Soon after, he was killed with a gunshot to the head, and his body was riddled with more than 40 bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Augustyn, Adam. "Victor Jara Chilean Musician." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d. Web. 9 December 2015.
http://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Jara&lt;/ref&gt;

After his murder, Jara's body was displayed at the entrance of Chile Stadium for other prisoners to see. It was later discarded outside the stadium along with the bodies of other civilian prisoners who had been killed by the Chilean Army.&lt;ref name="Complaint: Jara v. Barriento"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.org/downloads/COMPLAINT.9.4.pdf|title=Complaint: Jara v. Barriento|publisher=Official Florida court legal filing|accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was found by civil servants and brought to a morgue, where a civil servant identified him and contacted his wife, Joan. She took his body and gave him a quick and clandestine burial in the general cemetery before she fled the country into exile.

Forty-five years later, former Chilean military officers were charged with his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Chilean military officers charged in 1973 murder of singer Víctor Jara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/chile-military-officers-victor-jara-killing |accessdate=23 July 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal actions===
On 16 May 2008, retired colonel Mario Manríquez Bravo, who was the chief of security at Chile Stadium as the coup was carried out, was the first to be convicted in Jara's death.&lt;ref name=Jaraconvict&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/446834 |title=Judge rules in Pinochet-era case of murdered singer  |author=Reuters |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Juan Eduardo Fuentes, who oversaw Bravo's conviction, then decided to close the case,&lt;ref name=Jaraconvict /&gt; a decision Jara's family soon appealed.&lt;ref name=Jaraconvict /&gt; In June 2008, Judge Fuentes re-opened the investigation and said he would examine 40 new pieces of evidence provided by Jara's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7435128.stm |work=BBC News |title=New probe into Victor Jara murder |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2009, José Adolfo Paredes Márquez, a 54-year-old former Army conscript arrested the previous week in [[San Sebastián, Chile]], was formally charged with Jara's murder. Following his arrest, on 1 June 2009, the police investigation identified the officer who had shot Jara in the head. The officer played [[Russian roulette]] with Jara by placing a single round in his revolver, spinning the cylinder, placing the muzzle against Jara's head, and pulling the trigger. The officer repeated this a couple of times until a shot fired and Jara fell to the ground. The officer then ordered two conscripts (one of them Paredes) to finish the job by firing into Jara's body. A judge ordered Jara's body to be [[Exhumation|exhumed]] in an effort to gather more information about his death.&lt;ref name="exhumed"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8084201.stm |title=Chilean singer Jara is exhumed |date=2009-06-04 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A oficial que ajustició a Víctor Jara, le decían &amp;quot;El Loco&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite web |title=A oficial que ajustició a Víctor Jara, le decían "El Loco" |url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090601/pags/20090601020443.html |work=Red Nacion |accessdate=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017063426/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090601/pags/20090601020443.html |archive-date=17 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Rory |title=Ex-Pinochet army conscript charged with folk singer Victor Jara's murder |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/28/chile-regime-murder-charge-victor-jara |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2009, Jara was reburied after a massive funeral in the [[Galpón Víctor Jara]], across from Santiago's [[Plaza Brasil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/05/chile-a-proper-funeral-for-victor-jara/ |title=Chile: A Proper Funeral for Víctor Jara |date=2009-12-05 |publisher=[[Global Voices Online]] |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2012, a judge in Chile ordered the arrest of eight former army officers for alleged involvement in Jara's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |title=Charges brought in Chilean singer's death, 39 years later |author=Mariano Castillo |date=29 December 2012 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/29/world/americas/chile-victor-jara-charges/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20861432 |title=Ex-army officers implicated in Victor Jara death |publisher=BBC |date=2012-12-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He issued an international arrest warrant for one of them, Pedro Barrientos Núñez, the man accused of shooting Jara in the head during a torture session.

On 4 September 2013, [[Chadbourne &amp; Parke]] attorneys Mark D. Beckett&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chadbourne.com/mbeckett|title=Mark D.

The suit accused Barrientos of arbitrary detention; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; [[extrajudicial killing]]; and [[crimes against humanity]] under the [[Alien Tort Statute]] (ATS), and of torture and extrajudicial killing under the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] (TVPA). It alleged that Barrientos was liable for Jara's death as a direct perpetrator and as a commander.&lt;ref name="Complaint: Jara v. Barriento" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jara v. Barrientos No. 3:13-cv-1075-J-99MMH-JBT (2013). |url=http://cja.org/article.php?id=1361 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |newspaper=Center for Justice and Accountability |date=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific claims were that:
* On 11 September 1973, troops from the [[Arica]] regiment of the Chilean Army, specifically from [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], attacked the university where Jara taught. The troops prohibited civilians from entering or leaving the university premises. During the afternoon of 12 September 1973, military personnel entered the university and illegally detained hundreds of professors, students, and administrators. Víctor Jara was among those arbitrarily detained on the campus and was subsequently transferred to Chile Stadium, where he was tortured and killed. 
* In the course of transporting and processing the civilian prisoners, Captain Fernando Polanco Gallardo, a commanding officer in military intelligence, recognized Jara as the well-known folk singer whose songs addressed social inequality, and who had supported President Allende's government. Captain Polanco separated Jara from the group and beat him severely. He then transferred Jara, along with some of the other civilians, to the stadium.
* Throughout his detention in the locker room of the stadium, Jara was in the physical custody of Lieutenant Barrientos, soldiers under his command, or other members of the Chilean Army who acted in accordance with the army's plan to commit human rights abuses against civilians.
* The arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing of Jara and other detainees were part of a widespread, systematic attack on civilians by the Chilean Army from 11–15 September 1973. Barrientos knew, or should have known, about these attacks, if for no other reason than that he was present for and participated in them.&lt;ref name="Complaint: Jara v. Barriento" /&gt;

On 15 April 2015, a US judge ordered Barrientos to stand trial in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Victor Jara killing: Chile ex-army officer faces US trial |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32328555 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2016, he was found liable for Jara's killing, and the jury awarded Jara's family $28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luscombe|first=Richard|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/victor-jara-pedro-pablo-barrientos-nunez-killing-chile |title=Former Chilean military official found liable for killing of Victor Jara|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2016|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2018, eight retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to 15 years in prison for Jara's murder, with a ninth suspect sentenced to 5 years in prison for their role in covering up the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1-last=De la Jara|author2-last=Laing|author1-first=Antonio|author2-first=Aislinn|title=Eight Chilean military officers sentenced for singer Victor Jara's murder |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-rights-jara/eight-chilean-military-officers-sentenced-for-singer-victor-jaras-murder-idUSKBN1JT2X1 |work=Reuters|date=3 July 2018|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Joan Jara currently lives in Chile and runs the Víctor Jara Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sreyes.org/old/vjfndt.htm|title=FUNDACION VICTOR JARA|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established on 4 October 1994 with the goal of promoting and continuing Jara's work. She publicized a poem that Jara wrote before his death about the conditions of the prisoners in the stadium. The poem, written on a piece of paper that was hidden inside the shoe of a friend, was never named, but it is commonly known as "[[Estadio Chile (poem)|Estadio Chile]]". (Chile Stadium, now known as Víctor Jara Stadium,&lt;ref&gt;Waldstein, David. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 June 2015. Web. 9 December 2015. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/sports/soccer/in-chiles-national-stadium-dark-past-shadows-copa-america-matches.html?_r=1 In Chile’s National Stadium, Dark Past Shadows Copa América Matches]"&lt;/ref&gt; is often confused with the [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|Estadio Nacional]], or National Stadium.)

Joan also distributed recordings of her husband's music, which became known worldwide. His music began to resurface in Chile in 1981. Nearly 800 cassettes of early, nonpolitical Jara songs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=E.|first=Morris, Nancy|date=1 July 1984|title=Canto porque es necesario cantar: The New Song Movement in Chile, 1973-1983|url=http://repository.unm.edu/handle/1928/9709|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were confiscated on the "grounds that they violated an internal security law". The importer was given jail time but released six months later. By 1982, Jara’s records were being openly sold throughout Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Nancy E.

Jara is one of many ''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]'' (people who vanished under the Pinochet government and were most likely tortured and killed) whose families are still struggling to get justice.&lt;ref name="Charged"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/23/10-former-chilean-officers-charged-in-victor-jara|title=10 Former Chilean Soldiers Charged in Victor Jara Killing|date=July 23, 2015|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=June 14, 2016|author=Henao, Luis A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-six years after his first burial, he received a full funeral on 3 December 2009 in Santiago.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Long, Gideon. ''The Guardian''. Guardian News and Media Limited, 5 December 2009. Web. 8 December 2015. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/06/victor-jara-folk-singer-chile-/?page=all Murdered Chilean Folk Singer Laid to Rest after 36 Years]"&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Chileans attended his reburial, after his body was exhumed, to pay their respects. President [[Michelle Bachelet]]—also a victim of the Pinochet regime, having spent years in exile—said: "Finally, after 36 years, Victor can rest in peace. He is a hero for the left, and he is known worldwide, even though he continues buried in the general cemetery where his widow originally buried him."

Jara has been commemorated not only by Latin American artists, but also by global bands such as [[U2]] and [[The Clash]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; U2 has given concerts at Chile' [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|National Stadium]] in homage not only to Jara, but also to the many others who suffered under the Pinochet dictatorship.

Although most of the master recordings of Jara's music were burned under Pinochet's military dictatorship, his wife managed to get recordings out of Chile, which were later copied and distributed worldwide. She later wrote an account of Jara's life and music titled ''Víctor: An Unfinished Song''.

Since his death, Jara has been honored in numerous ways:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4679">'''Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN)''' is a national organization dedicated to preserving African American quiltmaking. 

==History==
The Women of Color Quilters Network was founded in 1986 by [[Carolyn L. Mazloomi]].

For many years in the early 1980s Mazloomi had tried unsuccessfully to expand her circle of African American quilters. She eventually placed an advertisement in Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine requesting correspondence with other quilters who shared this frustration. She received several responses to this advertisement, and the resulting correspondence led to the formation of the Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN).&lt;ref&gt; Quilter’s Exchange – Needle and Pin Pals.” Quilters Newsletter Magazine, February 1986, p. 41. Carolyn Mazloomi wishes to correspond with “Black quilters worldwide.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding members of the WCQN included Carolyn, Claire E. Carter, aRma Carter, [[Cuesta Benberry]], Meloydy Boyd, [[Michael_Cummings_(quilter)|Michael Cummings]], [[Peggie Hartwell]] and Marie Wilson.

In 1992-1993, a survey of WCQN members, conducted by quilter Sandra German, indicated members had low expectations for fairness, acceptance, and success from traditional or mainstream quilting ventures (e.g., quilt guilds, magazines, contests).&lt;ref&gt; “Surfacing: The Inevitable Rise of the Women of Color Quilters’ Network” In Uncovering 1993, ed. Laurel Horton, pp. 137 – 168. San Francisco: American Quilt Study Group, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The objectives of the organization include the fostering and preservation of the art of quilt making among women and men of color, researching quilt history and documenting quilts, and offering authentic, handmade African American quilts and fiber art to museums and galleries for exhibition.

WCQN membership surpassed 1,000 quilters from the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean and England. &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Charles. “What’s New and News in Quilting – Women of Color Network Membership Approaches 1,000.” Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine, May 1996, p. 7. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; German, Sandra K. “Surfacing: The Inevitable Rise of the Women of Color Quilters’ Network” In Uncovering 1993, ed. Laurel Horton, pp. 137 – 168. San Francisco: American Quilt Study Group, 1994.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Many members specialize in narrative quilts on contemporary African-American themes because, as Mazloomi pointed out, "we are a people with many stories to tell."&lt;ref&gt; Life's Thread Stitched Into Quilts,” by Patricial Leigh Brown, New York Times, April 04, 1996.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dfaPC_WSlNwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=WCQN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BKMQd3NQh4&amp;sig=_GS40MQydm2rr06o5sikaoch6Ns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=txRoUfO-GKOOyAGr8oDICQ&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=WCQN&amp;f=false Crafted Lives] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

WCQN members continue to exhibit their quilts in community venues, local galleries and museums. In 2004, the Museum of Biblical Art sponsored the traveling exhibition, Threads of Faith: Recent Works from the Women of Color Quilters Network. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mobia.org/exhibitions/threads-of-faith#slideshow1 Museum of Biblical Arts, Past Exhibitions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12752">[[Image:yves-cover.jpg|thumb|right|220 px|''Yves Peintures'' by Yves Klein 1954]]
'''''Yves Peintures''''' (Eng: ''Yves Paintings'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]], originally published in [[Madrid]], 18 November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Stich, p42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html According to the Klein Archive, the book was published May 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This publication was Klein’s first public gesture as an artist, featuring pages of 'commercially printed papers &lt;ref name="tate"&gt;Tate Liverpool, text taken from the 'Reinventing Colour' exhibition, May-Sept, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;' that were seemingly reproductions of paintings that, in fact, didn't exist. Using a practice started by [[Marcel Duchamp]], this use of [[readymade]] objects to represent nothing but themselves has been referred to as an early example of [[Postmodernism]],&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, T. Yves Klein: Messenger of the Age of Space. Artforum 20, no.5. January 1982. pp. 38-51&lt;/ref&gt; using a series of carefully executed strategies to undermine its own authority, and as a precursor to [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; 'The simplicity of his [[Found object|readymade]]s is at once sublime and mischievous.' &lt;ref name="tate"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The booklet asserts its character straightaway in the preface: a wordless text of unbroken horizontal lines with the same two paragraph indentations on each page.... a homogenous continuum with no real beginning, middle, or end, and no content - at least insofar as there are no descriptions, analyses, or personalized utterances. The colour plates are similarly presented as anonymous entities, each a flat spatial field of an uninflected hue: turquoise, brown, purple, green, pink, gray, yellow, ultramarine, mint, orange, or red.  Here, too, there is no attempt to represent or symbolize anything....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The booklet thus offers an utterly pared down presentation. Unlike most art books, it provides no reverential prose about the artist or the art, and no embellishing descriptions meant to convey meaning or context. Instead the booklet itself is made into a work of art that shares the same spirit of nothingness exemplified by the monochrome paintings that it features." Sidra Stich &lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The origins of the Monochrome==

===Zen Philosophy and Kōdōkan Judo===
[[Image:YvesPeinturesNice.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Yves Peintures'', showing 'Nice, 1951']]
Klein had painted his first monochromes - paintings consisting of a single colour - whilst working in a framing shop in London in late 1949 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html Yves Klein Archives, Biography&lt;/ref&gt; which he exhibited in his room privately, inviting only friends. Initially influenced by his readings of [[Max Heindel|Max Heindel's]] ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity'', which taught that 'space equals spirit and life, that matter is inert form, [and] that sponges and water symbolize the saturation of matter with spirit,&lt;ref name="Berggruen"&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Cantz, p216&lt;/ref&gt; he later rejected these teachings for a more rigorous study of the philosophy behind [[Judo]], which involved long periods of meditation with his friends [[Arman]] and Claude Pascal.

His second private exhibition of monochromes took place whilst Klein was in [[Tokyo]], late 1953, around the same time as he earned a diploma from the [[Kodokan|Kōdōkan Institute]], as a fourth degree [[Dan (rank)|Dan]], achieving the highest level possible for a European.&lt;ref name="Berggruen" /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The philosophy of [[Zen]], which is essentially prevalent in Kōdōkan judo, being primarily concerned with an increased sensitivity for the present and an extended concept of space and time, [meant] a new form of spirituality for Klein, and [had] a direct effect upon his artistic activities.' &lt;ref name="Berggruen" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Upon his return to Paris in February 1954, he was deeply upset to discover that his diploma would not be officially recognised by the French Federation of Judo, meaning he could not officially teach or effectively participate in French Judo activities.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p39&lt;/ref&gt; He responded by publishing a book, ''Les Fondements du Judo'', (see [http://www.theeverydaypress.net/]), studying six Katas formulated by [[Kanō Jigorō]] in the 19th century, in an attempt to establish a reputation in France by circumventing the federation. Unable to teach in France, he took a post in [[Madrid]] in May. It was whilst he was in Spain that he formulated and published his first public gesture as an artist: ''Yves Peintures''.

===The Book Itself===
''Yves Peintures'' is a small booklet, 24.4&amp;nbsp;cm by 19.7&amp;nbsp;cm, containing 16 sheets of unbound paper, each printed on one side only and 10 containing tipped-in sheets of coloured paper. Starting with a preface of 3 pages consisting entirely of horizontal black lines designed to parody a traditional introduction credited to ‘Pascal Claude’, (Claude Pascal, a close friend of Klein’s), the introduction was actually designed by Klein himself, persuading Pascal to sign it to ‘certify the production’.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p42&lt;/ref&gt;
10 vivid monochromatic plates follow, mechanically signed ‘Yves’, each given unspecified numerical dimensions and assigned a large city.

If, as is usual in exhibition catalogues, the dimensions refer to centimetres, the plates would represent medium-sized easel paintings; if metres, large [[frescoes]]; if millimetres, then the plates are life size, leading to the conclusion that, rather than illustrations, they are the work itself. Klein would later create work in all three categories.

The cities are all places Klein had lived and worked in the preceding 4 years, implying either that the idea for each work had come to him in the relevant city, or that the work was an abstract representation of the city’s atmosphere. There are three versions of the book; one in which the plates have the name Yves next to the cities with a date; one with additional information about the size of each work, and one in which the entire work is credited to 'Haguenault'.

''Haguenault Peintures'' is basically the same book, and was published at the same time, but attributed to a different, unknown, artist. Curiously, some of the plates are still mechanically signed ‘Yves’, part of a series of deliberate strategies to undermine the works’ integrity, leading some critics, such as Pierre Restany, to call Klein an early post-modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, quoted in Yves Klein, Jean-Paul Ledeur, Editions Guy Pieters, p66&lt;/ref&gt; The main structural difference was the accrediting of ownership in the captions (Collection Particuliere, Collection Orickson, Collection Raymond Hains, etc.).&lt;ref name="Yves Klein 1995, p46"&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p46&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the (fictional) artist was a painter of some stature, with work collected in major collections. 
According to [[Raymond Hains]], a close friend of Klein's at the time, Klein had named his pseudonym after a brand of gingerbread.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, 1928-1962, Selected Writings, Tate Gallery p82&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“ The fact that there were two different monochrome artists featured in two nearly identical booklets augmented the manifestations of doubling, duplication and duplicity that lay at the core of the project.” Sidra Stich&lt;ref name="Yves Klein 1995, p46" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influences ==

===Lettrism and the Readymade===
Klein was in contact at this time with key advocates of [[Lettrism]], a group of French avant garde artists who were challenging the assumed authority of texts by creating ‘an experiential language that was to be the basis of (the) new culture.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://cotati.sjsu.edu/spoetry/folder4/ng441.html Lettrism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509090049/http://cotati.sjsu.edu/spoetry/folder4/ng441.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952, he had seen various works by key members of the group, including [[Isidore Isou]], and by Dufrêne, [[Gil J. Wolman]] &amp; [[Guy Debord]],&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery p31&lt;/ref&gt; and had become a close friend of Dufrêne in particular. The lettrists advocated challenging textual authority, and would serve as a direct reference point for the introduction. He was also familiar with the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], having given a copy of the 1947 artist's book ''Le Surrealisme'', designed by Duchamp with a famous cover of a 3D breast, to his friend [[Arman]]. Duchamp's theories about the [[readymade]], and his belief in the viewer making the meaning of a work of art, would be central to ''Yves Peintures''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/klein.shtm Tate Liverpool, Colour Chart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627220435/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/klein.shtm |date=June 27, 2009 }}, retrieved 08-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'[Klein] dismissed line as a ‘tourist walking across the space’. For him lines were a ‘prison grating’, whereas the fine individual particles of colour were an expression of ‘total freedom’. He attempted to free himself from all materiality through the totality of colour. In gold, red and especially dark, deep ultramarine blue he found colours that corresponded adequately to his visions of the immaterial and the infinite. He wanted to induce independent sensations, feelings and reactions in viewers without giving them a depicted object or an abstract sign as a starting-point, just by means of the state and effect of the colour. He saw monochrome as an ‘open window to freedom, as the possibility of being immersed in the immeasurable existence of colour’ Ulrike Lehmann &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Lehmann, Yves Klein, Grove Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Editions===
The book was published by Fernando Franco de Sarabia’s engraving workshop in Jaen near Madrid, in a numbered edition of 150;&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Cantz, p216-7&lt;/ref&gt; despite this, there are believed to only be around 10 copies in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozanne-rarebooks.com/ Denis Ozanne Rarebooks, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yves Peintures'' has since been re-published by Editions Dilecta, Paris in 2006 in an edition of 400.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editions-dilecta.com/ Éditions Dilecta - Maison d'édition - Histoire des idées - Anthropologie de la culture - Société contemporaine - Rééditions de prestige&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The book seems to have had a small but influential impact on the Parisian Art scene; using ''Yves Peintures'' to gain entry into the Parisian art world,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p57&lt;/ref&gt; he managed to secure an exhibition of monochromes at the Club Des Solitaires, Paris, opening on October 15, 1955.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Yesterday night, Wednesday, we went into an abstract café… the abstractionists were there. They are easy to recognize because they give off an atmosphere of abstract painting, plus you see their paintings in their eyes. Maybe I’m delirious, but I have the impression I see things like that. In any event, we sat down with them. Then we began speaking of the book ''Yves Peintures''. Later, I went to get it from the car and I laid it down on the table. At the very first few pages the abstractionists’ eyes began to change. Their eyes lit up and in the depths, pure, beautiful single colors appeared.' Paris newspaper, dated January 13, 1955 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_content_us.html Klein Archives, retrieved 08-07-2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705023902/http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_content_us.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zemun fortress''' is a fortification located on a hill in [[Zemun]] in Belgrade.

== History ==

Zemun's medieval walls were built on top of the old Celtic, and then Roman town of Taurunum. The medieval walls are believed to be built by the Byzantine Empire. The first written mentions of the fortress are from 9th century, and in late 11th century it suffered great damage during the [[First Crusade]]. During the first half of 12th century, the town is repeatedly mentioned in relation to Byzantine-Hungarian clashes. [[John Kinnamos]] mentions that in 1127 the Hungarians captured the [[Belgrade Fortress]], stripping it's materials and using stone to build the Zemun fortress. A few decades later, [[Manuel I Komnenos]] took Zemun, and reversed the process. He took stones off the Zemun walls, transported them to the other side of the riverbank, and refortified Belgrade. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] additionally destroy the town in 1397.

In 1411, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund, the Holy Roman Emperor]] cedes Zemun to despot [[Stefan Lazarević]]. In 1441, it comes under the possession of [[Đurađ Branković]].

On 11 of August 1456, it was here where [[John Hunyadi]], the famous regent of Hungary, succumbed to his wounds during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]]. As there were far too many unburied corpses of fighters around the tower, plague hit the army and the regent shared the same fate as his ill soldiers.

The Ottomans capture Zemun in 1521, in a fierce battle against the Serbian regiments under Marko Skoblić. Since 18th century, Zemun fortress is in remains.

== Characteristics ==

Today, there are remains of square citadel, with four large circular towers in the corners. The length of each wall of the citadel is around 45 meters.
