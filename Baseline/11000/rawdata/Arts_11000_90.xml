There are few survivals of ancient Greek and Roman [[furniture]], but a number of images in [[relief]]s, painted pottery and other media. It was normally made of wood, but expensive examples were often fitted with metalwork elements, which have a better chance of survival. The styles were generally rather light and elegant in upper-class furniture, and by modern standards apparently not heavily upholstered. Some items entirely in metal, such as lampstands, braziers and stands for sacrifice, have survived, and some covered by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] have either been carbonized or left hollows in the volcanic rock that can be used as moulds for [[plaster of Paris]], allowing a clear idea of their original form.  The rich had tables and chairs supported by marble, and some of these have survived. [[Wicker]] was widely used for [[armchair (furniture)|armchairs]].

==Greek furniture==
'''Ancient Greek furniture''' was typically constructed out of wood, though it might also be made of stone or metal, such as bronze, iron, gold and silver. Little wood survives from [[ancient Greece]], though varieties mentioned in texts concerning Greece and Rome include maple, oak, beech, yew, and willow.&lt;ref&gt;G.M.A. Richter, ''The Furniture of the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans'' (London: Phaidon, 1966), 122. First published in 1926 with an updated version in 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces were assembled using [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joinery, held together with lashings, pegs, metal nails, and glue. Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, furniture could be veneered with expensive types of wood in order to make the object appear more costly,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; though classical furniture was often pared down in comparison to objects attested in the East, or those from earlier periods in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanus T. A. M. Mols, ''Wooden Furniture in Herculaneum: Form, Technique and Function'', in  vol. 2 of Circumvesuviana (Amsterdam: Gieben, 1999), 10. These relatively simple varieties of furniture may be connected to ancient Greek sumptuary laws. The effects of these laws on craftsmen are discussed by Alison Burford in ''Craftsmen in Greek and Roman Society'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1972), 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive research was done on the forms of Greek furniture by [[Gisela Richter]], who utilized a typological approach based primarily on illustrated examples depicted in Greek art, and it is from Richter’s account that the main types can be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;See section on “Greek Furniture” in Richter, 13-84, in which the author describes Greek furniture and its typology.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek seating===
[[File:Parthenon frieze east IV fragment.JPG|thumb|left|Block IV from the east frieze of the Parthenon, with images of seated gods, ca. 447–433 BCE.]]

The modern word “[[throne]]” is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: θρόνος), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Less extravagant though more influential in later periods is the ''[[klismos]]'' (Greek singular: κλισμός), an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design. A fine example is shown on the grave stele of Hegeso, dating to the late fifth century B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Maria Gigante, “Funerary Art,” in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 246.&lt;/ref&gt; As with earlier furniture from the east, the ''klismos'' and ''thronos'' could be accompanied by footstools.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of footstools outlined by Richter – those with plain straight legs, those with curved legs, and those shaped like boxes that would have sat directly on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of Greek seat was the backless stool, which must have been found in every Greek home. These were apparently known as [[Diphros|''diphroi'']] (Greek singular: δίφρος), and were easily portable.&lt;ref&gt;E. Guhl, and W. Koner, ''Everyday Life in Greek and Roman Times'' (New York: Crescent, 1989), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]] displays numerous examples, upon which the gods are seated.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Simpson, “Furniture,” in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Several fragments of a stool were discovered in a fourth-century B.C.E. tomb in [[Thessaloniki]], including two of the legs and four transverse stretchers. Once made of wood and covered in silver foil, all that remains of this piece are the parts made of precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitra Andrianou, ''The Furniture and Furnishings of Ancient Greek Houses and Tombs'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009) 28-29, figure 6a.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Greek furniture 002.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[symposium]]]]

The folding stool, known as the ''diphros okladias'' (Greek singular: δίφρος ὀκλαδίας), was practical and portable. The Greek folding stool survives in numerous depictions, indicating its popularity in the Archaic and Classical periods; the type may have been derived from earlier Minoan and Mycenaean examples, which in turn were likely based on Egyptian models.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Wanscher, ''Sella Curulis: The Folding Stool, an Ancient Symbol of Dignity'' (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1980), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek folding stools might have plain straight legs or curved legs that typically ended in animal feet.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klinai===
[[File:Locri Pinax Persephone Opens Liknon Mystikon.jpg|thumb|Relief with [[Persephone]]]]
A couch or [[Klinai|''kline'']] (Roman singular: κλίνη) was a form used in Greece as early as the late seventh century B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kline'' was rectangular and supported on four legs, two of which could be longer than the other, providing support for an armrest or headboard. Three types are distinguished by Richter – those with animal legs, those with “turned” legs, and those with “rectangular” legs, although this terminology is somewhat problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 54; Richter defines “turned” (as in lathe-turned) legs on page 19 as being tripartite, with a middle “lozenge-shaped” portion capped by conical, “flaring” pieces at either end. This terminology is problematic in that it implies woodworking techniques, while the “turned” leg could have been executed in other materials, such as stone, metal, or ivory. Richter defines “rectangular” legs on page 23 as those that are “straight” though these can be curved and footed, and often decorated with palettes and volutes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabric would have been draped over the woven platform of the couch, and cushions would have been placed against the arm or headrest, making the Greek couch an item well suited for a [[symposium]] gathering. The foot of a bronze bed discovered in situ in the House of the Seals at [[Delos]] provides an indication of how the “turned” legs of a ''kline'' might have appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Andrianou, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous images of ''klinai'' are displayed on vases, topped by layers of intricately woven fabrics and pillows. These furnishings would have been made of leather, wool, or linen, though silk could also have been used. Stuffing for pillows, cushions, and beds could have been made of wool, feathers, leaves, or hay.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek tables===
In general, Greek tables (Greek singular: τράπεζα, τρἰπους, τετράπους, φάτνη, ὲλεóς) were low and often appear in depictions alongside ''klinai'' and could perhaps fit underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs, though numerous configurations exist. Tables could have circular tops, and four legs or even one central leg instead of three. Tables in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes – in depictions of banquets, it appears as though each participant would have utilized a single table, rather than a collective use of a larger piece. On such occasions, tables would have been moved according to one's needs.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tables also would have figured prominently in religious contexts, as indicated in vase paintings. One example by the Chicago Painter from The Art Institute of Chicago, dating to around 450 B.C.E., shows an image of three women performing a Dionysian ritual, in which a table functions as an appropriate place to rest a ''kantharos'' – a wine vessel associated with Dionysus.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Painter, stamnos, ca. 450 B.C.E. [http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/177 The Art Institute of Chicago, 1889.22].&lt;/ref&gt; Other images indicate that tables could range in style from the highly ornate to the relatively unadorned.

==Roman furniture==
[[File:Herculaneum Casa del Tramezzo di Legno Letto.jpg|thumb|left|Carbonized bed from the Casa del Tramezzo di Legno in [[Herculaneum]]]]

To a large extent, the types and styles of ancient Roman furniture followed those of their Classical and Hellenistic Greek predecessors. Because of this it is difficult to differentiate Roman forms from earlier Hellenistic ones in many cases. [[Gisela Richter]]’s typological approach is useful in tracing developments of Greek furniture into Roman expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 97-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of Roman furniture is derived mainly from depictions in [[fresco]]es and representations in sculpture, along with actual pieces of furniture, fragments, and fittings, several of which were preserved by the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79. The most well-known archaeological sites with preserved images and fragments from the eruption are [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] in [[Italy]]. There are fine examples of reconstructed Roman furniture at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] as well as the [[Capitoline Museum]] in [[Rome]].

===Chairs===
The ''sella'', or stool or chair, was the most common type of seating in the Roman period, probably because of its easy portability. In addition, the ''sella'' in its simplest form was inexpensive to make. Both slaves and emperors used it, although those of the poor were surely plain, while the wealthy had access to precious woods, ornamented with inlay, metal fittings, ivory, and silver and gold leaf. Bronze ''sellae'' from Herculaneum were square in form and had straight legs, decorative stretchers, and a dished seat.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Pirzio Biroli Stefanelli, ''Il bronzo dei romani: arredo e suppellettile'' (Rome: L’Erma" di Bretschneider, 1991), 140-142.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sella Curulis|''sella curulis'']], or folding stool, was an important indicator of power in the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Wanscher, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; There were ''sellae'' resembling both stools and chairs that folded in a scissor fashion to facilitate transport.&lt;ref&gt;Roger B. Ulrich, ''Roman Woodworking'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007), 221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Triclinium - Archäologische Staatssammlung München.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed [[triclinium]] or dining room, with three ''[[klinai]]'' or couches]]
[[File:Brasero de Pompeya.jpg|thumb|Metal [[brazier]] with [[satyr]]s, from [[Pompei]]]]

The Roman ''cathedra'' was a chair with a back, although there is disagreement as to the exact meaning of the Latin term. Richter defines the ''cathedra'' as a later version of the Greek ''klismos'', which she says was never as popular as its Greek predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 101; Ulrich, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  A. T. Croom, however, considers the ''cathedra'' to be a high-backed wickerwork chair that was typically associated with women. They have also been seen being used as early school teachers, pupils would sit around him in this chair while he taught. It showed who held the seat of power in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Croom, ''Roman Furniture'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire, Great Britain: Tempus, 2007), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  As with Greek furniture, the names of various Roman types as found in texts cannot always be associated with known furniture forms with certainty.

The Latin ''solium'' is considered to be equivalent to the Greek term ''thronos'' and thus is often translated as “throne.”&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 98; Ulrich, 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were like modern chairs, with backs and arm rests. Three types of ''solia'' based on Greek prototypes are distinguished by Richter: thrones with “turned” and “rectangular” legs and grandiose thrones with solid sides, of which several examples remain in stone.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a type with a high back and arms, resting upon a cylindrical or conical base, is said to derive from Etruscan prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 10. According to Ulrich, Pliny uses the Greek term ''cathedra'' instead of ''solium'' for wicker armchairs, 215-218. Croom, however, refers to this chair as ''cathedra'' on p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Couches===
Few actual Roman couches survive, although sometimes the bronze fittings do, which help with the reconstruction of the original forms. While in wealthy households beds were used for sleeping in the bedrooms (''lectus cubicularis''), and couches for banqueting while reclining were used in the dining rooms (''lectus tricliniaris''), the less well off might use the same piece of furniture for both functions.&lt;ref&gt;Croom, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two types might be used interchangeably even in richer households, and it is not always easy to differentiate between sleeping and dining furniture. The most common type of Roman bed took the form of a three-sided, open rectangular box, with the fourth (long) side of the bed open for access.  While some beds were framed with boards, others had slanted structures at the ends, called ''fulcra'', to better accommodate pillows. The ''fulcra'' of elaborate dining couches often had sumptuous decorative attachments featuring ivory, bronze, copper, gold or silver ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bench, or ''subsellium'', was an elongated stool for two or more users. Benches were considered to be “seats of the humble,” and were used in peasant houses, farms, and bathhouses. However, they were also found in lecture halls, in the vestibules of temples, and served as the seats of senators and judges. Roman benches, like their Greek precedents, were practical for the seating of large groups of people and were common in theaters, amphitheaters, odeons and auctions.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 104; Croom, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''scamnum'', related to the ''subsellium'' but smaller, was used as both a bench and a footstool.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tables===
Types of Roman tables include the ''abacus'' and the ''mensa'', which are distinguished from one another in Latin texts. The term ''abacus'' might be used for utilitarian tables, such as those for making shoes or kneading dough, as well as high-status tables, such as sideboards for the display of silver.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;  A low, three-legged table, thought to represent the ''mensa delphica'', was often depicted next to reclining banqueters in Roman paintings. This table has a round tabletop supported by three legs configured like those of a tripod.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several wooden tables of this type were recovered from Herculaneum.

===Remainings===
The most important source for wooden furniture of the Roman period is the collection of carbonized furniture from [[Herculaneum]]. While the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 C.E. was tremendously destructive to the region, the hot liquid lava that engulfed the town of Herculaneum ultimately preserved the wooden furniture, shelves, doors, and shutters in carbonized form.&lt;ref&gt;Mols, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Their preservation, however, is imperiled, as some of the pieces remain in situ in their houses and shops, encased in unprotected glass or entirely open and accessible. Upon excavation, much of the furniture was conserved with paraffin wax mixed with carbon powder, which coats the wood and obscures important details such as decorations and joinery. It is now impossible to remove the wax coating without further damaging the furniture. Several wooden pieces were found with bone and metal fittings.&lt;ref&gt;Mols, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden shelving and racks are fund in shops and kitchens in the Vesuvian sites, and one house has elaborate wooden room dividers.

The '''Architecture of [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}}''' dates back to the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Period]] and includes the [[Chalcolithic|Copper]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages|Medieval period]]. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilizations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day. Local builders have combined building techniques of conquering empires with the materials at hand and the existing conditions to develop their own varieties of dwellings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Monastery|Monasteries]] and Churches from the 14th century represent the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] legacy. Architectural heritage from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Period]] includes mosques and [[Turkish bath|hamams]] from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include [[Monuments of Kosovo|kullas]] from the 18th and 19th centuries as well as a number of bridges, urban centers and fortresses. While some [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular buildings]] are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the [[Kosovo War|1999 conflict in Kosovo]], many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prioritized Intervention List|journal=Regional programme for cultural and natural heritage in south-east europe|date=23 January 2009|page=8|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/countries/kosovo_en.asp|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultural Heritage in South-East: Kosovo|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|page=5|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dukagjini region, at least 500 kullas were attacked, and most of them destroyed or otherwise damaged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the 1990s and thereafter, thousands of illegal buildings have been built in Kosovo. Rexhep Luci, the urban planner of Pristina who started an initiative to face this problem was killed in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tawil|first=Edward|title=Property rights in Kosovo: A haunting legacy of a society in transition.|url=http://ictj.org/publication/property-rights-kosovo-haunting-legacy-society-transition|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==

Ancient [[Ulpiana]] was a settlement of religious and cultural importance in the [[Roman Empire]], that was active from the 1st to 7th centuries. Destroyed in an earthquake in 518, the settlement was later rebuilt by the Emperor [[Justinian I]]. The city had a sustainable urban scheme typical of a Roman city in terms of street layout and water supply. It also had 3&amp;nbsp;meter thick city walls with [[Watchtower|watch towers]] and 5&amp;nbsp;meter wide castle gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kosova - Vështrim Monografik|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave dhe e Arteve e Kosovës|location=Prishtinë|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Ulpiana, another notable city from the Roman Period is the [[Municipium Dardanorum]]. Among the remaining sites from this city are the [[Forum (Roman)]], the Basilica, the temple and other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kosova - Vështrim Monografik|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave dhe e Arteve e Kosovës|location=Prishtinë|page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the geo-physical research made by an Albanian archaeologist and also foreigners, have been found out that there are more than 100 ha worth objects that Ulpiana lies in. On the north side of the city is the cemetery,where there have been found lots of objects:the foundations of a [[Basilica]] ([[Paleolithic]]-Christian) of early Christianity build in the beginning of the 4th century by [[Emperor Justinian]]. Also found is the north entry of the city with its walls and a memorium, a room or a form of funeral. The ruins of a building with a beautiful mosaic are found in the south of the city. The research was mainly focused on the antic objects which have been found on the sides of the main road which connected the antic city with the region.&lt;ref&gt;Kosova Arkelogjike 1&lt;/ref&gt; The attention was given to the findings of the objects in the north entrance of the city. With the addition of the use of air photography and satellites in the past years archaeologists, with no costly digging, were able to find and describe lots of big antique buildings which included a public bathroom, the forum (administrative center of the city), a residency of the bishop in the era of the early Christianity, and a baptismal chapel.&lt;ref name="Justiniana"&gt;[http://www.mkrs-ks.org/repository/docs/drafti_i_guides_-anglisht_final.pdf Archaeological Guide of Kosovo ] Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport, Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, Pristina 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument dedicated to the [[Dardanian Kingdom|Dardanian]] Empress is a site with notable architectural features from this era.&lt;ref name="Kosova - Vështrim Monografik"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kosova - Vështrim Monografik|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave dhe e Arteve e Kosovës|location=Prishtinë|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==

Buildings from the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]], when Kosovo was under the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire]] include castles in [[Prizren]], Veletin and Kasterc and Christian basilicas in [[Ulpiana]], Vërmicë and Harilaq. These and other building signify cultural and spiritual developments in this area. In the Middle Ages, there was a simultaneous presence of Byzantine, Catholic and Orthodox Monuments.&lt;ref name="Kosova - Vështrim Monografik"/&gt;

===Serbian period===

====Monastery in Deçan====

[[File:Dečani3.jpg|thumb|Monastery in Deçan]]
The Church of the monastery was built by a Franciscan Friar from Kotor called Vita (Vitus). The building is of the Romanesque and Gothic architectural styles. The style it was built in is influenced by Western tradition while the main dome of the church links it with Byzantine traditions.
The external part of the church contains details made of marble of different colors decorated with sculpture, while the interior part contains Byzantine frescoes. Most of the original marble furniture is still in the church which is uncommon for churches of this period from the Balkans.
The church was founded by the Serbian king Serbian King Stefan Uroš III Deçanski (1321–31) and it was constructed as his mausoleum.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt;

===Ottoman period===

====Jashar Pasha Mosque====
[[File:Jashar Pasha mosque.jpg|left|thumb|Jashar Pasha mosque]]

The fortress has seen a number of civilizations and constructions in the castle have happened in different historical periods. The remains of the fortress are of point of interest from an architectural point of view. Although it is an important historical monument, archaeological excavations haven't been completed.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Modern===

====Communist period====

In 1950, the early days of the communist regime in Kosovo, which was then part of Yugoslavia, the motto of the state as far as city planning was concerned was "Destroy the old, build the new".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Ta shkatërrojmë të vjetrën, ta ndërtojmë të renë|date = 2006-05-22|newspaper = Gazeta Express|location = Prishtinë}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1959 book by the Municipal National Council of Prishtina called "Prishtina" shows the intentions of the regime at the time to lose the city's previous characteristics in the quest to give it more modern traits. The book boasts about 2200 newly built apartments, a number of health facilities, administrative buildings and schools, 130.000 square meters of new roads and pavements. According to this book, the new look of Prishtina was to be built on the ruins of the old city. New memorials were being erected and special care was being given to set new aesthetic foundations on the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prishtinë|last = |first = |publisher = National Council of the Municipalitz of Prishtina|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Prishtina|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hotel Union building is located in the center of Pristina. It is a three storey, L-shaped building of Austro-Hungarian architectural style with a surface of 500&amp;nbsp;square meters on the ground.
It was designed by an Austrian architect and built in 1927 when it was used as a hotel. Because it is a distinguished example of that particular architectural style in Kosovo it was declared a protected cultural monument 1996.On August 22, 2009 the building caught on fire and sustained major damages.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullaademi|first=Leart|title=Union Hotel in Prishtina on fire|url=http://onupmagazine.com/2009/08/union-hotel-in-prishtina-on-firevideo/|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=ONUP Magazine|date=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building and the surrounding area went through a restoration Arassociati studio that made it functional again. Now it is operated by The United Colors of Benetton and is called Benetton Megastore in Pristina. The store was opened on September 9, 2013. The roof has remained its original form while the entrance has been given a new urban layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Colors of Benetton megastore in Pristina opens.

====Christ the Saviour Cathedral====

[[File:Christ the Saviour Cathedral Pristina February 2013.jpg|thumb|Christ the Saviour Cathedral Pristina February 2013]]
Construction of the Cathedral began 1995 and although it was meant to be finished in 1999, construction was halted by the Kosovo War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christ the Saviour Cathedral |url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/kosovo/pristina/sightseeing/yugoslav-pristina/Christ-the-Saviour-Cathedral_29493v |publisher=inyourpocket |accessdate=2 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302192101/http://www.inyourpocket.com/kosovo/pristina/sightseeing/yugoslav-pristina/Christ-the-Saviour-Cathedral_29493v |archivedate=2 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different groupings that either support the demolition, the completion or the conversion of the building to a museum.
Some Albanians support its demolition or conversion, the reason being that it was built for political and not religious reasons but there are others that support its completion. According to Albanian Architect Eduard Morina who supports demolishing the Cathedral or repurposing it, the Cathedral "... doesn’t have any architectural values and is not among [listed] cultural heritage objects since it is not an old building" he continues.

Archimandrite Sava Janjic, of the Visoki Decani monastery, on the other hand, strongly support making it functional.
According to him, the Cathedral is of architectural significance and "... it is a very interesting mixture of traditional and modern architecture, that shows that one must respect tradition, but also look into the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo Mulls Fate of Milosevic-era Cathedral|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-mulls-fate-of-milosevic-era-cathedral|publisher=Balkan Insight|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war in Kosovo, the Cathedral was bombed and structural damage was caused to it
In the aftermath of the war the church was bombed by unknown attackers and put under the protection of NATO peacekeepers for some years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Head of UN in Kosovo condemns attack on Serb cathedral in Pristina, appeals for end to violence|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/serbia/head-un-kosovo-condemns-attack-serb-cathedral-pristina-appeals-end-violence|publisher=reliefweb|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mother Teresa Cathedral IV.jpg|thumb|Mother Teresa Cathedral IV]]

====Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa in Pristina====

The initiators of the project for building the [[Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa in Pristina|Roman Catholic Cathedral in Pristina]] are [[Ibrahim Rugova]] and Mark Sopi, who set the cornerstone for the building on June 26, 2005. Construction began on September 5, 2007 and it was formally opened by president [[Fatmir Sejdiu]] on September 5, 2000.&lt;ref name="Kosovo News Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inaugurohet Katedralja "Nëna Terezë" në Prishtinë|url=http://knninfo.com/?page=1,9,9845|publisher=Kosovo News Network|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo's New Cathedral Stirs Muslim Resentment|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albanians-vie-for-religious-sites|publisher=BalkanInsight|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vernacular Architecture==

===Kulla===
{{Cleanup gallery|date=November 2018}}
The type of building called ''Kulla'' is a fortified residential building built in Kosovo, mainly in the [[Dukagjini Plateau|Dukagjini]] region. The Albanian word ''kulla'' means "tower" in English. This is a type of building that was initially built from wood and stone and eventually only from stone. This type of building is typical for the Kosovan School of National Albanian Building and they have been built exclusively by the Albanian population in Kosovo. They are also the only buildings in Kosovo that haven't been influenced by foreign styles.

Kullas are heavily fortified buildings with small windows and shooting holes, because their main purpose was to offer security in a fighting situation. The first kullas that were built are from the 17th century, a time when there was continuous fighting in the Dukagjini region, although most of the ones that still remain are from the 18th or 19th century. They are almost always built within a complex of buildings with various functions but kullas in towns exist mostly as standalone structures. They are also positioned within the complex of buildings that they exist in a way that makes it possible for the inhabitants to survey the surrounding area. Kullas in towns are usually built as standalone structures, while in villages they are more commonly found as a part of a larger ensemble of kullas and stone houses, usually grouped based on the family clan they belonged to.

Most kullas are three-storey buildings. A characteristic unit of its architectural structure in "Oda e burrave" (Chamber of Men or Gathering Room of Men) which was usually placed in the second floor of the Kulla, called Divanhane, while the ground floor served as a barn for cattle and the first floor was where the family quarters were located. The material from which the Divanhane is constructed, either wood or stone, is sometimes used to classify Kullas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kulla of Mazrekaj family in Dranoc|date = |last = Limani|first = Jeta|url = http://www.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2007/Kosova___Jeta_Limani_-_Kulla_of_Mazrekaj_Family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arkitektura Vernakulare në Kosovë|last = Doli|first = Flamur|publisher = Association for the Preservation of Architectonic Heritage - SHRTA|year = 2009|isbn = 9789951878609|location = Prishtinë|pages = 93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pejë===

[[File:Peja.jpg|thumb|230px|Main square of the city of [[Peć|Peja]]]]
The '''Architecture of Pejë''', [[Kosovo]], describes a large mixture of architectural structures which are a reflection of the influential foreign rule all across the city. The architecture of the city consists of buildings, structures and constructions which were built with an architectural influence of the [[Byzantine architecture]], [[Serbo-Byzantine architecture]], [[Ottoman architecture]], [[Stalinist architecture]] (former Yugoslavia), and Modern cultures/architectures. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences. The foreign rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] empires and the historical influence of former [[Yugoslavia]] (communist era) have shaped the architectural landscape of the city to become a conglomerate of cultures.

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Image:The cristal baschet.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Cristal Baschet]]]]

The '''Baschet Brothers''' were two French artists named '''François Baschet''' (born 30 March 1920, in Paris; died 11 February 2014) and '''Bernard Baschet''' (born 24 August 1917, Paris; died 17 July 2015&lt;ref name=LeParisien /&gt;) who collaborated on creating [[sound sculpture]]s and inventing [[musical instrument]]s, such as the ''[[Cristal Baschet]]''. François Baschet was a sculptor and Bernard Baschet an engineer. The Baschet Brothers invented the [[inflatable guitar]], the aluminum piano and many other [[experimental musical instrument]]s. They created an "Baschet Educational Instrumentarium" for exposing young people to musical concepts. 
[[File:Cristal Baschet basse.png|thumb|Baschet bass cristal]] The Baschet's research started in the 1950s artistic turmoil, soon turning the two brothers into the pioneers of sound sculpture, in addition to making them highly requested by musicians, composers, experimental directors.

The quest for new sounds led the Baschet brothers to combine new materials of the time, usually through folding metal sheets into geometric shapes.
Their sculptures range from small folded sheet metal of a few centimeters up to structures several meters high with loud, impressive and complex sounds.
Their exhibitions were shown in prestigious museums throughout the world – the United States, Japan, Germany – as well as in small villages in France, always with the aim of making art accessible to all.

The work of the Baschet brothers of making sound art accessible to all continues through the official association, established in 1982: the Baschet Sound Structures Association (originally "Structures sonores et pédagogie", it changed its name in 2012). The association has the support of the Baschet family and has an exclusive licence for creating some of the Baschet reproductible works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baschet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Instruments

The [[Cristal baschet]] is a type of musical instrument designed by the Baschet brothers in the 1950s, the Cristal Baschet is played with wet fingers on glass rods.
Its continuous, enchanting sounds have inspired many artists and composers.
The current Cristal Baschet models produce a variety of sounds and can also be used in percussion. They can be fitted with numerous resonators including "moustaches" and different types of diffusers: cones and metal sheets.

The Rotating Whistler (“Le Sifflant Tournant”, created in 1962, produces the sharpest and longest sounds of all the Baschet Sound Structures. Turning the keyboard produces an unusual sound effect which does not need an amplifier cone.

Created in 1967, the Polytonal Percussion (“La Percussion Polytimbre”) includes large, straight rods that create deep, resonant sounds. The keyboard is organized with different percussive devices and cones diffuse the sound.

The Voice Leaf (“La Tôle à Voix”) was created in 1965 to mimic the Indian tempura, the metal sheets serve as resonators which transform the human voice when vibrated.

Public monuments

The Baschet brothers also created several public monuments such as clocks, fountains, bell towers and chimes – some ephemeral, some still in existence.
One of the first fountains created was made for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130223043245/http://www.worldsfair68.info/ World's Fair], in San Antonio Texas in 1968.

They made others in the early 1970s, including in Cologne, New York, Mexico City, London and Barcelona.

Subsequently, they worked on bell towers and clocks. The Baschet "signal sonore"(or school bell) of the Blaise Pascal school is in the process of being restored in Saint-Michel-sur-Orge – the town where Bernard Baschet's studio has been since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/saint-michel-sur-orge-91240/saint-michel-la-legendaire-sculpture-sonore-va-de-nouveau-resonner-a-l-ecole-19-04-2017-6867987.php] Article in Le Parisien newspaper. Retrieved 20 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baschet Educational Instrumentarium

Invented in the 1980s, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium consists of 14 sound structures which make a "sound palette" of around 100 different tones.
Its purpose is to initiate children, adults and people with disabilities in collective musical discovery through games and experimentation, and without any previous musical knowledge.

Based on the large, original Baschet sound structures, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium creates a broad spectrum of sounds, including those not in the classical European repertoire, as well as some which resemble electroacoustic sounds.

Education in sound culture is stimulated through listening to sounds, to oneself and to others. The experience of sound is not only through listening, it is also through hands-on learning and musical improvisation.

This Instrumentarium is also used in concert by musicians. There are approximately 500 Baschet Educational Instrumentariums in existence, in France and around the world.

==Career==
François had wanted to be an artist, but his father warned him against pursuing the unstable life of an artist. He decided to study business in college, but felt no passion for it. After [[World War II]], which had interrupted his education, he decided to travel around the world. He brought with him on his trip a guitar to help him earn a living, but wanting something more portable he invented an inflatable guitar using a [[balloon]] and a collapsible wood neck. He continued to perform with this guitar upon his return to Paris. Soon he and his brother, who had studied engineering, began collaborating on sculptural musical instruments.

Beginning in 1952, the Baschets started research into all existing musical instruments and put this knowledge to work in creating dozens of ''structures sonores'' (i.e., 'sonorous sculptures'). Their visually striking instruments were crafted out of steel and aluminum and [[amplifier|amplified]] by large curved conical sheets of metal, and are most often easy to play and accessible to people with any level of experience. One example of this is the [[Hemisfair Musical Fountain]], which consists of an array of posts at the top of which are groups of conical sound diffusers, and above them circles of metal prongs. These are played by jets of water aimed by observers.

In 1954, the brothers met Jacques and Yvonne Lasry. Jacques was a pianist and composer and Yvonne was an organist. The four formed an association which they called "Lasry-Baschet Sound Structures." They held their first concerts in 1955. The group was successful and in 1960 were asked by [[Jean Cocteau]] to provide music for his film, ''[[Testament of Orpheus|Le Testament d'Orphée]]''. The group toured, appearing on television shows including [[The Ed Sullivan Show]]. In 1966 they were invited to hold an exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and director [[Alfred Barr]] purchased a sculpture for the museum's collection. Their tune Manège was also used as theme for the Granada TV program Picture Box, which ran in the United Kingdom from 1966 to 1990.

In the 1960s the Lasrys emigrated to [[Israel]]. In 1977 Bernard met Michel Deneuve, a musician, who joined them, starting a new association, and assisted in creating instruments. Deneuve was especially dedicated to working on their instrument called the "Cristal".&lt;ref&gt;♙♙[http://francois.baschet.free.fr/story.htm Baschet website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10029">'''Community arts''', also sometimes known as "dialogical art", "community-engaged" or "community-based art," refers to artistic activity based in a [[community]] setting. Works from this genre can be of any media and is characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community. Often professional artists collaborate with people who may not otherwise normally actively engage in the arts. The term was defined in the late-1960s and spawned a movement which grew in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Scandinavia]], the term "community art" means more often contemporary art project.

Often community art is based in economically deprived areas, with a community-oriented, grassroots approach. Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process, sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors. These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level.

In English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community [[arts centre]]. [[Visual arts]] ([[fine art]], video, [[new media art]]), music, and theater are common mediums in community art centers. Many arts companies in the UK do some community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.

== Community art and public art ==
The term "community art" refers also to the field of community, neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods. In the art world, community art signifies a particular art making practice, emphasizing community involvement and collaboration. Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork/s with artists. This is a growing national, international, regional and local field. Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface, including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level.

== Forms of Collaborative Practices ==
Models of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group in order to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or [[Social Circus|social circus]]) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icasc.ca/what-art-social-change|title=What is Art for Social Change? {{!}} Art for Social Change|website=icasc.ca|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change.

Due to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melucci|first=Alberto|last2=Avritzer|first2=Leonardo|date=2000-12-01|title=Complexity, cultural pluralism and democracy: collective action in the public space|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/39/4/507|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1177/053901800039004001|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue.

In Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non-arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf http://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns.

As the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-016-9257-7?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst] As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of [[Arts in education|arts education]].

== Online community art ==
A [[community]] can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also [[virtual communities]] or online communities.  [[Internet art]] has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project.

==Community theatre==
[[Community theatre]] includes theatre made by, with, and for a community—it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often [[devised theatre|devised]] and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as [[carnival]], [[circus]], and [[parade]]s, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the [[social capital]] of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.

[[File:Deformity of Hand due to X-ray burns.jpg|thumb|Female hand showing deformity due to x-ray burns. The inflammation is due to excessive radiation, which occurs when x-ray machines are unshielded.]]

A '''deformity''', '''dysmorphism''', or '''dysmorphic feature''' is a major abnormality in the shape of a body part or organ compared to the normal shape of that part.
==Causes==
Deformity may arise from numerous causes:
*Genetic [[mutation]]
*Damage to the [[fetus]] or [[uterus]]
*Complications at [[childbirth|birth]]
*A growth or hormone disorder
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury, e.g. [[Third degree burn|burn injury]]
*[[Arthritis]] and other rheumatoid disorders
*Fractured bones left to heal without being properly [[Reduction (orthopedic_surgery)|set]] ([[malunion]])
*Chronic application of external forces, e.g. [[artificial cranial deformation]]
*Chronic [[paresis]], [[paralysis]] or [[muscle imbalance]], especially in children, e.g. due to [[poliomyelitis]] or [[cerebral palsy]]

Deformity can occur in non-humans, as well.  [[Frogs]] can be mutated due to [[Ribeiroia]] ([[Trematoda]]) infection.

==Mortality==
In many cases in which a major deformity is present at birth, it is the result of an underlying condition severe enough that the baby does not survive very long. The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs, structural defects that prevent breathing or eating, and high susceptibility to injuries, abnormal facial appearance, or infections that lead to death.

==In mythology==
[[Mythological]] creatures may have been created due to a deformative syndrome also, for instance, descriptions of [[mermaid]]s may be related to the symptoms of [[sirenomelia]]. The [[Irish Mythology]] includes the [[Fomorians]], who are almost without exception described as being deformed, possessing only one of what most have two of ([[human eye|eye]]s, [[arm]]s, [[Human leg|leg]]s, etc.) or having larger than normal limbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2093">A '''design classic''' is an industrially manufactured object with timeless aesthetic value. It serves as a standard of its kind and remains up to date regardless of the year of its design.
Whether a particular object is a [[design]] [[classic]] might often be debatable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Emily|title=Design Classics: unequivocal, tangible, iconic?|url=http://designandsociety.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/design-classics-unequivocal-tangible-iconic/|accessdate=22 September 2011|date=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the term is sometimes abused&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a design classic?|last=Bayley|first=Stephen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/what-makes-a-design-classic-1115520.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 September 2011|date=27 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but there exists a body of acknowledged classics of [[product design]]s from the 19th and 20th century.

For an object to become a design classic requires time,&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; and whatever lasting impact the design has had on society, together with its influence on later designs, play large roles in determining whether something becomes a design classic. Thus, design classics are often strikingly simple, going to the essence, and are described with words like ''iconic'', ''neat'', ''valuable'' or ''having meaning''.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; for example a vacuum cleaner is often known as a hoover, which was not the vacuum cleaner's name  but instead was the surname of its inventor, William Henry Hoover.

'''Frederic Will''' is a Midwestern American writer.  Will has been active in many genres: poetry, fiction, [[cultural history]], philosophy, translation, travel memoir.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
The American poet/novelist/critic/translator Frederic Will was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1928. His parents, Samuel and Constance, moved the family to the [[Midwest]] in 1930; Will's father was for the next 25 years a professor of French at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[Indiana University]]. His mother was a bilingual (English/French) housewife. The house in which he was brought up was lined with bookshelves of French literary classics—Montaigne and Rabelais featured, in leather bindings cut for them on the Left Bank. Will was raised on the campus of the University of Illinois, where—except during two years of [[asthma]] recovery in [[Arizona]]—he remained until going to [[Phillips Andover]] for his senior year of high school. His subsequent education was at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1946), Laval University in Quebec, and at Indiana University (B.A. in Classics, 1949), and [[Yale University]] (PhD Comparative Literature, 1954). Laval, with its pre-modern Thomist atmosphere, was the deepest of these forays into learning from others.

===Personal life===
Will is married, has six children, and lives both in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]] and in [[Delta State]], Nigeria. He has traveled widely, both in Asia and Africa, and has only two more locations on his must-visit list: Russia and Zaire. Writing and traveling seem to him activities that call on one another, as though the appetite of the world to be named accompanied the writing instrument of the seeing traveler.

===Career===
Will has taught Comparative Literature, Classics, and Translation Workshops at various Universities in the United States and abroad: [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] (1951–54), [[Penn State]] (1955–60), [[University of Texas]] (1960–65), [[University of Iowa]] (1965–70, 1983–85), [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967), [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1970–83), [[University of Colorado]] (1978), [[Deep Springs College]] (2004–06), Instituto de Estudios Criticos (2007). He was Co-Director of the University of Iowa International Writing Program (1983-1985). He was Overseer and President of [[Mellen University]] (1990–1999). Abroad he has taught at the Universities of Tuebingen, Tunis, Ivory Coast, Chad, Mizoram (India), Chang'sha China (Hunan Normal). He currently teaches for the Humanities University (humanitiesuniversity.org or humanitiesinstitute.org) where he is Vice President for Research.

===Editorial work===
Founding editor (with [[William Arrowsmith]]) of ''Arion, A Journal of Classical Culture'' (1962--) University of Texas. Founder and editor of ''Micromegas, A Journal of Poetry in Translation'' (1965–75). Arion marked a turning point in Anglo-American classical studies, replacing positivist 'contribution studies' by more imaginative and daring efforts to open the classical tradition into its blazing richness. Micromegas, like Robert Bly's ''The Sixties'', was a single-handed effort to enrich American poetry with the bloodstreams of at first contemporary Latin-American poetry, and then, in subsequent issues, of a wide variety of national issues—French, German, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic.

===Archival material===
Will's literary and editorial papers (1962–) are in the Humanities Research Center, University of Texas.The collection includes hundreds of pages of manuscripts of both published and unpublished materials, in addition to an extensive correspondence dating back to the University of Texas Renaissance, under HRC Director, Harry Ransom.

'''Gurumāpā''' ([[Devanagari]]: गुरुमापा) is a mythical creature in the folklore of [[Nepal Mandala]]. According to legend, he is said to take away disobedient children, and so was banished to a field in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;Slusser, Mary Shepherd (1982). ''Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley.'' Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691031282}}, 9780691031286. Page 364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, Hugh; Everist, Richard and Wheeler, Tony (1999). ''Nepal: Lonely Planet Travel Guides.'' Lonely Planet. {{ISBN|0864427042}}, 9780864427045. Page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Gurumapa is one of the most well known [[Folklore|folk tale]]s in [[Newar]] society. He is depicted as a giant with a terrifying face and protruding fangs.

==The legend==

===Kesh Chandra ===

The story starts with an inveterate named Kesh Chandra who lived in Itumbaha, a sacred courtyard in central Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Pratapaditya and National Centre for the Performing Arts (India) (2004). ''Nepal, old images, new insights.'' Marg Publications. {{ISBN|8185026688}}, 9788185026688. Page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/kathmandu/sights/square-plaza/itum-bahal| title = Lonely Planet review for Itum Bahal| work = | publisher = Lonely Planet| year=2012| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he had gambled away all of his property, he went to live with his sister. When he stole even the plate on which his lunch was served to gamble, his sister, wishing to teach him a lesson, served his rice on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Jim (1981). ''Guide to enjoying Nepalese festivals: an introductory survey of religious celebration in Kathmandu Valley.'' Kali Press. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply hurt, Kesh Chandra gathered up the food in a handkerchief and walked a long distance to the woods outside the city. Feeling hungry, he unwrapped the rice, and found that it had turned bad and there were maggots all over. So he spread the food to dry in the sun and dozed off.

===Droppings turn to gold===

When Kesh Chandra awoke, he found that pigeons had eaten everything. He was so saddened that he broke into tears. Taking pity on him, the pigeons left their droppings which turned into gold. There was so much gold that he couldn't carry it all. As he was pondering what to do, he saw Gurumapa, a man-eating giant that lived in the forest, approaching. He had been attracted by the smell of prey.

Kesh Chandran pacified him by calling him uncle, and persuaded him to carry the gold to his home with the promise of a feast and the right to take away children if their parents called him whenever they were bad. Kesh Chandra took Gurumapa home to Itumbaha and let him live in the attic. As the years passed, children started disappearing whenever their parents warned them that Gurumapa would come and get them.

===Banished to Tundikhel===
The local residents then decided that it was not safe to keep Gurumapa in the neighborhood. They promised to provide him an annual feast of boiled rice and buffalo meat if he agreed to live on the field of Tinkhya ([[Tundikhel]]). And so the giant was persuaded to move out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title= Polishing up the past|url= http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/2005/07/22/Arts/604|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper= Nepali Times|date= 22–28 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the people of the locality prepare a feast on the day of Ghode Jatra for Gurumapa and leave it on the field which is now a parade ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Child| first = John| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://newsblaze.com/story/20110315112122chil.nb/topstory.html| title = Colors and Rituals Mark Holi in Nepal| work = | publisher = News Blaze| date=15 March 2011| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bisht|first=Kapil|title=A walk into the heritage|url=http://ecs.com.np/features/a-walk-into-the-heritage|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=ECS Nepal|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy Ben Ner''' (born in 1969) is an [[Israel]]i [[video artist]]. He lives and works in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Berlin]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=43591 Guy Ben-Ner] [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017185219/http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=43591 |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography ==
Guy Ben-Ner received a Bachelor of Arts in Education in 1997 from [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|Hamidrasha School of Art]], [[Ramat Hasharon]] and a [[Master of Fine Arts]] from [[Columbia University]] in New York City in 2003. At Columbia, he studied under the critic [[Jerry Saltz]].&lt;ref name=JS/&gt;

==Art career==
Since the early 1990s, Ben Ner has filmed a series of short [[Video art|videos]] starring himself and his family, often using the intimate spaces of their home as ''ad hoc'' set, studio, and fantastical playroom.&lt;ref name=uchicago&gt;[http://adaptation.uchicago.edu/artists/ben-ner/work/ Guy Ben-Ner]. Adaptation, January 31 – May 4, 2008 Smart Museum of Art, [[University of Chicago]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612202158/http://adaptation.uchicago.edu/artists/ben-ner/work/ |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His works are often exhibited with the simple sets and props created for the videos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=450 Guy Ben-Ner: Thursday the 12th, May 23, 2009 – April 25, 2019] [[MASS MoCA]] in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in Ben-Ner’s early videos is the tedium and isolation experienced by a stay-at-home parent. Ben-Ner’s first narrative video, ''Berkeley’s Island'' (1999), based on [[Daniel Defoe]]’s ''Robinson Crusoe'' (1719), depicts the solitary life of a castaway. Set in the family kitchen, it opens with a scene of the artist lying on his back in a bathing suit on a meter-wide pile of sand from which a lone palm tree grows, with a steering wheel across his bare, sunburned chest. The 15-minute video features several vignettes about life on the island, which Ben-Ner narrates in a voice-over. The plot does not follow Defoe’s exactly, though notable moments in the book are re-created, such as the castaway discovering a footprint and training a parrot (played by the family cat) to say his name. The castaway has delusions; he sees himself levitating and losing a limb—simplistic magic tricks that Ben-Ner stages using mirrors. To depict a raging gale, Ben-Ner rigs the palm tree with ropes that are pulled by someone offscreen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/66/SolitaryRefinementGuyBenNer|title=ArtAsiaPacific: Solitary Refinement Guy Ben Ner|website=artasiapacific.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wild Boy'' (2004), an adaptation of [[François Truffaut]]'s 1970 film ''[[The Wild Child|L'enfant sauvage (The Wild Child)]]'', can be shown in two forms: alone, or incorporated into an [[installation art|installation]] that re-creates a woodland set that the artist built in his kitchen, complete with a tree and a carpeted hill on which visitors may sit to watch the video.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; In ''Stealing Beauty'' (2007), the artist's family staged guerrilla theater in [[IKEA]] showrooms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Karen Rosenberg |date=November 13, 2009 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED9123FF930A25752C1A96F9C8B63&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=guy%20ben-ner&amp;st=cse |title=Art in Review: Guy Ben-Ner |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving among the displays, they conduct a reasonable facsimile of family life; dishes are done, discipline imposed, discussions held (private property is a topic), and everyone tucks in for the night — in numerous beds — as IKEA's other customers wander through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Roberta Smith |authorlink=Roberta Smith |date=August 2, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/arts/design/idea-is-the-object.html |title='Idea Is the Object' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the art critic [[Blake Gopnik]] spent six hours in the [[P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center]] (now the [[MoMA PS1]]) in New York, taking the measure of 326 works by 162 of “New York’s most promising artists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-artist-guy-ben-ner-s-family-lies-and-videotape-1.5236810|title=Family, Lies and Videotape: Guy Ben-Ner's Meteoric Rise to Fame|last=Karpel|first=Dalia|date=2013-04-04|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Foreign Names'' (2012), Ben Ner visited nearly 100 [[Aroma Espresso Bar]] locations, left a fake name in English that would be called out at the counter when his beverage was ready, then edited all the videotaped segments to create an "ode" lamenting the disappearance of waiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postmastersart.com/archive/benner14/benner14direct.html |title=Guy Ben Ner: Soundtrack, January 25 - March 8, 2014 |publisher=Postmasters |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Soundtrack'' (2013) takes an eleven-minute scene from [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2005 movie ''[[War of the Worlds]]'' as a "ready-made" soundtrack and pairs it with footage shot in Ben Ner's kitchen in Tel Aviv, with smashing plates and combusting appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Martha Schwendener |date=January 30, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/arts/design/guy-ben-ner-soundtrack.html |title=Guy Ben Ner: 'Soundtrack' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hospital at Arles''''' is the subject of two paintings that [[Vincent van Gogh]] made of the hospital in which he stayed in December 1888 and again in January 1889. The hospital is located in [[Arles]] in [[southern France]]. One of the paintings is of the central garden between four buildings titled ''Garden of the Hospital in Arles'' (also known as the ''Courtyard of the Hospital at Arles''); the other painting is of a ward within the hospital titled ''Ward of the Hospital in Arles''. Van Gogh also painted a ''Portrait of Dr. Félix Rey'' his physician while in the hospital.

==Arles==

[[Arles]] is located in a region called [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], department of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] in [[southern France]].  It is about {{convert|32|km}} southeast of Nîmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-guide.com/arles_guide/where_is_arles_in_france |title=Where is Arles? |year=2011 |work=Arles Guide |publisher=Arles-guide.com |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

Arles became a successful port for trade in France during the Roman period.  Many immigrants from [[North Africa]] came to Arles in the 17th and 18th centuries; their influence is reflected in many of the houses of the town that were built during that period.&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-guide.com/arles_guide/arles_history |title=Arles History |year=2011 |work=Arles Guide |publisher=Arles-guide.com |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rhône. The arrival of the railway in the 19th century eventually took away of much of the river trade, reducing the city's commercial business.  Because Arles maintained Provençal charm it attracted artists, like Van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.provence-hideaway.com/205.html |title=Arles |year=2011 |work=Provence Hideaways |publisher=Travel Writers Coop |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Gogh===

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - The yellow house ('The street').jpg|thumb|''[[Yellow House (painting)|The Yellow House]]'' (1888) [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam (F464)]]
Van Gogh came to Arles on February 20, 1888 and initially stayed at the lodgings at Restaurant Carrel. Signs of spring were evident in the budding almond trees and of winter by the snow-covered landscape. To Van Gogh the scene seemed like a [[Japanese art|Japanese]] landscape.&lt;ref name=Leeuw353&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Arles was quite a different place than anywhere else he had lived.  The climate was sunny, hot and dry and the local inhabitants had more of an appearance and sound of people from Spain. The "vivid colors and strong compositional outlines" of Provence led van Gogh to call the area "the Japan of the South."&lt;ref name=NGAsun&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |page=121 (starting 1 of pdf) |publisher=National Gallery of Art |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time he produced more than 200 paintings including ''The Starry Night'' [''[[Starry Night over the Rhone]]''], ''[[The Night Café|Café de Nuit]]'' and ''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|The Sunflowers]]''.&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory/&gt;

Van Gogh had few friends in Arles, although through acquaintance with Joseph Roulin, a postman, and Ginoux, the owner of Cafe de la Gare where he next roomed, he made many portraits of the [[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|Roulin family]] and of [[L'Arlésienne (painting)|Madame Ginoux]]. Part of his difficulty in making friends was his inability to master the [[Provençal dialect]], "whole days go by without my speaking a single word to anyone, except to order my meals or coffee." In the beginning of his time in Arles, though, he was so enthused by the setting in  Provence that the lack of connection with others hadn't troubled him.  In October 1888 [[Paul Gauguin]] came to Arles and joined van Gogh in his rented rooms at ''[[Yellow House (painting)|The Yellow House]]''.&lt;ref name=Leeuw385&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 385&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unfortunately many of the places that van Gogh had visited and painted were destroyed during bombing raids in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory/&gt;

===Events leading up to stay at Arles hospital===

Van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in an altercation with [[Paul Gauguin]] in December 1888 following which van Gogh cut off part of his own left ear.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was then hospitalized in Arles twice over a few months. His condition was diagnosed by the hospital as "acute mania with generalised delirium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concordance, lists, bibliography: Documentation|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/documentation.html#id8May1889|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Doctor Rey|Dr. Félix Rey]], a young intern at the hospital, also suggested there might be "a kind of epilepsy" involved that he characterised as ''mental'' epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and Smith (2011), 701 ''ff.'', 729, 749&lt;/ref&gt; Although some, such as [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna van Gogh]], [[Paul Signac]] and posthumous speculation by doctors Doiteau &amp; Leroy have said that van Gogh just removed part of his earlobe and maybe a little more,&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, 106&lt;/ref&gt; art historian Rita Wildegans maintains that without exception, all of the witnesses from Arles said that he removed the entire left ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wildegans.de/vangogh/english/index.html | title=Van Gogh's Ear | author=Wildegans, Dr. R | publisher=Dr. Rita Wildegans | accessdate=2011-04-27 | postscript="''It can be said that with the exception of the sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], who had family-related reasons for playing down the injury, not a single witness speaks of a severed earlobe. On the contrary, the mutually independent statements by the principal witness Paul Gauguin, the prostitute who was given the ear, the gendarme who was on duty in the red-light district, the investigating police officer and the local newspaper report, accord with the evidence that the artist's unfortunate "self-mutilation" involves the entire (left) ear. The existing handwritten and clearly worded medical reports by three different physicians, all of whom observed and treated Vincent van Gogh over an extended period of time in Arles as well as in the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy]] ought to provide ultimate proof of the fact that the artist was missing an entire ear and not just an earlobe.''"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1889, he returned to the Yellow House where he was living, but spent the following month between hospital and home suffering from hallucinations and delusions that he was being poisoned. In March 1889, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople, who called him "fou roux" (''the redheaded madman''). Signac visited him in hospital and van Gogh was allowed home in his company. In April 1889, he moved into rooms owned by Dr. Félix Rey, after floods damaged paintings in his own home.&lt;ref&gt;Pickvance (1986). ''Chronology'', 239–242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tralbaut (1981), 265–273&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he wrote, "Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant." Finally in May 1889 he left Arles for the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul asylum]] in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 145&lt;/ref&gt; having understood his own mental fragility and with a desire to leave Arles.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arles Hospital===
The courtyard of the former Arles hospital, now named "Espace Van Gogh," is a center for van Gogh's works, several of which are masterpieces.&lt;ref name=Fodor&gt;Fisher, 563&lt;/ref&gt; The garden, framed on all four sides by buildings of the complex, is approached through arcades on the first floor.  A circulation gallery is located on the first and second floors.&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

The Old Hospital of Arles, also known as Hôtel-Dieu-Saint-Espirit, was built in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its main entrance was on Rue Dulau in [[Arles]].  In the early 16th century there were thirty-two charitable institutions serving the city.  The archbishop of Arles decided to consolidate the institutions into one organization at the center of Arles.  Construction was conducted over two centuries.  During excavations remains were unearthed from a [[protohistory]] period  [a period between [[prehistory]] and written [[history]] ] revealing an unknown part of the ancient urban framework, as well as a [[necropolis]] from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[esplanade]].&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

In 1835 three wings were built to accommodate a severe [[cholera]] [[epidemic]].  In the beginning of the 20th century the hospital was modified to bring it up to medical standards of the day.  In 1974 the Joseph-Imbert Hospital was opened and many functions of the Old Hospital of Arles transferred to the new hospital.  By 1986 all medical departments had vacated the buildings and the hospital became part of a restoration project to create a cultural and university center.  The center includes "a media library, the public records, the International College of the Literary Translation (C.I.T.L.), the university radio, a vast showroom, as well as a few shops." Architects Denis Froidevaux and Jean-Louis Tétrel, chosen for the project, preserved historic features, such as the Roman [[esplanade]].&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-tourisme.com/en_GB/Ville_visite.aspx?Code=79736750-9df2-47a6-b634-62518b8773b5&amp;Page=1&amp;Ville=Arles |title=Espace Van Gogh |work=Visiter, Places of Interest |publisher=Arles Office de Tourisme |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323102647/http://www.arles-tourisme.com/en_GB/Ville_visite.aspx?Code=79736750-9df2-47a6-b634-62518b8773b5&amp;Page=1&amp;Ville=Arles |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding by benefactors meant the hospital serviced all patient's needs, including abandoned children and orphans.  Starting in 1664 nuns of the [[Augustinians|Order of Saint Augustin]] cared for the patients.&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

==Paintings==
The ''Ward of Arles Hospital'' portrays the institution and the ''Garden of the Hospital in Arles'' the scene outside his hospital room window&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt; or off of a balcony.&lt;ref name=Fell28&gt;Fell, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh was also occasionally able to leave the hospital complex and paint the fields.&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;

===''Garden of the Hospital in Arles''===
Van Gogh made a drawing of the courtyard of the hospital in June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/595.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 17 or 18 June 1889  |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits| accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vantage point for the painting was his room within the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobharris.com/2008/10/ |title=A visit to Van Gogh’s Arles |author=Harris, B |year=2008 |publisher=bob.harris.com |accessdate=2011-04-30 | postscript=" See photo that shows the vantage point that matches exactly to the painting." }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Gogh's description and his painting of the garden allow for identification of its flowers, such as: blue bearded irises, forget-me-nots, oleander, pansies, primroses,  and poppies.  The original design of the courtyard as described by Van Gogh has been preserved.  Radiating segments are surrounded by a "plante bande" now filled with irises.  A difference between the painting and the garden is that van Gogh increased the size of the central fish garden for better composition.&lt;ref name=Fell30&gt;Fell, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Adept at using color to convey mood, the shades of blue and gold in the painting seem to suggest melancholy. The yellow, orange, red and green in the painting are not vivid shades seen in other work from Arles, such as ''Bedroom in Arles.''&lt;ref&gt;Acton, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ward in the Hospital in Arles''===
In October 1889 van Gogh resumed painting of a fever ward titled ''Ward in the Hospital in Arles''.  The large study had been unattended for a while and van Gogh's interest was sparked when he read an article regarding [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s book ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|''Souvenirs de la maison des morts'' ("Memories of the House of the Dead")]].&lt;ref name=LW15&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W15.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh.

Vincent described the painting to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], "In the foreground a big black stove around which some grey and black forms of patients and then behind the very long ward paved in red with the two rows of white beds, the partitions white, but a lilac- or green-white, and the windows with pink curtains, with green curtains, and in the background two figures of nuns in black and white. The ceiling is violet with large beams."&lt;ref name=LW15/&gt;

Debra Mancoff, author of ''Van Gogh's Flowers,''&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff&lt;/ref&gt; comments, "In his painting, Ward of Arles Hospital, the exaggerated length of the corridor and the nervous contours that delineate the figures of the patients express the emotional weight of his isolation and confinement."&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/vincent-van-gogh-paintings-from-saint-remy5.htm |title=Ward of Arles Hospital by Vincent van Gogh |author=Mancoff, D |year=2006–2011 |work=HowStuffWorks |publisher=Publications International, Ltd. |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Portrait of Dr. Félix Rey''==
Van Gogh made a portrait of the physician who had treated his ear, Dr. Félix Rey, whom he had described in letters to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], as “brave, hardworking, and always helping people.” By January 17, 1889 Van Gogh had given the portrait to Rey as a keepsake.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gogh; Suh, 242&lt;/ref&gt; Rey's mother reportedly deemed the portrait “hideous” and used to close a hole in the family's chicken coop. In 1901, an art dealer, possibly Lucien Molinard– who had received six Van Goghs to sell from Rey in 1900 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feilchenfeldt |first1=Walter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfziAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA306|title=Vincent Van Gogh: The Years in France: Complete Paintings 1886-1890 |date=2013 |page=306 |publisher=Philip Wilson |isbn=1781300194 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; –acquired three paintings from Dr. Rey, including the portrait which was in the possession of [[Ambroise Vollard]] by 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khoshbin |first1=Shahram ||last2=Katz |first2=J.T. |title=“Van Gogh’s Physician” |journal=Infectious Diseases Society of America - Open Forum Infectious Diseases, Volume 2, Issue 3, 1 September 2015, ofv088, |date=September 15, 2015 |volume=2 |issue=3 |doi=10.1093/ofid/ofv088 |url=https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/2/3/ofv088/2460268 |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the portrait was installed at the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], with an estimated value of over $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vangoghstudio.com/portrait-of-doctor-felix-rey/|title=Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey Oil Painting Reproduction, 1889|website=van gogh studio|language=nl-NL|access-date=22 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023061312/http://www.vangoghstudio.com/portrait-of-doctor-felix-rey/|archivedate=23 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawings==
[[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] wrote of  a drawing he received, "The hospital at Arles is outstanding, the butterfly and branches of [[Rosa rubiginosa|eglantine]] are very beautiful too: simple in colour and very beautifully drawn."&lt;ref&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 447&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyewon pungsokdo''' is an album of the [[genre paintings]] (''pungsokhwa'' or ''pungsokdo'') drawn by the Korean painter [[Shin Yunbok]] during the late [[Joseon dynasty]]. It was named after Shin's [[pen name]], '''Hyewon''', and comprises 30 paintings in total.

In 1930, [[Jeon Hyeopil]] (전형필:全鎣弼), later the founder of the [[Gansong Art Museum]], purchased it from an antique dealer in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]] and newly mounted the album. [[Oh Sechang]] (오세창), who was a journalist and pro-independence activist, wrote the subtitles and postface for the album. ''Hyewon pungsokdo'' is designated as the 135th [[National treasures of South Korea|National Treasure of South Korea]] and is held in the collection of the [[Gansong Art Museum]] located in [[Seongbuk-gu]], [[Seoul]], South Korea.&lt;!--Is it on display there or kept in a vault?--&gt;

'''''Inpress''''' was a free weekly [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized music magazine ([[street press]]) that was published in [[Melbourne]],&lt;ref name=sbel&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Bella|title=Drum Media, Inpress and Time Off to be Rebranded|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/drum-media-inpress-time-off-to-be-rebranded/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Music Feeds|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appd&gt;{{cite web|title=Inpress magazine|url=http://www.appdata.com/uapps/ios/2580401-inpress-magazine|work=AppData|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released in the [[Geelong]] and [[Mornington Peninsula]] areas of [[Victoria, Australia]]. The magazine was published by [[Street Press Australia]]&lt;ref name=appd/&gt; on a weekly basis every Wednesday.

The magazine comprised three main sections: All music news, features and reviews fall under the ''Inpress'' banner, arts and film is covered by ''Interval'', and the central section is [[dance music]]/[[urban music]] and [[Nightclub|nightclubbing]] magazine ''Zebra'', which is also distributed separately from ''Inpress''. The editors of the paper were Andrew Mast (Managing Editor), Shane O'Donohue (Editor), Kris Swales (''Zebra'' Editor) and Daniel Crichton-Rouse (''Interval'' Editor). [[Myf Warhurst]] is a former editor.

''Inpress'' also frequently published 'special features', such as their yearly [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] guide. 

''Inpress'' contained many popular features, including local cartoonist and musician [[Fred Negro]]'s  weekly cult comic strip, ''Pub''. Other notable features within ''Inpress'' included ''Finish Line'' (industry news column), Sugarfoot's ''SoDa Pop'' (pop gossip/news column - a differently named version of which had previously appeared in ''Beat Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beat|url=http://www.beat.com.au/|work=Beat|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until early 2004; [[Jeff Jenkins]]' ''Howzat!'' (indie rock and pop news), [[Clem Bastow]]'s ''Singled Out'' (singles reviews column) and [[Anthony Carew]]'s (some would say) notorious film reviews column in ''Interval'', ''Film Carew''. 

in 2006, Interests associated with ''Inpress'' publishers Craig and Leigh Treweek bought the influential [[Sydney]] street press ''[[Drum Media]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monika Lackmann|title=Sydney’s Drum Media Bought By Melbourne’s Inpress Magazine|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/aust/3967/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Faster Louder|date=8 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Treweek said at the time that "This is a great opportunity to build a strong music media outlet that is supportive of the local music scene at a grass roots level."

In August 2013 ''Inpress'' and other two magazines of the company, ''Drum Media'' and ''[[Time Off]]'', were merged under a new title, ''The Music''.&lt;ref name=sbel/&gt;

'''Jean Moréas''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔreas|lang}}; born '''Ioannis A. Papadiamantopoulos''', Ιωάννης Α. Παπαδιαμαντόπουλος; 15 April 1856 – 31 March 1910&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Moréas|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|date=14 August 2007|accessdate=30 November 2016|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Moreas}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[Greeks|Greek]] poet, essayist, and [[art critic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|1967|p=176}}; {{harvnb|Rees|1992|p=388}}; {{harvnb|Shipley|1972|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote mostly in the [[French language]] but also in [[Modern Greek|Greek]] during his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Τρυγόνες καί Έχιδνες – Vipers and Turtledoves (1873).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Moréas was born into a distinguished [[Athens|Athenian]] family on April 15, 1856.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; His ancestors included two well-known men of the [[Greek War of Independence]], namely his paternal grandfather and namesake [[Ioannis Papadiamantopoulos (elder)|Ioannis Papadiamantopoulos]] (1766–1826), born in [[Corinth]] but of ultimately [[Epirus|Epirote]] ancestry&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jouanny|1975|loc=Chapter II: "Histoire d' une Famille", pp. 51–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (he was executed after the fall of [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|Missolonghi]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finlay|1861|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his maternal granduncle [[Iakovos Tombazis]] (c. 1782–1829),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jouanny|1975|loc=Chapter II: "Histoire d'une Famille", p. 60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], who became one of the first admirals of the Greek navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raynaud|1929|loc="Jean Moreas: L' Homme: sa vie intime", pp. 11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreas's father was Adamantios Papadiamantopoulos, a judge, scholar, and poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adamson|2007|p=70}}; {{harvnb|Rees|1992|p=388}}; {{harvnb|Tiryakian|2009|p=157}}; {{harvnb|Hammerton|1975|p=1011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreas received a French education, and went to [[Paris]] in 1875 to study law at the [[University of Paris]]. While in France, he began associating with literary circles, and became acquainted with [[:fr:Les Hydropathes|Les Hydropathes]], a group of French writers that included [[Alphonse Allais]], [[Charles Cros]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], and [[Léon Bloy]]. He was also an acquaintance of the Greek artist [[Demetrios Galanis]] and the [[Romania]]n poet [[Ion Minulescu]].

Moréas died in [[Paris]], France on March 31, 1910.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Works==
Moréas published poetry in his publications ''Lutèce'' and ''Le Chat noir'', and collected his poems into two editions, ''Les Syrtes'' ("The Sandbanks") and ''Cantilènes'', which were strongly influenced by [[Paul Verlaine]].

He was initially a practitioner of the style of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and wrote the ''[[Symbolist Manifesto]]'' (1886), which he published in the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'', partly to redeem the reputation of the new generation of young writers from the charge of "[[decadent movement|decadence]]" that the press had implied. He was considered one of the most important Symbolist poets until the early 1890s.

In 1891, as Symbolism became more openly associated with [[anarchism]], he published ''Le Pèlerin passionné'' which rejected [[Northern Europe]]an and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] influences, such as [[Romanticism]] (as well as some aspects of Symbolism), in favor of [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] influences. This work helped initiate the ''École Romane'', the aesthetic of which provided [[Charles Maurras]] with the ideology necessary for the [[far-right]] philosophy ''[[Action Française]]''.

Moréas also wrote ''Les Demoiselles Goubert'', a [[novel]], in association with [[Paul Adam (French novelist)|Paul Adam]]. His most important publications were:

*''Les Syrtes'' (1884)
*''Les Cantilènes'' (1886)
*''Le Pèlerin passionné'' (1891)
*''Stances'' (1893)
*''Contes de la vielle France'' (1904)

'''''Jeanne Eagels''''' (also titled '''''The Jeanne Eagels Story''''') is a 1957 American [[biographical film]] loosely based on the life of stage star [[Jeanne Eagels]]. Distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film was produced and directed by [[George Sidney]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[John Fante]], [[Daniel Fuchs]] and [[Sonya Levien]], based on a story by Fuchs.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; July 24, 1957, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; July 20, 1957, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Kim Novak]] in the title role. [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], [[Larry Gates]], [[Virginia Grey]], [[Gene Lockhart]] and [[Murray Hamilton]] co-star.

Many aspects of Eagels' real life were omitted or largely fictionalized. Eagels' family later sued Columbia Pictures over the way Eagels was depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/97099/Jeanne-Eagels/overview|title=Jeanne Eagels (1957)|last=Erickson|first=Hal|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Jeanne Eagels is a Kansas City waitress. After losing a carnival's beauty contest, she asks carny owner Sal Satori for a job. Her dancing in a skimpy costume is accused of being obscene. Sal decides to join his brother in New York and invites Jeanne to join them in an amusement park at [[Coney Island]].

Taking acting lessons instead, the ambitious Jeanne becomes the understudy in a Broadway show and a star when she gets a chance to play the part. A once successful actress named Elsie Desmond wants to make a comeback in a new play, but Jeanne betrays her and takes the play for herself, willing to do anything to get ahead. Elsie denounces her in the theater before the first performance, then commits suicide. Sal is disgusted by Jeanne's behavior as well. She accepts a proposal from a ne'er-do-well named John Donahue, but both descend into alcoholism. Jeanne misses performances and causes fellow actors to lose out on paychecks.

Her situation deteriorates further when she's required to pay alimony to John after a divorce. A new play fails because Jeanne, drunk and on pills, collapses on stage. The actors' guild suspends her for 18 months. Unable to work, she returns to Sal's amusement park and is offered a job dancing. Another performer sexually assaults her in a dressing room. Jeanne, her life in ruins, continues to spiral downward and hallucinate. While trying to make it to a stage one night, she collapses on the staircase and dies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">'''Joel (Jo) Walker''', also known as '''JOEL''' or '''Sculptress JOEL'''  is an English sculptor, [[animalier]], known for depicting animals. 

She was commissioned to make a statue of a dog for [[Garsdale railway station]] ([[Settle-Carlisle Railway]]). She was chosen for her detailed work, and portraits of animals. This project attracted the attention of the media including the national press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2645720/Dog-who-stayed-by-dead-masters-side-for-11-weeks-honoured-with-statue.html  Dog who stayed by dead master's side for 11 weeks honoured with statue], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

She has won prizes for her work including the  [http://www.giftoftheyear.co.uk/ Gift of the Year award] 1994 (Collectibles and Figurines).  
Her work is generally figurative in style, capturing the detailed expressions and attributes of her subjects. Most sculptures are cast by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax process]] into Bronze.

Her sculptures have also been used by different Societies as awards and trophies, and in the past she has specialized in the portraits of famous breeds of horses, such as the [[Shire horse]] and [[Shetland pony|Shetland ponies]]. This led to the commission of the centenary sculptures for the Welsh Pony and Cob Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpcs.uk.com/ Welsh Pony and Cob Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sculpture by the Sculptress JOEL of a famous equestrian subject is that of [[Lady Godiva]]. This brave lady is shown to be riding out on her quest for justice, her head lifted up, one hand holding the mane of the fine Spanish stallion  and her  other hand  gripping the folds of her fallen cloak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutlandopenstudios.co.uk/photo_3818925.html Rutland Open Studios]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Juno and Argus''''' is a 1610 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], showing [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. It is now in the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] (inventory number '''WRM 1040''') in [[Cologne]].
&lt;!---
== Beschreibung ==
Man erkennt niedlich-feiste [[Putte]]n mit einer Haut, die in zahlreichen rosafarbenen Abstufungen glänzt. Diese Haut steht im Gegensatz zur fahlen Hautfarbe eines dargestellten Enthaupteten. Obwohl die Putten mit den Federn des [[Asiatische Pfauen|Pfaus]] spielen und trotz der farbenprächtigen Gewänder der dargestellten Personen, handelt es sich um eine grausame Szene: Akribisch lösen die beiden Frauen mit einer Art [[Pinzette]] die Augen aus dem abgeschlagenen Kopf. Hinter der mythologischen Geschichte des Bildes verbirgt sich darüber hinaus ein kunsttheoretischer Gedanke.

== Bildthema ==

[[Iuno|Juno]], die Gattin des [[Iuppiter|Jupiter]], mit goldenem [[Diadem]] gekrönt und intensiv rotem, in vielen Farbnuancen leuchtenden Gewand bekleidet, verrichtet diese makabre Arbeit, tatkräftig unterstützt von Iris, der Göttin in Blau. Die hundert Augen des Getöteten, der [[Argos (Riese)|Argus]] hieß, werden dann von Juno in den Schwanz ihres Pfaus eingesetzt.

Der antike Dichter [[Ovid]] überliefert in seinen Metamorphosen die Geschichte, die Peter Paul Rubens dargestellt hat (Ovid, [[Metamorphosen (Ovid)|Metamorphosen]] I, 721–724). Jupiter, der Seitensprüngen nie abgeneigt war, wurde bei einem Treffen mit der schönen [[Io (Mythologie)|Io]] von seiner Frau Juno überrascht. Gerade noch rechtzeitig verwandelt der Göttervater seine Geliebte in eine schneeweiße Kuh. Auch als Kuh ist sie schön, und Juno muss ihre Schönheit loben. Doch dann erbittet Juno das Tier als Geschenk. Um sich nicht zu verraten, bleibt Jupiter nichts anderes übrig, als ihrem Wunsch zu entsprechen. Die misstrauische Juno aber fürchtet zu Recht, dass ihr die Kuh entwendet werden könnte und übergibt sie schließlich in die Obhut des Argus. ''Rings um den Kopf hatte er hundert Augen. Von diesen schlossen sich abwechselnd jeweils zwei zur Ruhe, die übrigen gaben acht und blieben auf Wache'', schreibt Ovid.

Jupiter ist diese Situation unerträglich. So schickt er den schwatzhaften Götterboten [[Mercurius|Merkur]], um Io zu befreien. Merkur nun erzählt Argus mit vielen Worten und ruhiger Stimme lange Geschichten. Und tatsächlich, irgendwann waren ''sämtliche Augen des Argus, vom Schlaf überwältigt, geschlossen''. (…) Merkur ''zückt sein krummes Schwert und schlägt damit Argus – der nickt im Schlaf – dort eine Wunde, wo sich das Haupt mit dem Halse verbindet.''

Auf diesem Bild, das um 1610 entstanden sein dürfte, sind die Göttinnen jetzt damit befasst, dem toten Argus gleichsam ein Denkmal zu setzen. Auf den Federn des Pfaus sollen Argus’ Augen fortleben. Dem Einsetzen der Argus-Augen in das Gefieder des Pfaus begegnet man in der Kunst nur sehr selten. In der Regel wählten die Künstler den Augenblick vor der Enthauptung. Auch Rubens selbst hat auf einem anderen Gemälde, das er für die Ausstattung eines Lustschlosses des spanischen Königs [[Philipp IV. (Spanien)|Philipp IV.]] geschaffen hat, diesen Moment der Tötung des Argus dargestellt. Das Bild hängt heute im [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] in Madrid, – entstanden ist es um 1636/38.

== Deutung ==
Welche Gründe Peter Paul Rubens bewogen haben, die seltene Szene dieses Bildes auszuwählen, ist unklar. Am Ende des Textes von Ovid heißt es: ''Erloschen ist das Licht, das in so vielen Augen Dir strahlte! Hundert Augen deckte nun eine Nacht!'' Die Geschichte dreht sich also auch um das Thema Licht und Dunkel, um Optik. Verfolgt man diese Gedanken weiter, so fällt auf, dass Rubens „Iris“ mit ins Bild setzt, die bei Ovid in der Argus-Geschichte gar nicht vorkommt. Iris ist eine Götterbotin, die Juno zu Diensten steht. Iris heißt im Griechischen „Regenbogen“. Und ein Regenbogen schafft im Bild zwischen der himmlischen und der irdischen Sphäre eine Verbindung. „Iris“ wird auch der Teil des menschlichen Auges genannt, der die Pupille umgibt. Auch hier also besteht eine Beziehung zur Optik.

Ein Farbakkord beginnt mit gelb/gold rechts im Bild am Wagen und am Gewand der Juno – bei der Frau auf dem Wagen wird es sich um eine weitere Dienerin Junos handeln. Dann setzt er sich über die große Fläche des intensiven Rots von Junos Gewand fort und führt sodann zum blauen Kleid der Iris. Diesem Akkord begegnet man – durch ergänzte Mischfarben – im Regenbogen wieder.
„Blau, Rot, Gelb“ sind die zentralen Farben der Farbenlehre, die sich in den ''Sechs Büchern über die Optik'' des Antwerpener Jesuitenpaters [[Franciscus Aguilonius]] findet. Aguilons Buch, in Antwerpen gedruckt, und Rubens’ Bild sind etwa gleichzeitig entstanden. Wie weit sich Rubens und Aguilon kannten, ist unbekannt, doch feststeht, dass Rubens zu Aguilons Werk das Titelbild entwarf. Es fällt auf – und auch dies gehört zum Bereich optischer Wahrnehmung –, wie brillant es Rubens vermochte, unterschiedlichste Hauttönungen darzustellen. Unzählige Farbnuancen von rosa bis weiß bilden die rosige Haut der Putten und die etwas weißere Haut der Göttinnen. Der muskulöse Leichnam des Argus aber hat schon die fahlen Farben des Todes angenommen. Ebenso grandios hat es Rubens vermocht, Stoffe wiederzugeben. Das Licht scheint sich hundertfach in den Gewändern zu brechen. So erzeugen die zahllosen Farbtöne, die virtuos – zum Teil mit dickem Pinselstrich – gesetzt wurden, den Eindruck einer sehr schweren, festen Seide. Rubens theoretisiert also nicht nur über optische Effekte, sondern er setzt sie auch aufs trefflichste in seiner Malerei um.

Schließlich seien weitere Bedeutungsebenen des Argus-Mythos nicht verschwiegen, die bei Rubens wenigstens mitschwingen dürften. Der niederländische Kunsttheoretiker [[Karel van Mander (1548–1606)|Karel van Mander]], der 1604 eine damals vielgelesene Auslegung der Metamorphosen Ovids verfasste, interpretierte Argus als den menschlichen Verstand, der der (tierischen) Io beigegeben wird. Der Verstand aber wird durch Merkur in einen wollüstigen Schlaf versetzt und wurde daher verletzlich.
In der [[Emblematik]], d. h. in Sinngedichtsammlungen, denen jeweils kleine Illustrationen zur Seite gestellt wurden, findet man ebenfalls die Argus-Geschichte. Dort heißt es zum Beispiel: ''Niemand ist so wachsam, dass ihn nicht ein süßer Schmeichler unter dem Schein der Freundschaft täuschen könnte.''

==Reception==
{{quotebox
|quote="I was wary of watching ''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'' because the cartoon hasn't been true to its original spirit in the last few seasons. Episodes have been missing that special ingredient, if you will, that they had in early seasons. Recent specials, such as "[[The Great Patty Caper|Mystery with a Twistery]]" and "[[The Clash of Triton|Clash of the Tritons]]" were too slick, over-reaching and had only moments of the old brilliance. However, the episodes on ''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' are hilarious and destined to become favorites."

''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' received positive reviews from media critics. Nancy Basile of [[About.com]] positively reacted to the series and gave it a 4 out of 5 rating.&lt;ref name=Basile&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title='SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/spongebobsquarepants/fr/Legends-Of-Bikini-Bottom.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cited her favorite episodes like "Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Triangle" and "The Main Drain".&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; She said "Firstly, you know an episode will be funny when it's titled 'Bikini Bottom Triangle'. My children had no idea why I was laughing at the title frame."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; her favorite scenes from the episode were "Gary's booty, watching the old sea dog spit his story and figuring out why Patrick wears cuff links."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; In another episode called "The Main Drain", she said "I won't ruin the set up because it's just so funny, but my favorite line is, 'It's now or never.' You have to see it to know why."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt;

In his review for the [[DVD Talk]], Paul Mavis said "''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'' is all-new, and therein lies what has {{sic|becoming}} increasingly routine: haphazard quality. Some are mildly amusing, and others blow their promising set-ups."&lt;ref name=Mavis&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavis|first=Paul|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/46762/spongebob-squarepants-legends-of-bikini-bottom/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added "Still, 'The Main Drain' and 'Trenchbillies' are fairly funny, while the magical warrior dolphin in 'Sponge-Cano!' may be worth the price of admission alone here."&lt;ref name=Mavis/&gt;

Danielle Sullivan of [[Babble.com]] said "My 13-year-old still loves ''SpongeBob'' and his quirky underwater friends, and I have to admit that the show makes me laugh a lot. It’s one of those unique blends that appeals to kids and parents." Michelle Lincaster of AllVoices, on the airing of the series on Facebook, said "''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has a 16,000,000 fan following on Facebook so the premiere of ''The Legends of Bikini Bottom'' on Facebook shouldn't come as a surprise."&lt;ref name=AllVoices/&gt;

Jeff Robbins of the [[DVD Verdict]] was mixed on the series and said "''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'', get ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''."&lt;ref name=Verdict&gt;{{cite web|last=Robbins|first=Jeff|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendsbikinibottom.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=12 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922024402/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendsbikinibottom.php|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing "The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom", he said "What is also notable here is the episode's ending, which features a brilliant call-back to an earlier seen flashback (more shades of ''Lost'') that ties up the threads of the episode as well as any [[Larry David]] penned half-hour. This first short is ''SpongeBob'' at its best." Robbins called "The Main Drain" as "Not a good episode." and "Sponge-Cano!" as "A strong segment."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; In reviewing "The Curse of the Hex", Robbins said "Unfortunately, this lousy episode ends the disc on a sour note as a hagfish curses The [[Krusty Krab]]. The only notable aspect to this dull segment is that the hagfish is voiced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s [[Kristen Wiig]], which, depending on your current view of the comedy institution, may make the episode more or less interesting. Either the writers got tired of attempting allusions to ''Lost'' by this point, or I simply got tired of looking for them."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

'''Lightfastness''' is a property of a [[colourant]] such as [[dye]] or [[pigment]] that describes how resistant to fading it is when exposed to light.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/artglossaryl/g/lightfastness.htm|title=Art Glossary: Lightfastness|publisher=[[About.com]]|first=Marion|last=Boddy-Evans|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Simmons |first=Rosemary |authorlink=Rosemary Simmons |date=2002 |title=Dictionary of Printmaking Terms |publisher=A &amp; C Black (Publishers) Ltd. |page=30 |isbn=978-0-7136-5795-1 |language=English|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=printwiki&gt;{{cite web |url=http://printwiki.org/Lightfastness |title=Lightfastness |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Printwiki |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyes and pigments are used for example for [[dyeing]] of [[fabric]]s, [[plastic]]s or other materials and manufacturing [[paint]]s or [[printing ink]]s.

The bleaching of the color is caused by the impact of [[ultraviolet radiation]] in the chemical structure of the [[molecule]]s giving the color of the subject. The part of a molecule responsible for its color is called the [[chromophore]].&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01076.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book: Chromophore |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=IUPAC – International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malkonen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mälkönen |first=Pentti |authorlink= |date=1979 |title=Orgaaninen kemia |publisher=Otava |pages=237–238 |isbn=951-1-05378-7 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light encountering a painted surface can either alter or break the [[chemical bond]]s of the pigment, causing the colors to [[bleach]] or change in a process known as [[photodegradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/colors.html|title=Why does ultraviolet light cause colors to fade?|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials that resist this effect are said to be '''lightfast'''. The [[electromagnetic spectrum]] of the sun contains [[wavelength]]s from gamma waves to radio waves. The high energy of [[ultraviolet radiation]] in particular accelerates the fading of the dye.&lt;ref name=kumar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textilelearner.blogspot.fi/2014/09/light-fastness-of-textiles-factors.html |title=Light Fastness of Textiles: Factors Affecting and Control Measures|publisher=Textile Learner|first=|last=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[photon energy]] of [[Ultraviolet A|UVA]]-radiation which is not absorbed by atmospheric [[ozone]] exceeds the [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] energy of the carbon-carbon [[single bond]], resulting in the [[bond cleavage|cleavage]] of the bond and fading of the color.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt; [[Inorganic]] colourants are considered to be more lightfast than [[organic matter|organic]] colourants.&lt;ref name=dyespigments&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dyes-pigment.com/organic-vs-inorganic-pigments.html |title=Organic vs Inorganic Pigments |date= |website= |publisher=Kolorjet Chemicals Pvt Ltd |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black colourants are usually considered the most lightfast.&lt;ref name=carbonblack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dyes-pigment.com/carbon-black.html |title=Art Glossary: Carbon Black |date= |website= |publisher=Kolorjet Chemicals Pvt Ltd |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightfastness is measured by exposing a sample to a [[lightsource]] for a predefined period of time and then comparing it to an unexposed sample.&lt;ref name="simmons"/&gt;&lt;ref name=printwiki/&gt;&lt;ref name="macevoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=lightfastness tests|url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#lightfast |publisher=Bruce MacEvoy|year=2015|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical processes==

During the fading colourant molecules undergo various chemical processes which result in fading.

When a [[photon|UV-photon]] reacts with a molecule acting as colourant, the molecule is [[excited state|excited]] from the [[ground state]] to an excited state. The excited molecule is highly reactive and unstable. During the [[quenching]] of the molecule from excited state to ground state, atmospheric [[triplet oxygen]] reacts with the colourant molecule to form [[singlet oxygen]] and [[superoxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|oxygen radical]]. The oxygen atom and the superoxide radical resulting from the reaction are both highly reactive and capable of destroying the colourants.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

=== Photolysis ===

[[Photolysis]], ''i.e.,'' [[photochemical]] decomposition is a chemical reaction where the [[Chemical compound|compound]] is broken down by the photons. This decomposition occurs when a photon of sufficient energy encounters a colorant molecule bond with a suitable dissociation energy. The reaction causes [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] [[Bond cleavage|cleavage]] in the chromophoric system resulting the fading of the colourant.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

=== Photo-oxidation ===

[[Photo-oxidation]], ''i.e.,'' photochemical [[Redox|oxidation]]. A colorant molecule, when excited by a photon of sufficient energy, undergoes an oxidation process. In the process the chromophoric system of the colorant molecule reacts with the atmospheric oxygen to form a non-chromophoric system, resulting in fading. Colorants which contain a [[carbonyl group]] as the chromophore are particularly vulnerable to oxidation.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

=== Photoreduction ===

[[Photoreduction|Photo-reduction]], ''i.e.,'' photochemical [[Redox|reduction]]. A colorant molecule with an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[double bond]] (typical to [[alkene]]s) or [[triple bond]] (typical to [[alkyne]]s) acting as a chromophore undergoes reduction in the presence of hydrogen and photons of sufficient energy, forming a saturated chromophoric system. Saturation reduces the length of the chromophoric system, resulting in the fading of the colorant.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

=== Photosensitization ===

[[Photosensitizer|Photosensitization]], ''i.e.,'' photochemical sensitization. Exposing dyed [[Cellulose|cellulosic]] material, such as plant-based fibers, to sunlight allows dyes to remove hydrogen from the cellulose, resulting in photoreduction on the cellulosic substrate. Simultaneously, the colorant will undergo oxidation in the presence of the atmospheric oxygen, resulting in photo-oxidation of the colourant. These processes result in both fading of the colorant and strength loss of the substrate.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

=== Phototendering ===

[[Phototendering]], ''i.e.,'' photochemical tendering. As a result of UV light, the substrate material supplies hydrogen to the colourant molecules,  reducing the colorant molecule. As the hydrogen is removed, the material undergoes oxidation.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

== Standards and measure scales ==

Some organizations publish standards for rating the lightfastness of pigments and materials.  Testing is typically done by controlled [[Radiant exposure|exposure]] to [[sunlight]], or to artificial light generated by a [[xenon arc lamp]].&lt;ref name="ASTM"&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = https://www.astm.org/Standards/D4303.htm

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Watercolors]], [[ink]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[colored pencil]]s are particularly susceptible to fading over time, so choosing lightfast pigments is especially important in these media.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The most well known scales measuring the lightfastness are the [[Blue Wool Scale]], Grey scale and the scale defined by ASTM (American Standard Test Measure).&lt;ref name="ASTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isobluewooldaylight"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Blue Wool Scale]] the lightfastness is rated between 1–8. 1 being very poor and 8 being excellent lightfastness. In grey scale the lightfastness is rated between 1–5. 1 being very poor and 5 being excellent lightfastness.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name="simmons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macevoy"/&gt; On ASTM scale the lightfastness is rated between I-V. I is excellent lightfastness and it corresponds to ratings 7–8 on [[Blue Wool Scale]]. V is very poor lightfastness and it corresponds to Blue Wool scale rating 1.&lt;ref name="macevoy"/&gt;

[[File:Metropolia sign bleached.jpg|thumb|Side of a sign of the University of Applied Sciences oriented towards to [[southeast]] where direct sunlight impacting from [[dawn]] to [[afternoon]] has bleached the red and yellow colors from the logo of the institution.]]

[[File:Metropolia sign unbleached.jpg|thumb|Side of the sign oriented towards to [[northwest]] where the red and yellow colors can still be clearly recognized.]]
The actual lightfastness is dependent on the strength of the radiation of the sun, so lightfastness is relative to [[Location (geography)|geographic location]], [[season]], and exposure direction. The following table is listing suggestive relations of the lightfastness ratings on different measure scales and the relation relative to time in direct sunlight and normal conditions of display: away from a window, under indirect sunlight and properly framed behind a UV protective glass.&lt;ref name="macevoy"/&gt;

== Test procedure ==

Relative amount of fading can be measured and studied by using standard test stripes. In the workflow of Blue Wool test one reference stripe set shall be stored protected from any exposure of light. Simultaneously with samples another equivalent test stripe set is exposed under the light source defined in the standard. For example, if the lightfastness of the colourant is indicated to be 5 on Blue Wool scale, it can be expected to fade similar amount as the strip number 5 in Blue Wool test strip set. The accomplishment of the test can be confirmed by comparing the test stripe set with the reference set stored protected from the light.&lt;ref name="isobluewooldaylight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isobluewoolartifaciallight"/&gt;

== In graphical industry ==

In printing inks mainly organic pigments are used, so shifting or bleaching of the color of a printing product due to presence of the UV light is usually just a matter of time. The usage of the organic pigments is justified especially by their inexpensive price comparing to inorganic pigments. The particle size of the inorganic pigments is often larger than on organic pigments thus all inorganic pigments are not suitable to be used in the [[offset printing]].&lt;ref name="basf"&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = https://www.dispersions-pigments.basf.com/portal/basf/ien/dt.jsp?setCursor=1_561069
 | title = Pigments

 | language = English
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[screen printing]] the particle size of the pigment is not limiting factor. Thus it is preferred printing method for printing print jobs requiring extreme lightfastness. Thickness of the ink layer effects to the lightfastness by the amount of pigment laid on the substrate. Ink layer printed by the screen printing is thicker than layer printed on offset printing. In other words, it contains more pigment per area. This leads to better lightfastness even though the used printing ink in both methods would be based on the same pigment.&lt;ref name=kumar/&gt;

When mixing the printing inks the lightfastness of the ink being weaker by its lightfastness defines the lightfastness of the whole color. The fading of one of the pigments leads to tone shift towards to component with better lightfastness. If it is required that there will be something visible from the printing even though its dominant pigment would fade, small amount of pigment with excellent lightfastness can be mixed with it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45807">The following is a '''list of winners and shortlisted authors of the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for [[Fiction]]'''. Winning titles are listed in yellow, first in their year.

The prize has been awarded each year since 1969 to the best original full-length novel, written in the English language, by a citizen of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 2014, it was opened for the first time to any work published in the United Kingdom and in the English language.

There have been three special awards celebrating the Booker's history. In 1993, the "[[Booker of Bookers]]" prize was awarded to [[Salman Rushdie]] for ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (the 1981 winner) as the best novel to win the award in its first 25 years. ''Midnight's Children'' also won a public vote in 2008, on the prize's fortieth anniversary, "[[The Best of the Booker]]". In 2018 a special "Golden Booker" was awarded celebrating 50 years of the award - this award was won by [[Michael Ondaatje]] for ''[[The English Patient]]''.

At the same time the award moved from April to November and, as a result, a wealth of fiction published for much of 1970 fell through the net and was never considered for the prize."

'''''Lobster Telephone''''' (also known as '''''Aphrodisiac Telephone''''') is a [[Surrealism|Surrealist object]], created by [[Salvador Dalí]] in 1936 for the English poet [[Edward James]] (1907–1984), a leading collector of surrealist art. In his book ''The Secret Life'', Dalí wrote teasingly of his demand to know why, when he asked for a grilled [[lobster]] in a restaurant, he was never presented with a boiled telephone.&lt;ref name="SLSD"&gt;Dalí, S. &amp; Chevalier, H. (1993). ''The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí''. Dover Publications: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The work is a composite of an ordinary working [[telephone]] and a [[lobster]] made of [[plaster]].  It is approximately 15 × 30 × 17&amp;nbsp;cm (6 × 12 × 6.6&amp;nbsp;inches) in size.

This is a classic example of a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] object, made from the conjunction of items not normally associated with each other, resulting in something both playful and menacing. Dalí believed that such objects could reveal the secret desires of the unconscious. Lobsters and telephones had strong sexual connotations for Dalí. The telephone appears in certain paintings of the late 1930s such as ''Mountain Lake'' ([[Tate]]), and the lobster appears in drawings and designs, usually associated with erotic pleasure and pain. For the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], Dalí created a multi-media experience entitled ''[[Dream of Venus]]'',&lt;ref name=DrmVns&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Ingrid, Photogr. by Eric Schaal|title=Salvador Dalí's "Dream of Venus" : the surrealist funhouse from the 1939 World's Fair|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1568983592|edition=1. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted in part of dressing live nude models in "costumes" made of fresh seafood, an event photographed by [[Horst P. Horst]] and [[George Platt Lynes]]. A lobster was used by the artist to cover the female sexual organs of his models. Dalí often drew a close analogy between food and sex. In ''Lobster Telephone'', the crustacean's tail, where its sexual parts are located, is placed directly over the mouthpiece.&lt;ref name="SLSD" /&gt;

In 1935 Dalí was commissioned by the magazine ''[[American Weekly]]'' to execute a series of drawings based on his impressions of New York. One drawing was given the caption 'NEW YORK DREAM - MAN FINDS LOBSTER IN PLACE OF PHONE'. In the ''Dictionnaire Abrégé du Surréalisme'' of 1938, Dalí contributed an entry under 'TÉLÉPHONE APHRODISIAQUE' which is accompanied by a small drawing of a telephone, its receiver replaced by a lobster surrounded by flies. A similar drawing is printed in ''The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí'' which contains the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not understand why, when I ask for a grilled lobster in a restaurant, I am never served a cooked telephone; I do not understand why champagne is always chilled and why on the other hand telephones, which are habitually so frightfully warm and disagreeably sticky to the touch, are not also put in silver buckets with crushed ice around them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Telephone frappé, mint-coloured telephone, aphrodisiac telephone, lobster-telephone, telephone sheathed in sable for the boudoirs of sirens with fingernails protected with ermine, Edgar Allan Poe telephones with a dead rat concealed within, Boecklin telephones installed inside a cypress tree (and with an allegory of death in inlaid silver on their backs), telephones on the leash which would walk about, screwed to the back of a living turtle ... telephones ... telephones ... telephones ...&lt;ref name="SLSD" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Present location and exhibition==
[[Image:Aphrodisiac_Telephone_1938_MIA_962.jpg|thumb|250px|''Aphrodisiac Telephone'' (1938) [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]]]
Dalí  produced five examples of the color version of his telephone. One was on display at the [[Dalí Universe]] in London; a second can be found at the [[Museum für Kommunikation Frankfurt]]; another is owned by the [[Edward James]] Foundation; a fourth is at the [[National Gallery of Australia]]; and the fifth example is in the collection of [[Tate Modern]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=2988 ''Lobster Telephone''] in the collection of Tate Liverpool, London. Accessed 27-01-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí  also produced an off-white version of his telephone. Of the six known examples, one is owned by the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]; another by the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. A third example is held at [[Centro Cultural de Belém]], in Portugal, and is owned by the art collector Joe Berardo. Another exemplar can be viewed at the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]] (JAG) in Johannesburg, South Africa.

In March 2018, Arts minister Michael Ellis had put a temporary export ban on the ''Lobster Telephone'', and if British artwork collectors would like to purchase it, the cost would be £850,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/temporary-export-ban-slapped-on-lobster-phone-to-stop-salvador-dali-artwork-leaving-uk-11301187|title=Temporary export ban slapped on lobster phone to stop Salvador Dali artwork leaving UK|publisher=Sky News|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50765">Japan's medieval period (the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]], [[Nanbokuchō period|Nanbokuchō]] and [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] periods) was a transitional period for the nation's literature. [[Kyoto]] ceased being the sole literary centre as important writers and readerships appeared throughout the country, and a wider variety of genres and literary forms developed accordingly, such as the ''[[gunki monogatari]]'' and ''[[otogi-zōshi]]'' prose narratives, and ''[[renga]]'' linked verse.

== Overview ==
[[History of Japan#Medieval Japan|Japan's medieval period]] lasted roughly 400 years from [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]'s establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] and being named [[shōgun]] in [[Kenkyū|Kenkyū 3]] (1192) to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]'s establishment of the [[Edo shogunate]] in [[Keichō|Keichō 8]] (1603) following the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in Keichō 5 (1600) that began the [[Edo period]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} This period, based on the centres of political power, is normally divided into the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]], [[Nanbokuchō period|Nanbokuchō (or Yoshino)]], [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] and [[Azuchi–Momoyama period|Azuchi–Momoyama]] periods, and is also referred to simply as the [[Kamakura-Muromachi period]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} The start date of this period has also been taken as being around 1156 (the [[Hōgen rebellion]]) or 1221 (the [[Jōkyū rebellion]]), with the Azuchi–Momoyama period also sometimes being taken as part of the [[History of Japan#Early modern Japan|early modern period]], with the medieval period ending at [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry to [[Kyoto|the capital]] in [[Eiroku|Eiroku 11]] (1568) or the end of the Ashikaga regime in [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō 1]] (1573).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

The period is characterized by war, beginning with the [[Genpei War]] and ending with the Battle of Sekigahara, with other conflicts such as the Jōkyū rebellion, the war between the [[Northern Court|northern]] and [[Southern Court|southern court]]s and the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477), culminating in the entire country erupting in war during the [[Sengoku period]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} The social order was disrupted as a result of these conflicts, with changes to society in general and, naturally, shifts in literary styles and tastes.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} The philosophy of [[impermanence]] (無常 ''mujō'') became pervasive, with many seeking salvation, both physical and spiritual, in religion, specifically [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

=== Aesthetic ideals ===
The basic ideal that informed aesthetic tastes in this period is known as ''[[yūgen]]'', along with other concepts such as ''[[yūshin]]'' (有心) and ''[[yōen]]'' (妖艶).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} These ideals shunned realism, representing a spirit of ''[[l'art pour l'art]]'' and aiming to plunge the reader into an "ideal" world, and were in accord with the ideals of Buddhist monastic seclusion (出家遁世 ''shukke-tonsei'').{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} What exactly constituted ''yūgen'' differed throughout its history, and the various literary genres it influenced include ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'', ''[[renga]]'' and ''[[noh]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Later developments include ''[[en (literature)|en]]'' (艶), ''[[hie (literature)|hie]]'' (ひえ) and ''[[wabi-sabi|sabi]]'', connecting to the [[Edo literature|literature of Japan's early modern period]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

Translator and literary historian [[Donald Keene]] discusses both ''yūgen'' and ''hie'' (which he translated "chill") as concepts shared by the quintessentially medieval art forms of ''renga'' and ''noh''.{{sfnm|1a1=Keene|1y=1999|1pp=999–1000}} He describes ''sabi'' as having been "used to suggest the unobtrusive, unassertive beauty that was the ideal of Japanese poets, especially during the turbulent decades of the Japanese middle ages",{{sfnm|1a1=Keene|1y=1999|1loc=689, note 73}} and states that it first came to prominence around the time of the ''[[Shin-kokin Wakashū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Keene|1y=1999|1loc=661}}

There was, however, a concurrent trend toward a form of realism in medieval developments on the concept of ''[[okashi]]'' (をかし).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Authors began to attempt to reflect reality in order satirize social conditions, or for simple enjoyment.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

=== Authors and readership ===
Medieval Japanese literature is most often associated with members of the [[samurai|warrior class]], religious figures and hermits (隠者 ''inja''), but the [[kuge|nobility]] maintained a degree of their former prestige and occupied an important position in literary circles.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} This was especially true in the early middle ages (i.e., the Kamakura period), when court literature still carried the high pedigree of earlier eras, while monks, recluses and warriors took an increasingly prominent role in later centuries.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Furthermore, at the very end of the medieval period (i.e., the Azuchi–Momoyama period), urban (''[[chōnin]]'') literature began to appear.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} This led {{illm|Teiji Ichiko|ja|市古貞次}}, in his article on medieval literature for the ''[[Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten]]'', to conclude that the medieval period was the time when the literature of the nobility became a truly national [[Japanese literature]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

Developments in the performing arts allowed for large groups of people to appreciate literature on a broader level than before.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} As the social classes that had previously supported the arts fell away, new groups stepped in as both creators and audiences for literary works.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} These conditions encouraged the growth of a literature that was more visual and auditory than the [[Heian literature|literature of Japanese classical period]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} This is true of performing arts like ''nō'' and [[buyō|traditional dance]], but also includes such genres as the ''[[emakimono]]'', which combined words and images, and ''[[e-toki]]'', which conveyed tales and Buddhist parables via images.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

The centre of culture continued to be the capital in Kyoto, but other areas such as [[Ise, Mie|Ise]] and [[Kamakura]] became increasingly prominent as literary centres.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

== Literature of the early medieval period ==
=== Historical background of the early medieval period ===
The early medieval period covers the time between the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate and the shogunate's collapse roughly 140 years later in [[Genkō (second)|Genkō 3]] (1333).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} With the shogunate, who were of warrior stock, controlling the affairs of state in eastern Japan, the aristocracy of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|Heian court]] continued to perform limited court functions and attempted to preserve the aristocratic literary traditions of the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} The first two or three decades, which are also known as the ''Shin-kokin'' period, saw a surge in interest in ''waka'' composition and attempts to revive the traditions of the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} However, with the failure of the Jōkyū rebellion and [[Emperor Go-Toba]]'s exile to [[Oki Island]], the court lost almost all power, and the nobility became increasingly nostalgic, with the aristocratic literature of the later Kamakura period reflecting this.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

As the warrior class was in its ascendancy, their cultural and philosophical traditions began to influence not only political but also literary developments, and while literature had been previously the exclusive domain of the court this period saw a growth in the literature of other levels of society.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Narrative works such as ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' are an example of this new literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

Buddhism was also in its heyday during this period, with new sects such as [[Jōdo-shū]], [[Nichiren-shū]] and [[Zen Buddhism|Zen-shū]] being established, and both old and new sects fervently spreading their influence among the populace throughout the country.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} In addition to [[Buddhist literature]] such as ''[[hōgo]]'', the monks of this period were especially active in all manner of literary pursuits.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Those who became hermits upon entering Buddhism produced a new kind of essay, the ''[[zuihitsu]]'', as well as fine examples of ''[[setsuwa]]'' literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Such literature is known as [[hermit literature]] (隠者文学 ''inja-bungaku'' or 草庵文学 ''sōan-bungaku'', "thatched-hut literature").{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

Overall, the literature of this period showed a strong tendency to combine the new with the old, mixing the culture of aristocrats, warriors and Buddhist monks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

=== Early medieval ''waka'' ===
The ''waka'' genre saw an unprecedented level of exuberance at the beginning of the Kamakura period, with Emperor Go-Toba reopening the [[Waka-dokoro]] in [[Kennin|Kennin 1]] (1201).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Notable, and prolific, poets at the highest levels of the aristocracy included [[Fujiwara no Yoshitsune]] and his uncle, the [[Tendai]] abbot [[Jien]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} At both the [[Heian imperial palace|palace]] and the homes of various aristocrats, poetry gatherings (''[[uta-kai]]'') and competitions (''[[uta-awase]]'') such as the famous ''{{illm|Roppyaku-ban Uta-awase|ja|六百番歌合}}'' and ''{{illm|Sengohyaku-ban Uta-awase|ja|千五百番歌合}}'' were held, with numerous great poets coming to the fore.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} On Go-Toba's command, [[Fujiwara no Teika]], [[Fujiwara no Ietaka]] and others compiled a new ''[[chokusenshū]]'' (imperial ''waka'' anthology), the ''Shin-kokin Wakashū'', which was seen as a continuation of the grand ''waka'' tradition begun three hundred years earlier with the ''[[Kokin Wakashū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Ichiko calls this the final flowering of the aristocratic literature, noting its high literary value with its basis in the literary ideals of ''yūgen'' and ''yūshin'', its emphasis on suggestiveness, and its exquisite delicacy.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}}

The foundations for this style of poetry were laid by Teika and his father [[Fujiwara no Shunzei|Shunzei]], not just in their poetry but in their highly regarded works of poetic theory (''[[karon (poetry)|karon]]'' and ''[[kagaku-sho]]'').{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} These include Shunzei's ''{{illm|Korai Fūtei-shō|ja|古来風体抄}}'' (also valuable as an exploration of the history of ''waka'') and Teika's ''{{illm|Maigetsu-shō|ja|毎月抄}}'' and ''Kindai Shūka'' (近代秀歌).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=258}} Such works had a tremendous influence on later ''waka'' poets, and their philosophy of ''[[fūtei]]'' (風体) has had value for Japanese aesthetics and art generally.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1pp=258–259}} Other works of the ''karon'' genre include those that are noted for their recording of various anecdotes about ''waka'' poets, including [[Kamo no Chōmei]]'s ''{{illm|Mumyō-shō|ja|無名抄}}''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

This flourishing was characteristic of the first three or four decades of the Kamakura period, but following the Jōkyū rebellion and the exile of Go-Toba, the great patron of ''waka'', the genre went into decline.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Teika's son, [[Fujiwara no Tameie]], championed simplicity in ''waka'' composition, writing the ''karon'' work ''[[Eiga no Ittei]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} In the generation following Tameie, the ''waka'' world became divided between schools represented by the three great houses founded by Tameie's sons: [[Nijō family|Nijō]], [[Kyōgoku family|Kyōgoku]] and [[Reizei family|Reizei]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} The conservative [[Nijō school]], founded by Tameie's eldest son, was the most powerful, and with the different schools supporting different political factions (namely the {{illm|Daikakuji-tō|ja|大覚寺統}} and the {{illm|Jimyōin-tō|ja|持明院統}}), there was less emphasis on poetic innovation than on in-fighting, and the genre stagnated.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

The compilation of imperial anthologies, though, actually became more frequent than before, with a ninth anthology, the ''[[Shin-chokusen Wakashū]]'', and continuing on regularly over the following century until the sixteenth, the ''[[Shoku-goshūi Wakashū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Of these eight, the only one that was compiled by a member of the Kyōgoku school was the ''[[Gyokuyō Wakashū]]'', compiled by [[Kyōgoku Tamekane]], and this is considered the second best of the Kamakura anthologies after the ''Shin-kokin Wakashū''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Every other collection was compiled by a Nijō poet, and Ichiko notes that there is little of value in them.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} However, in eastern Japan the third shōgun, [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]], a student of Teika's, showed great poetic skill in his [[kashū (poetry)|personal anthology]], the ''{{illm|Kinkai Wakashū|ja|金槐和歌集}}'', which shows the influence of the much earlier poetry of the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

Overall, while poetic composition at court floundered during the Kamakura period, the courtiers continued the act of collecting and categorizing the poems of earlier eras, with such compilations as the ''{{illm|Fuboku Waka-shō|ja|夫木和歌抄}}'' and the ''[[Mandai Wakashū]]'' (万代和歌集) epitomizing this nostalgic tendency.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

=== ''Monogatari'' ===
Works of courtly fiction continued to be produced by the aristocracy from the Heian period into the Kamakura period, with the early Kamakura work ''[[Mumyō-zōshi]]'', written by a devout fan of ''[[monogatari]]'', particularly ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', emphasizing literary criticism and discussing various ''monogatari'', as well as ''waka'' anthologies and other works by the court ladies.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} The work praises ''Genji'' and then goes on to discuss various works of courtly fiction in roughly chronological order, and is not only the sole work of such literary criticism to survive from this period but is also valuable for detailing the history of the genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

The ''[[Fūyō Wakashū]]'' is a slightly later work that collects the ''waka'' poetry that was included in courtly fiction up to around [[Bun'ei|Bun'ei 8]] (1271).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} This work was compiled on the order of [[Emperor Kameyama]]'s mother [[Ōmiya-in]] (the daughter of [[Saionji Saneuji]]), and shows not only the high place courtly fiction had attained in the tastes of the aristocracy by this time, but the reflective/critical bent with which the genre had come to be addressed in its final years.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Well over a hundred ''monogatari'' appear to have been in circulation at this time, but almost all are lost.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Fewer than twenty survive, and of the surviving works, several such as ''[[Sumiyoshi Monogatari]]'', ''[[Matsuranomiya Monogatari]]'' and ''[[Iwashimizu Monogatari]]'' (石清水物語) have unusual contents.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Other extant ''monogatari'' of this period include''{{illm|Iwade Shinobu|ja|いはでしのぶ}}'', ''{{illm|Wagami ni Tadoru Himegimi|ja|わが身にたどる姫君}}'', ''{{illm|Koke no Koromo|ja|苔の衣}}'' and ''[[Ama no Karumo]]'' (海人の刈藻).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

Late Kamakura works of courtly fiction include ''{{illm|Koiji Yukashiki Taishō|ja|恋路ゆかしき大将}}'', ''{{illm|Sayo-goromo|ja|小夜衣}}'' and ''{{illm|Hyōbu-kyō Monogatari|ja|兵部卿物語}}'', and these works in particular show a very strong influence from earlier works, in particular ''The Tale of Genji'', in terms of structure and language.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Long works of courtly fiction at this time were almost all ''{{illm|giko monogatari|ja|擬古物語}}'', or works imitative of past ''monogatari'', and production of them largely ceased during the Nanbokuchō period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

=== Early medieval ''rekishi monogatari'' and historical works ===
Works that continued the tradition of Heian ''[[rekishi monogatari]]'' such as ''[[Ōkagami]]'' and ''[[Ima Kagami]]'' were written during this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} ''[[Mizu Kagami]]'', for example, recounts the history of Japan between the reigns of [[Emperor Jinmu]] and [[Emperor Ninmyō]], based on historical works such as the ''[[Fusō Ryakuki]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}
''[[Akitsushima Monogatari]]'' (秋津島物語) attempted to recount events before Jinmu, in the [[age of the gods]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

More serious historical works composed during this period include the ''[[Gukanshō]]'', which describes the period between Emperor Jinmu and [[Emperor Juntoku]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} It also attempted to describe the reasons for historical events and the lessons to be learned from them, and unlike the historical romances being produced at court that reflected nostalgically on the past, the ''Gukanshō'' used history as a way to criticize present society and provide guidance for the future.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} It is also noteworthy for its simple, direct language, which was a new innovation of this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

=== Early medieval ''gunki monogatari'' ===
The historical and court romances were a continuation of the works of the Heian period, but a new genre that built upon the foundations laid by these emerged in the Kamakura period: the ''[[gunki monogatari]]'', which is also known as simply ''gunki'', or ''senki monogatari''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} The immediate predecessors of these works were ''[[kanbun]]'' chronicles composed in the Heian era such as the ''{{illm|Shōmonki|ja|将門記}}'' and ''{{illm|Mutsu Waki|ja|陸奥話記}}'', as well as warrior tales included in the ''[[Konjaku Monogatari-shū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

The ''gunki monogatari'' emerged in the early medieval era as a form of popular entertainment, with the most important early works being the ''[[Hōgen Monogatari]]'', the ''[[Heiji Monogatari]]'', and ''The Tale of the Heike''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} These three recounted, in order, the three major conflicts that led to the rise of the warrior class at the end of the Heian period. They were composed in ''[[wakan konkō-bun]]'', a form of literary Japanese that combined the ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'' of the court romances with Chinese elements, and described fierce battles in the style of [[epic poetry]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} They portrayed strong characters proactively and forcefully, in a manner that Ichiko notes was appropriate for the age of the warrior class's ascendancy.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} The ''Heike'' in particular was widely recited by ''[[biwa-hōshi]]'', travelling monks, usually blind, who recited the tale to the accompaniment of the ''[[biwa]]'', and this was a very popular form of entertainment throughout the country all through the middle ages.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

The authors of these works are largely unknown, but they were frequently adapted to meet the tastes of their audiences, with court literati, Buddhist hermits, and artists of the lower classes all likely having a hand in their formation.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} There are, consequently, a very large number of variant texts.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} In addition to the largely unprecedented manner in which these works were formed, they led to the rise of ''{{illm|heikyoku|ja|平曲}}'' style of musical accompaniment.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

Following these three, the ''{{illm|Jōkyū-ki|ja|承久記}}'', which recounted the events of the Jōkyū rebellion, was also compiled.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Together, the four are known as the ''Shibu Gassen-jō'' (四部合戦状).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} The ''[[Soga Monogatari]]'', which composed toward the end of this period, placed its focus on heroic figures, and laid the foundations for the ''gunki monogatari'' of the Muromachi period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

Some ''gunki monogatari'' in this period took the form of picture scrolls.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

=== Early medieval ''setsuwa'' literature ===
Similarly to new the innovations in the collection and categorization of ''waka'' poetry in the Kamakura period, the period saw an upswing in the compilation and editing of ''[[setsuwa]]'', or short tales and parables.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} This included aristocratic collections such as the ''[[Kokon Chomonjū]]'', the ''[[Kojidan]]'' and the ''{{illm|Ima Monogatari|ja|今物語}}'', as well as the ''[[Uji Shūi Monogatari]]'', which also incorporates stories of commoners.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Other works targeted at members of the newly ascendant warrior class had a stronger emphasis on disciplined learning and [[Confucianism]], as exemplified in the ''{{illm|Jikkinshō|ja|十訓抄}}''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

Buddhist ''setsuwa'' works were meant to provide resources for sermons, and these included the ''{{illm|Hōbutsu-shū|ja|宝物集}}'' of {{illm|Taira no Yasuyori|ja|平康頼}} and Kamo no Chōmei's ''{{illm|Hosshin-shū|ja|発心集}}'', the ''{{illm|Senjū-shō|ja|撰集抄}}'' and ''[[Shiju Hyakuin Nenshū]]'' (私聚百因縁集).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} Of particular note are the works of monk and compiler [[Mujū Dōgyō]], such as ''[[Shaseki-shū]]'' and ''[[Zōdan-shū]]'' (雑談集), which mix fascinating anecdotes of everyday individuals in with Buddhist sermons.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

These ''setsuwa'' collections, like those of earlier eras, compile tales of Buddhist miracles and the nobility, but works like the ''{{illm|Kara Monogatari|ja|唐物語}}'' also incorporate tales and anecdotes from [[China]], and some include tales of commoners, showing a change in tastes in this new era.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

Some works describe the origins of [[Buddhist temple]]s and [[Shinto shrine]]s and collect tales of miracles.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1pp=259–260}} Such works include the ''[[Kasuga Gongen Genki]]'' and the ''{{illm|Kokawa-dera Engi|ja|粉河寺縁起絵巻}}'', both of which are ''emakimono'' that combine words and images.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}} These are a development of the earlier ''[[engi (literature)|engi]]'' that were written in ''kanbun'', but Ichiko notes that they should also be considered a form of ''setsuwa''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=259}}

=== Early medieval diaries, travel literature and essays ===
Ladies at court continued to write [[nikki bungaku|diaries]] as they had during the Heian period, with important examples including ''{{illm|Nakatsukasa no Naishi Nikki|ja|中務内侍日記}}'' and ''{{illm|Ben no Naishi Nikki|ja|弁内侍日記}}''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Of particular interest are diaries written by women who became ''{{illm|nyoin|ja|女院}}'' (court ladies) during the [[Taira clan|Taira]] ascendancy such as ''{{illm|Kenshun-mon'in Chūnagon Nikki|ja|建春門院中納言日記}}'' and ''{{illm|Kenrei-mon'in Ukyō no Daibu Shū|ja|建礼門院右京大夫集}}'', which provide a glimpse of life behind the scenes at the palace.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}
The latter in particular, written by [[Kenrei-mon'in Ukyō no Daibu]] had come to court to serve [[Kenrei-mon'in]], is focused primarily on poetry that conveys her sadness and lamentation, following the downfall of the Taira clan in warfare, which shows a character quite different from the ladies' diaries of the Heian period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} ''[[Towazu-gatari]]'', a work by [[Go-Fukakusain no Nijō]], combines reflections on her time serving at court with a travelogue.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} It provides a bare-faced look at the inner thoughts and desires of its author, which is rare for a work written by a woman of this period, causing Ichiko to compare it to the [[I novel]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Literary diaries written in Japanese by men, such as [[Asukai Masaari]]'s ''[[Haru no Miyamaji]]'' (はるのみやまぢ, also known as 飛鳥井雅有日記 ''Asukai Masaari Nikki'') began to appear.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} The tradition continued of ''[[kanbun-nikki]]'' (diaries in [[classical Chinese]]) used to record the day-to-day lives of the nobility also continued, of which Teika's ''[[Meigetsuki]]'' is the best-known example.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Because of the biregional nature of government in this period, with the court in Kyoto and the shogunate in Kamakura, works describing the journey along the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] between Kyoto and Kamakura, such as ''{{illm|Kaidōki|ja|海道記}}'', ''{{illm|Tōkan Kikō|ja|東関紀行}}'', and the nun [[Abutsu]]'s ''{{illm|Izayoi Nikki|ja|六十夜日記}}'' began to appear ''en masse''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} ''Kaidōki'' and ''Tōkan Kikō'' were written by highly educated men in ''wakan konkō-bun''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

''[[Takakura-in Itsukushima Gokōki]]'' (高倉院厳島御幸記) is one important example of the growing subgenre of travelogues describing pilgrimages to shrines and temples.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} ''[[Ryūben Hōin Saijōki]]'' (隆弁法印西上記) recounts the [[Tsurugaoka Hachimangū]] ''[[bettō]]'' {{illm|Ryūben|ja|隆弁}}'s journey to [[Onjō-ji]] and the time he spent there.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} It was likely composed by one of Ryūben's travelling companions, and is noteworthy partly for its unusual gaps in describing the journey, and for its frank portrayal of the perversity&lt;!-- "狂態や稚児との愛欲" --&gt; of the monks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Works discussing the rejection of the material world, beginning with [[Saigyō]] at the end of the previous era, continued to be composed in the Kamakura period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} These works combined poetry describing the recluse life in thatched-hut retreats with magnificent essays called ''[[zuihitsu]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} The most important examples are Kamo no Chōmei's ''[[Hōjōki]]'' and [[Kenkō]]'s ''[[Tsurezuregusa]]'' which was written around the very end of the Kamakura period and the beginning of the Nanbokuchō period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} The former describes its author's journey toward giving up the world, social changes, and celebrates recluse life, while the latter is a work of instruction detailing its author's inner thoughts and feelings as he lives in quiet seclusion.
{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}
Along with the classical ''[[Pillow Book]]'', they are considered the archetypal Japanese ''zuihitsu''{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

=== Buddhist literature and songs ===
The ''zuihitsu'' described above, written by monks training by living secluded lives in the wilderness, are of course a form of Buddhist literature, but it goes without saying that the most important specifically ''Buddhist'' literature consists of the writings of great monks of the various Japanese [[schools of Buddhism#Mahāyāna schools|Buddhist sects]] and the collections of their sayings that were produced by their followers.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} These include:
*[[Dōgen]]'s ''{{illm|Shōbō Genzō|ja|正法眼蔵}}'' and ''{{illm|Shōbō Genzō Zuimonki|ja|正法眼蔵随聞記}}'', the latter of which was recorded by his disciple&lt;!-- "disciples"? --&gt;;{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}
*''Mattōshō'' (末灯鈔), which collected the writings of [[Shinran]], and ''[[Tannishō]]'', a compilation of his teachings;{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}
*[[Nichiren]]'s ''{{illm|Kaimokushō|ja|開目抄}}'' and other works.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Many of these Buddhist writings, or ''hōgo'', expound on deep philosophical principles, or explain the basics of Buddhism in a simple manner that could easily be digested by the uneducated masses.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

In addition to the continued production of ''{{illm|imayō|ja|今様}}'', ''[[sōka (song)|sōka]]'' (早歌) were created in large numbers, and their lyrics survive in textual form.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Buddhist songs were performed as part of ''{{illm|ennen|ja|延年}}'', etc., and of particular note is the ''{{illm|wasan|ja|和讃}}'' form.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Many of these ''wasan'' were supposedly created by Buddhist masters of the Heian period, but the form became prominent in the Kamakura period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} These songs were composed with the goal of educating people about Buddhism, and were widely recited around the country.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Ichiko notes that the songs themselves are moving, but notes that Shinran's ''{{illm|Sanjō Wasan|ja|三帖和讃}}'' and later songs were particularly brilliant works of Buddhist literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Furthermore, ''engi'' associated with famous temples, and illustrated biographies of Japanese Buddhist saints such as ''[[Kōya-daishi Gyōjō Zue]]'' (高野大師行状図絵), ''[[Hōnen-shōnin Eden]]'' (法然上人絵伝), ''[[Shinran-shōnin Eden]]'' (親鸞上人絵伝), ''{{illm|Ippen-shōnin Eden|ja|一遍聖絵}}'', continued to be produced during the Kamakura period and well into the Nanbokuchō period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Ichiko notes that these should also be considered examples of the Buddhist literature of this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

== Literature of the late medieval period ==
=== Historical background of the late medieval period ===
The late medieval period covers the roughly 270 years that, by conventional Japanese historiography, are classified as the Nanbokuchō (1333–1392), Muromachi (1392–1573) and Azuchi–Momoyama (1573–1600) periods.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} The conflict between the northern and southern courts in the Nanbokuchō period, and the frequent civil wars in the Muromachi period, caused massive social upheaval in this period, with the nobility (who were already in decline) losing virtually all of their former prestige, and lower classes moving upward to take their place.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} In particular, the high-level members of the warrior class took over from the aristocracy as the custodians of culture.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

The literature of this period was created by nobles, warriors, and hermits and artists of the lower classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} The popular literature and entertainment, which had previously been of little consequence, came into the limelight during this time.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} The ''[[Noh]]'' theatre came under the protection and sponsorship of the warrior class, with [[Kan'ami]] and his son [[Zeami]] bringing it to new artistic heights, while [[Nijō Yoshimoto]] and lower-class ''renga'' (linked verse) masters formalized and popularized that form.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

This is the point when "ancient" literature came to an end and was replaced with literature more representative of the early modern period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} This results in some degree of schizophrenia in the literature of this period, as contradictory elements are mixed freely.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Deep and serious literature was combined with light and humorous elements, which is a noteworthy characteristic of late medieval literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} ''Noh'' and its comic counterpart ''[[kyōgen]]'' is the standard example of this phenomenon, but ''renga'' had ''[[haikai]]'', ''waka'' had its ''[[kyōka]]'' and ''[[kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'' (poetry in [[Classical Chinese]]) had its ''[[kyōshi]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} ''[[Monogatari-zōshi]]'' composed during this period combined the ''[[mono no aware|aware]]'' of the serious ''monogatari'' with characteristics of humorous anecdotes.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Literature characterized by ''wabi-sabi'' was valued during this period of chaotic warfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Commentary on and collation of the classics also came to the fore, with the "hidden traditions" of ''[[Kokinshū]]'' interpretation (''{{illm|kokin-denju|ja|古今伝授}}'') beginning.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Furthermore, it was during this period that the classical Japanese literary tradition ceased to be the exclusive prerogative of the aristocracy, and passed into the hands of scholarly-minded warriors and hermits.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} [[Ichijō Kaneyoshi]] and {{illm|Sanjōnishi Sanetaka|ja|三条西実隆}} were noteworthy scholars of aristocratic origins, and in addition to writing commentaries such aristocratic scholars examined and compared a large volume of manuscripts.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} This opening up to the general populace of classical literature was also advanced by hermit ''renga'' masters such as [[Sōgi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

Ichiko notes that while this reverence for the literature of the past was important, it is also a highly noteworthy characteristic of this period that new genres and forms, unlike those of earlier eras, prevailed.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} He also emphasizes that even though this was a period of bloody warfare and tragedy, the literature is often lively and bright, a trend that continued into the early modern period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}}

=== Literature in Chinese ===
Classical Chinese (''kanbun'') literature of the Heian period had been the domain of aristocratic men, but as the aristocracy fell from prominence writing in Chinese became more closely associated with [[Zen Buddhist]] monks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=260}} Zen monks travelling back and forth between Japan and [[China]] brought with them the writings of [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] China, and writing in Chinese by Japanese authors experienced something of a renaissance.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1pp=260–261}}

The Chinese literature produced during this period is known as the [[literature of the Five Mountains]] because of its close association with the monks of the [[Five Mountain System]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} The founder of the lineage was [[Yishan Yining]] (''Issan Ichinei'' in Japanese), an immigrant from Yuan China, and his disciples included [[Kokan Shiren]], [[Sesson Yūbai]], [[Musō Soseki]] and others, and these monks planted the seeds of the Five Mountains literary tradition.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Kokan's ''{{illm|Genkō Shakusho|ja|元亨釈書}}'' is an important work of this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Ichiko remarks that while [[Chūgan Engetsu]] also created excellent writings at this time, it was Musō's disciples [[Gidō Shūshin]] and {{illm|Zekkai Chūshin|ja|絶海中津}} who brought the literature of the Five Mountains to its zenith.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

Musō and Gidō in particular had the ear of powerful members of the military class, to whom they acted as cultural and spiritual tutors.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} The tradition continued to flourish into the Muromachi period, when it came under the protection of the shogunate, but this led to its developing a tendency toward sycophancy, and while there continued to be exceptional individuals like [[Ikkyū Sōjun]], this period showed a general tendency toward stagnation and degradation.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Nevertheless, Ichiko notes, the literature of the Five Mountains had a profound impact on the cultural and artistic development of the Nanbokuchō period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

=== Late medieval ''waka'' ===
Four imperial anthologies were compiled during the Nanbokuchō period: three by the Nijō school and one, the ''[[Fūga Wakashū]]'', by the Kyōgoku school.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} The latter was directly compiled by [[Emperor Kōgon|retired emperor Kōgon]], and has the second gretest number of Kyōgoku poems after the ''Gyokuyō Wakashū''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} The ''[[Shin'yō Wakashū]]'', a quasi-''chokusenshū'' compiled by [[Prince Munenaga]], collects the works of the emperors and retainers of the Southern Court.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

In the Muromachi period, the ''waka'' composed by the nobility continued to stagnate, and after {{illm|Asukai Masayo|ja|飛鳥井雅世}} compiled the ''[[Shinshoku-kokin Wakashū]]'', the twenty-first imperial anthology, the age of court ''waka'' was at its end.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

The most important ''waka'' poets of this period were not courtiers but monks, hermits, and warriors. Examples of prominent monk-poets are the Nijō poet [[Ton'a]] in the Nanbokuchō period and [[Shōtetsu]] (who wrote the book of poetic theory ''{{illm|Shōtetsu Monogatari|ja|正徹物語}}'') and {{illm|Shinkei|ja|心敬}} (who was also a noted ''renga'' master) in the Muromachi period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Important ''waka'' poets of the samurai class include [[Imagawa Ryōshun]] in the early period, {{illm|Tō Tsuneyori|ja|東常縁}} (said to be the founder of the ''kokin-denju'' tradition) and others toward the middle of this period, and [[Hosokawa Yūsai]] at the very end of the middle ages.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Yūsai carried the ''waka'' tradition on into the early modern period, an act whose significance, Ichiko notes, should not be underestimated.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

=== ''Renga'' ===
Linked verse, or ''renga'', took the place of ''waka'' as the dominant poetic form during this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} ''Renga'', or more specifically ''chō-renga'' (長連歌), emphasized wit and change, and was practiced in earlier times by both the nobility and commoners, but during the Nanbokuchō period Nijō Yoshimoto organized gatherings of both nobles and commoners and with the assistance of hermits like {{illm|Kyūsei|ja|救済 (連歌師)}} was able to formalize the ''renga'' tradition and compile the first true ''renga'' anthology, the ''[[Tsukuba-shū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Yoshimoto also composed important books of ''renga'' theory such as ''[[Renri Hishō]]'' and ''[[Tsukuba Mondō]]'' (筑波問答).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

Later came notable poets like {{illm|Bontōan|ja|梵灯庵}}, but ''renga'' went into a brief period of stagnation until the [[Eikyō]] era (1429–1441), when the favour of the shōgun [[Ashikaga Yoshinori]] led to its being rejuvenated.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} The [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (renga)|Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]] (竹林の七賢), including such masters as {{illm|Sōzei|ja|宗砌}} and Shinkei were at their height during this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Shinkei, who was also a prominent ''waka'' poet, wrote works of ''waka'' and ''renga'' theory such as ''[[Sasame-goto]]'' and ''[[Hitori-goto]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Sōgi, who was active from roughly the time of the Ōnin War, built on these developments and helped ''renga'' to reach its highest point.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} With {{illm|Kensai|ja|猪苗代兼載}} he compiled the ''[[Shinsen Tsukuba-shū]]'', and with his disciples {{illm|Shōhaku|ja|肖柏}} and {{illm|Sōchō|ja|宗長}} create ''renga'' masterpieces such as ''[[Minase Sangin Nannin Hyakuin]]'' (水無瀬三吟何人百韻) and ''[[Yuyama Sangin]]'' (湯山三吟).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

Sōgi's disciples Sōchō, [[Sōseki (renga poet)|Sōseki]] &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:宗碩|ja]])&lt;/small&gt;, {{illm|Sōboku|ja|宗牧}} and other's carried on his legacy, teaching others and continuing the glory days of the genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} The most important ''renga'' master of the end of this period was {{illm|Satomura Jōha|ja|里村紹巴}}, who wrote ''[[Renga Shihō-shō]]'' (連歌至宝抄).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} He continued the practice of expanding ''renga'' to the masses, with his family (the [[Satomura clan]]) continuing to play a central role in the ''renga'' world into the Edo period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Under his influence, ''renga'' became fixed, causing it to stagnate, and leading to the increased popularity of ''[[haikai no renga]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

''Haikai'' had been popular even in the golden age of ''renga'', but went on the rise beginning with ''[[Chikuba Kyōgin-shū]]'' (竹馬狂吟集), the [[Ise Shrine|Ise]] priest [[Arakida Moritake]]'s ''[[Haikai no Renga Dokugin Senku]]'' (俳諧之連歌独吟千句, also known as ''Moritake Senku'' 守武千句) and [[Yamazaki Sōkan]]'s ''{{illm|Inu Tsukuba-shū|ja|新撰犬筑波集}}'' (''Haikai Renga-shō'' 俳諧連歌抄) in the late Muromachi period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} ''Haikai'' developed from ''renga'' at roughly the same time as ''kyōka'' developed from ''waka''.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Ichiko notes that while some ''haikai'' ventured too far into absurdity, they tapped into the popular spirit of the Japanese masses, and laid the groundwork for the major developments of the form in the early modern period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

=== ''Monogatari-zōshi'' ===
The ''giko-monogatari'' of the earlier period largely ceased during the Nanbokuchō period, and an incredibly large number of shorter works known as ''monogatari-zōshi'' (more commonly called ''[[otogi-zōshi]]'', a name that was applied later&lt;!-- maybe?? --&gt;) were created.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Many of them are unsophisticated and childish, and were written for a much broader audience than the earlier tale literature, which had been written by and for the aristocracy exclusively.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} As a result, they cover a much broader range of topics, and were written not only by nobles but by warriors, monks, hermits and urbanites.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

Of the works that continued the courtly tradition, some (such as ''[[Wakakusa Monogatari]]'') told romantic love stories and some (such as ''[[Iwaya no Sōshi]]'') contained stories of unfortunate&lt;!-- ? --&gt; stepchildren.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Among those about members of the warrior class, some (such as ''[[Shutendōji (otogi-zōshi)|Shutendōji]]'') drew upon ''gunki monogatari'' and heroic legends of monster-slayers, some (such as ''[[Onzōshi Shima-watari]]'') built legends of warriors, and others (such as ''[[Muramachi Monogatari]]'' and ''[[Akimichi]]'') told of chaos between rival houses and revenge.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} A very large number of them are about religious themes, reflecting the rise of popular Buddhism during this period.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Some of these works (such as ''[[Aki no Yo no Naga Monogatari]]'') described monastic life, some (such as ''[[Sannin Hōshi]]'') expounded the virtues of seclusion, some (such as ''[[Kumano no Honji]]'') elaborate on the origins of temples and shrines in light of the concept of ''[[honji suijaku]]'', and some (such as ''[[Eshin-sōzu Monogatari]]'') are biographies of Buddhist saints.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

In addition to the above works about nobles, warriors and monks, there are also a number of works in which the protagonists are farmers and urban commoners, known as ''risshin-shusse mono'' (立身出世物, "tales of rising up in the world") and ''shūgi-mono'' (祝儀物).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Examples of the former include ''[[Bunshō-zōshi]]'' (文正草子) and examples of the latter include ''[[Tsuru-Kame Monogatari]]'' (鶴亀物語).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} A number of these works are based on popular folk-tales, and reflect themes of ''[[gekokujō]]'' and the lively activity of the lower classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}} Several feature settings outside Japan, including the ''engi-mono'' of the early period and such works as ''[[Nijūshi-kō (otogi-zōshi)|Nijūshi-kō]] (二十四孝) and ''[[Hōman-chōja]]'' (宝満長者).{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=261}}

=== ''Kirishitan'' literature ===
For almost a century after the arrival of [[Francis Xavier]] in [[Kagoshima]] in [[Tenbun|Tenbun 18]] (1549), [[Jesuit]] missionaries actively sought converts among the Japanese, and the literature these missionaries and [[Kirishitan|Japanese Christian]] communities produced is known as [[Kirishitan Nanban literature|''Kirishitan Nanban'' literature]] (キリシタン南蛮文学 ''kirishitan-nanban bungaku'').{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=263}} This includes both translations of European literature and Christian religious literature produced in Japan.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=263}} The [[Amakusa-bon|Amakusa edition]] of ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' (天草本平家物語 ''Amakusa-bon Heike Monogatari''), which translated the work into the vernacular Japanese of the sixteenth century and represented it entirely in [[rōma-ji|romanized Japanese]] was printed in [[Bunroku|Bunroku 1]] (1592), and the following year saw the printing of the ''[[Isoho Monogatari]]'' (伊曾保物語), a translation into vernacular Japanese of [[Aesop's Fables]] that was similar printed entirely in romanized Japanese.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=263}}

The Jesuits also published linguistic works such as the Portuguese-Japanese dictionary ''[[Vocabulário da Língua do Japão]]'' and [[João Rodrigues Tçuzu|João Rodrigues]]'s ''[[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam]]'', which were originally produced to assist in proselytizing activities, but have become important resources for [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[historical linguistics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=263}} Other works included ''[[Dochirina Kirishitan]]'', a Japanese edition of ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' that has been noted for its simple, clear and direct use of the Japanese vernacular.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=263}}

Ichiko notes that these works, which were all produced in the Azuchi–Momoyama and very early Edo periods, did not have a significant influence on medieval Japanese literature, but are nonetheless an important part of the history of Japanese thought at the end of the middle ages.{{sfnm|1a1=Ichiko|1y=1983|1p=263}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8223">The '''[[music industry]] of [[East Asia]],''' a region that includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea and Taiwan is a rapidly growing [[economic sector]] that is home to some of the world's largest music markets.

== Milestones ==
[[File:Map_of_East_Asia.png|thumb|312x312px|Modern East Asia]]

In 2003, [[South Korea]] became the world's first music market where digital music sales surpassed those of physical formats.&lt;ref name="8thlargest"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marchand|first=Ruby|title=Trade Mission Engages Key Korean Music Professionals|url=http://www.grammy.com/blogs/trade-mission-engages-key-korean-music-professionals|publisher=[[Grammy Award]]|accessdate=2013-01-14|quote=...It's also the first country where digital surpassed physical sales.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClure|first=Steve|title=Billboard Vol. 118, No. 18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|publisher=Billboard|year=2006|issn=0006-2510|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Japan]] surpassed the [[United States]] as the world's largest recorded music market for the first time, according to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]. Though the U.S. remained the largest if licensing fees are included into the figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan surpasses US as world's biggest recorded music market|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/tech-biz/04/09/13/japan-surpasses-us-worlds-biggest-recorded-music-market|author=[[Kyodo News]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News Channel]]|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following year, Japan fell back to the second-largest music market after experiencing a 16.7 per cent decrease due to the country's reliance of CDs and slow adoption of digital services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan drags down global music market|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26626396|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303287804579447222439275740|title=Japan Hits a Sour Note on Music Sales|author1=Karp, Hannah|author2=Inada, Miho|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the digital music market in [[China]] is expected to be worth {{USD|2.1 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/china-streaming-music-baidu-alibaba-battle/|title=Already bigger than Spotify, China’s search engine giant doubles down on streaming music|author=Steven Millward|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 4, 2015|work=Tech In Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is expected to become one of the largest music markets in the world by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2015-12/21/content_22763869.htm|title=Music industry dreaming of China streaming|author=Chen Nan|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2016|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrast with the global music industry ==
Although global physical music sales (such as CDs) have been declining in recent years, in [[East Asia]] (particularly [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]), however, physical music sales have been rising consistently.&lt;ref name="ifpi" /&gt;

The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] credits this phenomenon to "[[K-Pop]] fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets".&lt;ref name="ifpi"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1549940/francis-keeling-universal-musics-global-head-of-digital|title= Francis Keeling, Universal Music’s Global Head of Digital Business: Google Streaming Service ‘Is the Biggest Funnel We Can Have’|accessdate= 7 May 2013|publisher=''[[Billboard magazine]]''|quote=According to IFPI, global physical format sales declined from 61% in 2011 to an estimated 58% in 2012. However, in Japan, CD and DVD sales posted strong increases (sales numbers or percentages were not provided). While in South Korea physical sales are expected to rise for the third consecutive year, with IFPI crediting K-Pop fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets, with driving the format's sustained popularity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a music executive from [[Universal Music Group]], CDs are becoming "the new merchandise in Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindvall|first=Helienne|title=How K-Pop &amp; J-Pop Are Saving Physical Music Sales|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|publisher=Digital Music News|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518191654/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|archivedate=18 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Several controversies have arrived based on the way the industry has been treating its artists.

=== Control of artists personal lives ===
It is not uncommon for record labels to prohibit their pop artists from dating for a certain period of time or for as long as they have a contract with the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/3-ways-the-japanese-entertainment-industry-keeps-idol-singers-from-dating|title=3 ways the Japanese entertainment industry keeps idol singers from dating|work=Japan Today|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan managers may attempt to discourage their artists from dating or engaging in behavior that may tarnish their images by keeping a busy schedule and only letting artists know about their schedules a day at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artists who break this contract, as in the case of [[Minami Minegishi]] from [[AKB48]], run the risk of getting dropped from their music group or contract.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35368705|title=The dark side of Asia’s pop music industry|last=Oi|first=Mariko|date=2016|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea has similar rules for musical pop artists. Artists have more freedom to date and get married, however managers have strong control over their personal lives and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Taiwan, artists are also expected to behave in certain ways, as they cannot discuss taboo topics such as politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Mysore literature in Kannada''' is a body of literature composed in the [[Kannada language]] in the historical [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in [[Southern India]] and  written in the [[Kannada script]]. The writings date from the Kingdom of Mysore, which existed from around 1600 CE until the establishment of modern India in 1947. Many of the works of this literature written on religious themes are labeled [[Veerashaiva]] or [[Vaishnava]] in acknowledgment of the two faiths that gave form to the literature and fostered it until the advent of the [[Modern Kannada literature|modern era]].&lt;ref name="oldest10"/&gt; Despite a gradual decline in the popularity of [[Jainism]], authors devoted to the faith produced some works of merit.&lt;ref name="oldest10"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 17, Shastri (1955), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Secular themes dealing with a wide range of subjects were also written on.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 23–26; Kamath (2001), p. 228, 280; Pranesh (2003), pp. 11, 60; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Kannada literature flourished for a short while in the court of the neighbouring kingdom of the [[Keladi Nayaka|Nayakas]] of [[Keladi]] whose territory was annexed by Mysore in 1763.&lt;ref name="keladinayaka"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), pp. 370, 377&lt;/ref&gt;

During an age of revival and innovation, some Mysore court poets brought back the classical ''[[champu]]'' (a composition in prose-verse), a form of writing that had prevailed in Kannada prior to the 13th century, and initiated writings on contemporary history.&lt;ref name="ship"&gt;Shipley (2007), pp. 526, 528&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakshagana]], a native form of dramatic literature meant for a rustic audience, consolidated in the coastal and [[malnad]] (hill) regions in the 16th century and gained popularity thereafter, and spread to Mysore and [[Yelandur]].&lt;ref name="sabha10"&gt;Ashton (2003), p. 22; Brandon and Banham (1993), p. 115; Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; The literature of the itinerant [[Haridasa]]s, popular in the 15th and 16th century, was revived in the 18th and 19th century, and had a strong influence on devotionalism in the Kannada speaking regions.&lt;ref name="flourish"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 200&amp;ndash;201; Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 884; Thielemann (2002), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[vachana]]'' poetic tradition was repopularised by some poets while others wrote anthologies and doctrines based on the 12th century Veerashaiva canon.&lt;ref name="repopularise"&gt;Shipley (2007), p. 528; Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 188&amp;ndash;192; Nagaraj (2003) p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Social developments in the 19th century brought the influence of [[English literature]] and classical [[Sanskrit literature]], resulting in the birth of modern prose, prose narrative and theatrical literature.&lt;ref name="murthy"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 167&amp;ndash;170&lt;/ref&gt;

The men of letters in the Mysore royal court included not only the court poets, who were often quite prolific, but also on occasion the rulers themselves.&lt;ref name="kan6"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78; Shipley (2007), p. 528; Kamath (2001), pp. 227, 229&amp;ndash;230; Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 23, 26; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90; Pranesh (2003), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the post [[Vijayanagara empire|Vijayanagara]] period, a new kind of lyrical poetry, one unaffiliated with the royal court, and written by maverick-poets was gaining popularity.&lt;ref name="folk"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), pp. 378&amp;ndash;379&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of [[Meter (poetry)|metres]], indigenous and Sanskritic, were popular including ''tripadi'' (3-line verse), ''shatpadi'' (6-line verse) and ''saptapadi'' (7-line verse) metres, and ''gadya'' (prose).&lt;ref name="meteres"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90; Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 192, 210; Pranesh (2003), pp. 21, 32, 42–43, 49&amp;ndash;50, 87&amp;ndash;88; Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1764&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-16th century, Kannada literature had been influenced by three important socio-religious developments: [[Jainism]] (9th&amp;ndash;12th centuries), [[Veerashaivism]] (devotion to the god Shiva, from the 12th century), and [[Vaishnavism]] (devotion to the god Vishnu, from the 15th century).&lt;ref name="models"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 17, 65&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhakti"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 167&amp;ndash;170, 192&amp;ndash;195&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, writings on secular subjects remained popular throughout this period.&lt;ref name="topics"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 61&amp;ndash;64&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain works were written in the classical ''champu'' metre and were centred on the lives of [[Tirthankar]]s (saints), princes and personages associated with the [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="champu"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 17, 61&lt;/ref&gt; The early Veerashaiva literature (1150&amp;ndash;1200 CE), comprising pithy poems called ''Vachanas'' (''lit.'' "utterance" or "saying")&lt;ref name="favour1"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp. 360&amp;ndash;361; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="favour10"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 115; Nagaraj in Pollock (2003), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; which propagated devotion to the god Shiva were written mostly as  prose-poems, and to a lesser extent in the ''tripadi'' metre.&lt;ref name="3line"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 59; Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3line1"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 163&amp;ndash;164, 166&amp;ndash;169, 191&lt;/ref&gt; From the 13th century, Veerashaiva writers made the saints of the 12th century the protagonists of their writings and established native metres such as the ''ragale'' (lyrical compositions in blank verse) and  the ''shatpadi''.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 362; Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragale"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 551&amp;ndash;552, pp. 403&amp;ndash;404; Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 179&amp;ndash;205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harishchandra"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 1181&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaishnava writers of the 15th and early 16th century [[Vijayanagara empire]] consisted of the [[Brahmin]] commentators who wrote under royal patronage, and the itinerant [[Haridasa]]s, saint-poets who spread the philosophy of [[Madhvacharya]] using simple Kannada in the form of melodious songs.&lt;ref name="thimmanna"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhaktimusic"&gt;Sharma (1961), pp. 514&amp;ndash;555&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="music1"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 194&amp;ndash;200&lt;/ref&gt; The Haridasa poets used genres such as the ''kirthane'' (compositions based on rhythm and melody), the ''suladi'' (rhythm-based) and the ''ugabhoga'' (melody-based).&lt;ref name="ugabhoha"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 166&amp;ndash;167, 193&amp;ndash;194&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Kannada writings had changed from ''marga'' (formal) to ''desi'' (vernacular) and become more accessible to the commoner.&lt;ref name="gamut"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 163&amp;ndash;164, 166&amp;ndash;167&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments from 16th century ==

=== Court and monastic literature ===
After the decline of the [[Vijayanagara empire]], the centres of Kannada literary production shifted to the courts of the emerging independent states, at Mysore and [[Keladi]].&lt;ref name="keladi"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 370, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Keladi was centred at Keladi and nearby [[Ikkeri]] in the modern [[Shivamogga district]]. At their peak, their domains included the coastal, hill and some interior regions of modern [[Karnataka]]. Writers in the Keladi court authored important works on Veerashaiva doctrine. The Keladi territories and that of smaller chiefs (''Palegars'') were eventually absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore by 1763.&lt;ref name="absorb"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 220, pp. 225&amp;ndash;226; Nagaraj (2003), p. 370; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The unique aspect of the Mysore court was the presence of numerous multi-lingual writers, some of whom were Veerashaivas. They were often adept in Telugu and Sanskrit, in addition to Kannada. The Veerashaiva monasteries that had sprung up in various regions including [[Mysore]], [[Tumkur]], [[Chitradurga]] and [[Bangalore]] sought to spread their influence beyond the Kannada speaking borders.&lt;ref name="border"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), pp. 377&amp;ndash;378&lt;/ref&gt; Sadakshara Deva, a Veerashaiva writer, tried to rejuvenate the classical ''champu'' style of writing.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; The [[Srivaishnavism|Srivaishnava]] (a sect of Vaishnavism) writers, who were dominant in the Mysore court, maintained a literary style that was conventional and conservative while proliferating lore and legend. A spurt in Vaishnava writings resulted in new renderings of the epics, the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]] and no fewer than three versions of the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name="rendering"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 91&amp;ndash;92&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 17th century, information about royal genealogy and achievements had been recorded mostly on versified inscriptions. Beginning with the 17th century, with the consolidation of the feudatory of Mysore into an independent kingdom, historical and biographical writings became popular. A number of such works were penned by the court poets in the 17th and early 18th century, most notably, Tirumalarya II and Chikkupdhyaya. Some of these writings would later serve as valuable research and source material for modern day historians.&lt;ref name="kantiravavijaya"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk and didactic literature===
[[File:Yakshagana artists makeup.jpg|right|thumb|Yakshagana artists applying makeup to prepare for a play]]
Yakshagana (''lit.'' "Songs of the demi-gods") is a composite folk-dance-drama or folk theatre of [[South India|southern India]] which combines literature, music, dance and painting into. The best-known forms of this art are from the [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Udupi district]], [[Uttara Kannada]] and to some extent from the [[Shimoga district]] of modern Karnataka.&lt;ref name="gana10"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gana"&gt;Ashton (2003), p. 17&amp;ndash;18, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="region"&gt;Brandon and Banham (1993), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of dance-dramas collectively termed as Yakshagana. The ''Yakshagana Tenkutittu'' (''lit.'' "Yakshagana of the southern style") is popular primarily in the [[Mangalore]] region and the ''Yakshagana Badagatittu Bayalaata'' (''lit.'' "Yakshagana of northern style performed outdoors") is popular in [[Udupi]] and surrounding regions.&lt;ref name="kau"&gt;Ashton (2003), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Other art forms also grouped under Yakshagana are the ''Nagamandalam'', a dance meant to appease the deity [[Nāga|Naga]], and a variety of ''bhuta'' (spirit) dances.&lt;ref name="gana"/&gt; The "Yakshagana Tenkutittu" is more akin to the classical [[Kathakali]] of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="gana"/&gt;

According to modern Kannada writer [[Shivarama Karanth]], the region between Udupi and [[Ikkeri]] could be where the Yakshagana of the northern style originated.&lt;ref name="vij"&gt;Karanth in Ashton (2003), pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; However, he noted that the earliest forms of dance-drama, called the ''Gandharagrama'', are mentioned in the writing ''Narada Siska'' dated to 600&amp;ndash;200 BCE. This primitive form developed into "Ekkalagana", a term which appears in the 12th century Kannada writings ''Mallinathapurana'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1105, by Nagachandra) and the ''Chandraprabha Purana'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1189, by Aggala&lt;ref name="agga"&gt;Rice E. P. (1921), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ekkala"&gt;Karanth in Ashton (2003), pp. 20&amp;ndash;21&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholar M.M. Bhat, ''Chattana'', a native composition adaptable to singing and  mentioned in  ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;850) could be considered the earliest known forerunner of the Kannada Yakshaganas.&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;Bhat (''Yakshagana-Stage in Karnataka'', 1963) in Ashton (2003), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of c.&amp;nbsp;1565 from [[Bellary]] describes a grant to a troupe of [[Tala-Maddale]] performers. The earliest available manuscript containing Yakshagana plays is ''Virata Parva'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1565) by Vishnu of Brahmavara in South Kanara, and ''Sugriva Vijaya'' (mid-16th century) by Kandukuru Rudrakavi. The earliest available edition of Yakshagana plays, ''Sabhaparva'', is dated to c.&amp;nbsp;1621.&lt;ref name="sabha"&gt;Ashton (2003), pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sugriva"&gt;Brandon and Banham (1993), p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Haridasa ''Sahitya'', the devotional literature of the Vaishnava saints of Karnataka, flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries under the guidance of such saint-poets as [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Purandara Dasa]] ("father of carnatic music")&lt;ref name="similar"/&gt; and [[Kanaka Dasa]]. This period, according to the scholars M.V. Kamath and V.B. Kher, may be called its "classical period". This literature was revived in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;Kamath and Kher (2000), pp. 60&amp;ndash;61&lt;/ref&gt; According to musicologist Selina Tielemann, the Vaishnava ''bhakti'' (devotion) movement, which started with the 6th century [[Alvars]] of modern Tamil Nadu and spread northwards, reached its peak influence on [[South India]]n devotionalism with the advent of the Haridasas of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="peakinfluence"&gt;Thielemann (2002), pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; The Haridasa poetry, which bears some structural similarities to devotional songs of northern and eastern India, is preserved in written textual form but the musical compositions in which they are rendered have been passed down orally. These songs have remained popular with the members of the Madhva religious order even in the modern age.&lt;ref name="similar"&gt;Thielemann (2002), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vijaya Dasa]], [[Gopala Dasa]] and [[Jagannatha Dasa]] are the most prominent among the saint-poets belonging of the "didactic period".&lt;ref name="hari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enrich"/&gt; The scholar Mutalik classifies Haridasa devotional songs into the following categories: "biographical, socio-religious, ethical and ritualistic, didactic and philosophical, meditative, narrative and eulogistic and miscellaneous".&lt;ref name="hari"/&gt; Their contribution to Hindu mysticism and the ''bhakti'' literature is similar to the contributions of the Alvars and [[Nayanmar]]s of modern [[Tamil Nadu]] and that of the devotional saint-poets of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="vedanta"&gt;Sharma (2000), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash, about 300 saint-poets from this cadre enriched Kannada literature during the 18th&amp;ndash;19th century&lt;ref name="enrich"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Basava statue crop.png|left|upright|thumb|Basavanna, protagonist of many a Veerashaiva writing]]
After a break of more than three centuries, writing of ''vachana'' poems was revived. Though some poets such as Tontada Siddhalingayati (1540), Swatantra Siddhalingeswara (1565), Ganalingideva (1560), Shanmukha Swamy (1700), Kadasiddheswara (1725) and Kadakolu Madivallappa (1780) attempted to re-popularise the tradition with noteworthy pieces, they lacked the mastery of the 12th century social reformers.&lt;ref name="mastery"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of the later day ''vachanakaras'' (''lit.'' "Vachana poets") were undoubtedly [[Sarvajna]] and [[Shishunala Sharif|Sisunala Sherif]] (late 18th century).&lt;ref name="sar-sisu"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 377, p. 379; Shipley (2007), p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarlived"/&gt; Sarvajna is known to have lived sometime between the mid-16th century and the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="sarlived"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sisunala"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Prasad (1987), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ''vachana'' poetic tradition had come to a temporary halt, the creation of anthologies and commentaries based on the earlier ''vachana'' canon, depicting the 12th century Veerashaiva saints as its protagonists, became popular from around c.&amp;nbsp;1400. Among well-known 16th century anthologists were Channaveeracharya (16th century) and Singalada Siddhabasava (c.&amp;nbsp;1600) who interpreted the ''vachanas'' from a purely philosophical and meta-physical context.&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 188&amp;ndash;189&lt;/ref&gt; In the Keladi court, notable works on doctrine, such as ''Virasaivadharma siromani'' ("Crest jewel of the moral order of the Veerashaivas") and ''Virasaivananda chandrike'' ("Moonlight to delight the Veerashaivas") were written.&lt;ref name="chandra"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; A new genre of mystic ''Kaivalya'' literature, a synthesis of the Veerashaiva and the [[Advaitha]] (monistic) philosophy, consolidated from the 16th century onwards. While the most famous writings are ascribed to [[Nijaguna Shivayogi]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1500), later day writers such as Mahalingaranga (''Anubhavamrita'' in ''shatpadi'' metre, c.&amp;nbsp;1675) and Chidanandavadhuta (''Jnana Sindhu'') are also notable.&lt;ref name="pieces"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern literature===
{{Main article|Modern Kannada literature}}
The birth of modern expression in the Kannada language can be traced to the early 19th century, a transition that in later decades included the influence of [[English literature]] on local traditions.&lt;ref name="assert"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest examples of modern literature came in the form of prose, either inspired by or renderings of Sanskrit classics, in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III. The king himself was an accomplished Kannada writer to whom is ascribed the prose romance ''Saugandhika Parinaya''.&lt;ref name="assert"/&gt; Under the patronage of the king, Kempu Narayana wrote ''Mudramanjusha'' ("The Seal Casket", 1823), a historical novel and an innovative version of the Sanskrit original, ''Mudrarakshasa'' by Vishaka Datta. This work is considered the trailblazer in modern Kannada prose.&lt;ref name="assert"/&gt;

English-language education, the role of missionaries, their translation of the [[Bible]] into Kannada in 1820, the arrival of the printing press, publication of newspapers and periodicals and the earliest Kannada-English and English-Kannada dictionaries helped to modernise Kannada prose.&lt;ref name="prose"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 168; Kamath (2001), pp. 278&amp;ndash;280&lt;/ref&gt; Development of prose narrative came by way of translations of Christian classics, such as ''Yatrikana Sanchara'' (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', 1847). Dramatic literature got its impetus from translations of Sanskrit and English classics (''[[Shakuntala]]'' in 1869; ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').&lt;ref name="shakuntala"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 168&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt; The modern novel, with a reformist outlook, was born in 1892. This milestone was followed by the earliest social plays with similar themes, a trend that had already set roots in the modern literature of Marathi and Bengali languages.&lt;ref name="farce"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Muddanna (or Nandalike Lakshminarayana) stands out as a unique writer, whose language is Old-Kannada but whose sensibilities are modern. His two important works were ''Adbhuta Ramayana'' (1895) and ''Ramaswamedham'' (1898). The latter work is historically important to prose development &amp;ndash; ancient epic is handled from a modern viewpoint. The narrator is the author and the listener his wife. Muddanna's declaration ''Padyam Vadhyam, Gadyam Hridyam'' (''lit.'' "Poetry deserves killing whereas prose reaches the heart") summarises the trends in Kannada literature in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="padyam"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition from Vijayanagara===
With the waning of the Vijayanagara empire, Raja Wodeyar I (r. 1578&amp;ndash;1617) became the first ruler of political importance at Mysore, having ousted the Vijayanagara governor at [[Srirangapatna]]. However, the fledgling kingdom still owed nominal allegiance to the diminished empire.&lt;ref name="sovereign"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of an independent state that would influence regional polity and culture was laid in this period. In the following decades, the Mysore court became the inheritor of the Vijayanagara literary legacy and a centre for textual production not only in Kannada, the native language, but to some extent, even in Telugu and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="keladi"/&gt; The earliest available Kannada language writings from the Mysore court are by [[Tirumalarya|Tirumalarya I]] (or Tirumala Iyengar), Raja Wodeyar I's court poet. He composed the ''Karna Vrittanta Kathe'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1600) in ''sangatya'' metre, a composition rendered to the accompaniment of an instrument.&lt;ref name="kan10"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Raja Wodeyar I's grandson, Chamaraja VI (r. 1617&amp;ndash;1637), is the earliest among the Mysore kings known for their personal contribution to the fine arts. The king wrote ''Chamarajokti Vilasa'', a translation of the Sanskrit [[Ramayana]], in the [[Valmiki]] tradition.&lt;ref name="sovereign"/&gt; &lt;!--Other writings that belong to his reign are the treatises ''Ashwashastra'', ''Hayasara Samucchaya'' and ''Brahmottra Khanda''.&lt;ref name="kan11"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

During the rule of King [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I|Kanthirava Narasaraja Wodeyar I]] (r. 1637&amp;ndash;1659), the kingdom attained complete freedom, as evidenced from the issue of gold coins called ''phanams'', similar to ones issued by the Vijayanagara empire. This event was followed by a period of political expansion within modern southern Karnataka and a successful military encounter against the invading [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] commander Ranadullah Khan.&lt;ref name="phanam"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 227&amp;ndash;228&lt;/ref&gt; Govinda Vaidya, the most well-known poet in the royal court, wrote ''Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya'' (1648) in ''sangatya'' metre.&lt;ref name="kantiravavijaya"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In this eulogy, written in 26 chapters, Vaidya compares his patron king to "God [[Narasimha]]" (an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu). The writing also gives useful details about the kingdom, its social events, urban life, the king's court, the types of music composed by the court musicians and the instruments they used to render them.&lt;ref name="desika"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 227; Pranesh (2003), pp. 11&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Bhattakalanka Deva]], a Jain writer from Haduvalli in [[South Kanara]] excelled as a grammarian of extraordinary talent. He was the last of the three notables who wrote comprehensively on Old-Kannada grammar ([[Nagavarma II]] and [[Keshiraja]] being the other two).&lt;ref name="bhatta"/&gt; He was an expert in Sanskrit grammar as well. His extant Kannada grammar,  ''Karnataka Sabdanusasanam'', containing 592 Sanskrit ''sutras'' (a literary form written for concision) with ''vritti'' (glossary) and ''vyakhya'' (commentary), is written in four ''padas'' (chapters) and makes useful references to contemporary and earlier writers. His work is modelled after that of earlier Sanskrit grammarians, [[Pāṇini|Panini]], [[Pujyapada]] and others, and is considered an exhaustive work. The author's emphasis on the importance of Kannada language and its rich literary and poetic history is evident and was meant to be a rebuttal to the attitude shown by contemporary Sanskrit scholars towards Kannada language.&lt;ref name="bhatta"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 476&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadaksharadeva, who attempted to revive the classical (Sanskritised) ''champu'' metre, belonged to the [[Adikavi Pampa|Pampa]] tradition.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; A Veerashaiva by faith and the head of the [[Yelandur]] monastery, he was under the patronage of the Mysore court. A bilingual writer in Sanskrit and Kannada, his writings propagate his faith in the god Shiva. He wrote three well-known works in Kannada:&lt;ref name="yelandur"/&gt; ''Rakashekara Vilasa'' (1655), his best-known poetic work, written during his early days, has love as the main theme and rivals the poems in [[Lakshmisa]]'s ''Jaimini Bharata'' (17th century).&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; It is derived from a well-known devotional Tamil story of Satyendra Chola and is known to be based on an earlier work, ''Bhavachintaratna'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1513), by Kannada writer Gubbi Mallanarya of Vijayanagara.&lt;ref name="yelandur"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 3934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; In a noteworthy piece of [[elegy|elegiac]] poetry, the poet describes the lamentation of a mother in his own inimitable style. Upon hearing the news of her son's death by trampling under the hooves of Prince Rajashekara's horse, the mother rushes to the scene, and mourns, holding the body of her son in her lap.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p.1149&amp;ndash;1150&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vrishabhendra Vijaya'' (1671), a poem of epic proportions, written in forty-two [[canto]]s and 4,000 stanzas, is an account of the 12th century reformer [[Basavanna]]. ''Sabarasankara Vilasa'' is a poem in five cantos narrating a popular tale of the battle between the god Shiva and the [[Pandava]] prince [[Arjuna]]. To test Arjuna's devotion to him, Shiva disguises himself as a hunter and fights a fierce battle with Arjuna. Toward the end, impressed with Arjuna's devotion, Shiva bestows on him a weapon called ''Pashuptastra''.&lt;ref name="yelandur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pashupa"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable Kannada writers in the court of Kanthirava Narasaraja I (r. 1637&amp;ndash;1659) were Shantaveera Deshika (''Shivaganga Charitra'' in ''sangatya'' metre, 1650),&lt;ref name="shivaganga"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Bhaskara (''Beharaganita'', on mathematics, early 17th century), Nanjakavi (''Kanthirava Narasaraja Charitra'', a historical, early 17th century) and Timmarasa (''Markandeya Ramayana'', the story of the god Rama which forms an episode in the forest section of the epic Mahabharata, c.&amp;nbsp;1650).&lt;ref name="markandeya"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narasa"&gt;Rice (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Chamaiah, a court poet,  wrote an account of his patron, King [[Dodda Kempadevaraja|Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar]] (r. 1659&amp;ndash;1673) in ''Devarajendra Sangatya'' (late 17th century), and Channarya wrote a metrical history of the same king in ''Devaraja Vijaya'' (late 17th century).&lt;ref name="kan14"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89; Pranesh (2003), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Tirumalabhatta, a court poet of the Keladi ruler Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka (r. 1586&amp;ndash;1629) wrote the poem ''Shivagita''.&lt;ref name="gita"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 220, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golden age ===
The reign of King [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] (r. 1673&amp;ndash;1704) is a high point in the early history of the Kingdom of Mysore. The king, an able warrior known to have defeated even the [[Maratha]]s on occasion, held the upper hand against the [[Nizam]] of [[Golconda]] and brought the [[Keladi]] territories under his domain by 1682. An able administrator, the king was inclined towards the Srivaishnava faith.&lt;ref name="vai"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 228&amp;ndash;229&lt;/ref&gt; His reign produced numerous prolific writers, not the least the king himself &amp;ndash; he was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and a composer of music.&lt;ref name="chikka"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78; Shipley (2007), p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chikka10"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 229&amp;ndash;230; Pranesh (2003), pp. 20&amp;ndash;21; Narasimhacharya (2001), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known treatise on music called ''Geeta Gopala'', written in opera style and in the ''saptapadi'' metre, is credited to him. Though inspired by [[Jayadeva]]'s ''Geeta Govinda'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1200), it had an originality of its own. The work differs from the original in that the god Krishna and his Gopikas are the protagonists of the play instead of Krishna and his consort [[Radha]].&lt;ref name="sapta"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78; Pranesh (2003), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The writing consists of fourteen sections, with seven songs in each section. It is considered an asset to students of music and literature. The king's other works are commentaries on the [[Bhagavata]] and the later chapters of the epic [[Mahabharata]], a collection of devotional poems written in thirty verses (''Chikkadevaraya binappa'', "Kings Petition") and composed in praise of the god Cheluva Narayanaswamy of [[Melkote]].&lt;ref name="upa"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirumalarya II, a native of [[Srirangapatna]] and a descendent of Tirumalarya I, was held in high esteem in the Mysore court. A childhood friend of the King Chikka Devaraja, he served as his minister.&lt;ref name="childhood"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90; Pranesh (2003), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Tirumalarya II authored five notable writings: ''Chikka Devaraja Saptapadi'' (''saptapadi'' metre, 1698), an important musical treatise rendered in seven sections comprising fifty-two songs which exalts the patron king to the level of "God on Earth";&lt;ref name="tiru"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 28&amp;ndash;30&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apratimavira Charite'' ("History of the Peerless Hero"), a rhetorical eulogy of the king and a treatise on poetics; ''Chikkadevaraja Vijaya'', an account of the king's conquests, his life and his ancestors, in the ''champu'' metre comprising six chapters; ''Chikkadevaraya Yaso-bhushana''; and the prose piece ''Chikkadevaraja Vamshavali'', one of the earliest available contemporary historicals in Kannada language describing the king's ancestry.&lt;ref name="tiru1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 23&amp;ndash;24, 62, 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 77&amp;ndash;78; Rice (1921), pp. 89&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Tirumalarya II composed seventy songs, most of which are in Kannada and a few in Telugu.&lt;ref name="tirumala"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister [[Chikkupadhyaya]] (or Lakshmipathi), a native of Terakanambi town in [[Mysore district]] was a zealous Srivaishnava and one of the most prolific Kannada writers of his time. To his credit are over thirty works, mostly in the ''sangatya'' and ''champu'' metres, and ''gadya'' (prose).&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 23; Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 213; Pranesh (2003), pp. 31&amp;ndash;32&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known works are ''Vishnupurana'' (prose and ''champu'' versions, 1691); ''Divya Suri Charitre'', a history of the twelve [[Alvar]] saints; ''Artha Panchaka'' ("Five truths"), on saint Pillai Lokacharya; a commentary on ''Tiruvayimole'' of saint [[Nammalvar]]; ''Kamalachala Mahatmya'' (1680); ''Hastigiri Mahatmya'' (1679); ''Rukmangada Charite'' (1681); ''Satvikabrahma-Vidya-Vilasa'', treating on the [[Visishtadvaita]] philosophy;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mahat"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yadugiri Mahatmya'', a eulogy of saint Kadambi Srirangacharya; ''Yadavagiri Mahatmya'', a eulogy of saint Kadambi Lakshmanacharya; and a collection of seventy songs called ''Shringarada Hadugalu'' in praise of his patron Chikka Devaraja  (pen-name "Chikkadevaraja").&lt;ref name="Upadhyaya"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 31&amp;ndash;32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lakshmisa]], a superb story-teller, a dramatist and a Vaishnava by faith, is one of the most well-known writers of ''kavyas'' (narrative poems). Kannada scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash opines he lived in the mid-16th century, but R. Narasimhacharya and historian Nilakanta Sastri claim he was active in  the late 17th century, probably during the rule of King Chikka Devaraja.&lt;ref name="dated"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 59; Sastri (1955), p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dated10"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 210; Kamath (2001), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Jaimini Bharata'', written in ''shatpadi'' metre, is the poet's Kannada version of the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]] and is one of the most popular poems of the late medieval age.&lt;ref name="jai"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Sastri (1955), p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of stories, the epic poem contains the famous tale of the ''Sita Parityaga'' ("Repudiation of Sita"). The author has succeeded in converting a religious story into a very human tale, making it popular even in modern times. For his deft usage of the language, the poet earned the honorific ''Upamalola'' (''lit.'' "One of revels in similes and metaphors").&lt;ref name="lakshmi"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1182&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaraya, a brother of Tirumalarya II, wrote ''Mitravinda Govinda'' (1680), the earliest available classical drama in Kannada. It is a play inspired by the Sanskrit drama ''Ratnavali'' ("Pearl necklace") by King [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]].&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 62; Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1077&lt;/ref&gt; Among notable women poets, Srirangamma (1685) wrote ''Padmini Kalyana'' ("Marriage of Padmini"), and Sanchi Honnamma, a [[Vokkaliga]] from Yelandur, wrote ''Hadibadeya Dharma'', on the duties of a faithful wife. This work, which won her many accolades, is in nine sections, containing 479 stanzas, and is written in ''sangatya'' metre. Despite being employed as a betel bag bearer and as a maid to Queen Devajammani, she claimed Alasingaraya, a court poet, her Guru. Her work narrates the struggles of women in society, and stresses their need to fulfill their daily roles in family life.&lt;ref name="hon"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Pranesh (2003), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hon1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 230; Mukherjee (1999), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers under the patronage of King Chikka Devaraja were: Chidananda, a [[Jain]] poet wrote philosophical compositions called ''Tatwada Kirtanegalu'' (1675), ''Neeti Nrimaya'' and ''Munivamsha Bhyudaya'' in ''sangatya'' metre; Vaikunta Dasa (1680), a native of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] composed ''[[kirtan]]es'' on the god Vishnu (pen-name "Vaikunta") and songs such as ''Kapatamata'';&lt;ref name="vaikunta"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Pranesh (2003), pp. 32&amp;ndash;33&lt;/ref&gt; Timmakavi (''Hari Vilasa'' in ''sangatya'' metre and ''Yadavagiri Mahatmya'', 1677); Mallikarjuna (''Sriranga Mahatmya'', 1678) and Mallarasa (''Dasavatara Charite'')&lt;ref name="dasavatara"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Pranesh (2003), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Brahmin writers worthy of mention from the 17th century are Ramachandra (''Asrasastra''), Tirumalevaidya (''Uttara Ramayana'', 1650), Nagarasa of [[Pandharpur]] (''Bhagavadgite''), Timmarasa (''Kshetraganita'' on geometry),&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and Venkayarya, a Haridasa of [[Penukonda]] (''Krishnalilabhyudaya'').&lt;ref name="penu"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Among Jains, Padmana Pandita (''Hayasara Samuchchaya'') and Chandrashekara (''Ramachandra charitra'', story of the Hindu god [[Rama]]) are notable.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; Among Veerashaiva writers, Harisvara (''Prabhudeva Purana''), Siddhananjesa, (''Raghavanka Charitra'' and ''Gururaja Charitra''), Prasabhushana (or Pemmisetti, ''Gurubhaktandara Charitre''), Mummadi Tamma (''Sankara Samhita''), Parvatesvara (''Chatuacharya Purana'') and Sejjeya Siddhalingaraya (''Malayaraja Charite'') are well-known.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;

===Age of Sarvajna===
{{Kannada poets in 18th century}}
A mendicant Veerashaiva poet, a moralist and a drifter whose early days are unclear, Sarvajna (''lit.'' "The all knowing"), has left his indelible mark on Kannada literature and the Kannada-speaking people. He is known to have been a native of either Abbalur or Madagamasuru in the [[Dharwad district]]. Based on literary evidence scholars place him  variously between the 16th and 18th centuries. Prabhu Prasad of the [[Sahitya Akademi]] feels he belonged to the 16th century while Kannada scholars R. Narasimhacharya and H.S. Shiva Prakash claim he lived in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="assign"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; To Sarvajna goes the credit of re-vitalising the ''vachana'' poetic tradition. His witty and didactic poems, numbering over 2,000, were written using the simple ''tripadi'' metre.&lt;ref name="sarlived"/&gt; Some clues in his first fourteen of a series of poems ("Reminiscences of Birth") give an indication about his birth, parentage and his reasons for leaving home at an early age.&lt;ref name="dhar"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; His poems after the 14th focus on his spiritual quest.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 9&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarvajna, who is not known to have acquired a formal education, gained knowledge from the world, writing poems impromptu about the nature of people and places. According to the scholar Naikar, Sarvajna was born to "sing the truth and truth alone".&lt;ref name="world"&gt;Naikar (2008), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His poems cover a vast range of topics, from caste and religion to economics and administration, from arts and crafts to family life and health. People from a broad spectrum of life were commented upon: "Professionals such as priests, astrologers, sorcerers, tax collectors and accountants; artisans such as smiths, carpenters, tailors and potters; and businessmen such as oil men, money-lenders, fishermen and farmers", all have caught the poet's discerning eye. Sarvajna reserved his compliments only for the farmers, weavers, real spiritual seekers and chaste housewives.&lt;ref name="sarlived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="life10"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 17&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt; A tomb in [[Hirekerur]] town in the Haveri district is said to be his final resting place.&lt;ref name="guru"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; His poems, all of which end with his name "Sarvajna", constitute some of Kannada's most popular works. Sarvajna is to Kannada language what [[Bhartrhari]] is to Sanskrit language, [[Vemana]] is to [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]] is to [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Neither was he patronized by royalty nor did he write for fame or money.&lt;ref name="morals"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt; His main aim was to instruct people about morality with poems such as these:&lt;ref name="vacpoems"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 191&amp;ndash;192; Prasad (1987), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|A begging bowl in hand,&lt;br&gt;

{{Haridasa poets (Kannada) of 17th-19th century}}
During the first half of the 18th century Mysore's independence was delicately balanced, with the incumbent kings accepting either a nominal subordination or a strategic alliance with the larger power, the Mughals of [[India|northern India]], by paying tribute while keeping the [[Maratha empire|Marathas]] (Baji Rao I) of the [[Deccan plateau]] at bay. From the 1830s, the kings also came under the sway of the powerful ''Dalavoy'' (or ''Dalwai'', Prime minister) Nanjaraja (or Nanjarajaiah) and ''Sarvadhikari'' (Chief minister) Devaraja (or Devarajaiah), the influential Kalale brothers of [[Nanjangud]].&lt;ref name="dalavoy"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 229&amp;ndash;230; Pranesh (2003), pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, literary contributions were made by some members of the royal family including King Narasaraja Wodeyar II, Nanjaraja and Queen Cheluvambe.&lt;ref name="kan5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nanja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shalya"/&gt;

Yakshagana, a rustic form of theatre which draws upon themes from the Hindu epics, the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Bhagavata]], has an established history in the Kannada speaking region of over 400 years.&lt;ref name="region"/&gt; In its rudimentary form, the script of the play contains ''prasanga'' (poetic songs) sung by the ''bhagavata'' (musician), to which improvised ''matu'' (dialogue) is added. Witty comments are interjected by ''hasyagaras'' (clowns). Musical instruments include ''maddale'' and ''chende'' (types of drums), and a ''sruti'' ([[Pump organ|harmonium]]-like instrument). The ''rangasthala'' (acting arena) could be a temple compound, an open space near the patron's house or a clearing in a paddy field.&lt;ref name="harmonium"&gt;Brandan and Banham (1993), pp. 115&amp;ndash;116&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sugriva Vijaya'' (mid-16th century) by Kandukuru Rudrakavi is one of the earliest available manuscripts of a Yakshagana play. It is based on the story of the ape-like humanoid king [[Sugriva]] who overthrew his powerful brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] to regain his kingdom in the Hindu epic Ramayana.&lt;ref name="region"/&gt; While scholars such as M.M Bhat, Shivarama Karanth and R.R. Diwakar have proposed various theories about the origin and forerunners of the Yakshagana art,&lt;ref name="rajarama"&gt;Ashton (2003), pp. 17&amp;ndash;23&lt;/ref&gt; N. Venkata Rao, editor of ''The Southern school in Telugu literature'' (1960), gives the credit of writing the earliest available Yakshagana plays that include ''sangita'' (music), ''nataka'' (drama) and ''natya'' (dance) to the polyglot king of Mysore, [[Narasaraja Wodeyar II|Narasaraja II]] (r. 1704&amp;ndash;1714).&lt;ref name="kan5"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The king was proficient in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Prakrit. His fourteen Yakshagana compositions, written in various languages but in the Kannada script, were discovered at the government manuscripts library in [[Chennai]].&lt;ref name="wod"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 37&amp;ndash;38&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, Yakshagana had become popular in Mysore and nearby Yelandur, where stage troupes were active.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;

===Revival of Haridasa literature===
The Haridasa literature propagates the ''dvaita'' (dualistic) philosophy of Madhvacharya. Their compositions have also been of immense value to the development of music and literature in general. While ''Hari'' (a form of god Vishnu)  is central to their beliefs, their compositions show tolerance to other Vaishnava deities as well. By bringing the values cherished in the [[Upanishad]]s (scripture) and [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred texts) to the commoner in simple Kannada, these itinerant Haridasas made valuable contributions as "minstrels of God".&lt;ref name="bhimava"/&gt; With the passing of the [[Vijayanagara]] era, the creation of the Haridasa literature slowed down for about a century, despite attempts by two ''dasa'' (devotee) poets, Mahapati Dasa (1611&amp;ndash;1681), who wrote 600 compositions, and his son Krishna Dasa.&lt;ref name="rao"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 883&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition however recovered in the early 18th century under the able guidance of [[Vijaya Dasa]] (1687&amp;ndash;1755),&lt;ref name="inspire"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; a native of Ceekalaparavi in the [[Raichur district]]. Vijaya Dasa was inspired by the establishment of the monastery of saint [[Raghavendra Swami]] (of the Madhvacharya order) at [[Mantralayam]] town. His lyrical compositions, said to be 25,000 in all, are written in the [[Purandara Dasa]] tradition with the pen-name (''ankita'') "Vijaya Vittala".&lt;ref name="rao"/&gt; Most well-known among his many disciples is [[Gopala Dasa]] who wrote with the pen-name "Gopala Vittala" (1721&amp;ndash;1769).&lt;ref name="inspire"/&gt; Later, Gopala Dasa inspired another famous saint-poet, Jagannatha Dasa, to take to the Haridasa fold.&lt;ref name="rao"/&gt;

Jagannatha Dasa (1728&amp;ndash;1809) is considered the most notable of the late-18th century Haridasas. Apart from a number of devotional songs, he is credited with two important writings. The ''Harikathamritasara'' treats on the philosophy of Madhvacharya. Written in the ''shatpadi'' metre with a poetic touch, it contains 32 chapters of 988 stanzas.&lt;ref name="tattva"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1764&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tattva Suvvali'', containing 1,200 pithy and proverbial poems written in the ''tripadi'' metre, is known to have been a consolation to his widowed daughter.&lt;ref name="tattva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tatva"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Among women, Helavanakatte Giriyamma (pen-name "Helavanakatte Ranga", early 18th century) and Harapanhally Bhimava (pen-name "Bhimesa Krishna", 1890) are notable despite their humble education and background. Giriyamma authored more than forty songs, and five narrative poems, the best known among which is the devotional piece  ''Chandrahasana Kathe''.&lt;ref name="bhimava"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mahi"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 201; Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dasas"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In a  prayer poem about famine, Giriyamma wrote:&lt;ref name="enrich"/&gt;
{{Quote|Women are taking out in vessels&lt;br&gt;

===Other writings===
Cheluvambe, a queen of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar I (r. 1714&amp;ndash;1732), was an accomplished Kannada writer. Her notable works include ''Varanandi Kalyana'',  written in the ''sangatya'' metre.&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt; The story narrates the wedding of Varanandi, the daughter of the Badshah (Emperor) of Delhi, and the god Cheluvaraya Swamy of [[Melkote]]. In the writing, the author envisioned Varanandi to be a reincarnation of [[Satyabhama]], the consort of the Hindu god Krishna. Her other compositions include ''Venkatachala Mahatmyam'' &amp;ndash; a lullaby song written in ''choupadi'' (4-line verse) metre in devotion to the Hindu god [[Venkateshwara]] residing on the Vrishabha hill, songs centred on Alamelu Mangamma, the consort of the Hindu god Venkateshwara of [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], and songs in praise of the god Cheluvanarayana.&lt;ref name="manga"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 42&amp;ndash;43&lt;/ref&gt; Shalyada Krishnaraja, a poet and a member from the royal family was proficient writer in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit. His contributions to Kannada literature include devotional songs, ''vachana'' poems, compositions in ''sangatya'' metre (''Nija Dipika Ratna''), ''gadya'' (''Anubhava Rasayana''), and ''kirthane'' compositions (''Bhakti Marga Sarovara'', ''Gnana Sarovara'' and ''Shalyada Arasinavara Tikina Kirtane'').&lt;ref name="shalya"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 49&amp;ndash;50&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanjaraja was the most noted of the Shaiva writers in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar II (r. 1734&amp;ndash;1766). For his literary taste, he earned the honorific "Nutana Bhojaraja", a comparison to the medieval [[Bhoja|King Bhoja]]. A native of Kalale town near [[Nanjangud]], Nanjaraja came from an influential family of warriors, statesman and scholars. He was politically active and is known to have created a power centre, holding court in parallel to Krishnaraja II.&lt;ref name="nanja"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  He was proficient in multiple languages and authored more than twenty writings in Kannada, Sanskrit and Telugu. Among his Kannada writings, ''Kukudgiri Mahatmya'',&lt;ref name="maha"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical composition called ''Aravattu muvara trivadhi'', an account of the life of 63 ancient devotees of the god Shiva, is well known.&lt;ref name="trivadi"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known Shaiva writers were Chenniah, who wrote in the ''sangatya'' metre (''Padmini Parinaya'', 1720),&lt;ref name="padmini"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nuronda, who eulogised his patron Krishnaraja II in ''Soundarya Kavya'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1740) in ''sangatya'' metre, and Sankara Kavi (''Chorabasava Charitre'', 18th century).&lt;ref name="sankara"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 25; Pranesh (2003), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Linganna Kavi wrote a ''champu'' historical piece called ''Keladinripavijayam'' in the 1763&amp;ndash;1804 period accounting for the chronology and history of the Keladi dynasty. The work also gives useful information about contemporary kingdoms and states including the Nawabs of Savanur, the Marathas and the Mughals.&lt;ref name="nawab"&gt;Ciṭaṇīsa and Chitnis (2000), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Jain writers of the period were Payanna (''Ahimsacharitre''), Padmaraja (''Pujyapada Charitre'', 1792), Padmanabha (''Ramachandra Charitre''), Surala (''Padmavati Charitre''), and Jayendra (''Karnataka Kuvalayananda'').&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt; Vaishnava writers who distinguished themselves were Lakshmakavi (''Bharata'' in 1728 and ''Rukmangada Charite''), Venkatesha (''Halasya Mahatmya'', in ''champu'' metre), Konayya (''Krishnarjuna Sangara''), Timmamatya (''Ramabhyudaya Kathakusumamanjari'', a version of the epic Ramayana), Timmarya of [[Anekal]] (''Ananda Ramayana'', 1708), Balavaidya Cheluva (''Lilavati'', and an encyclopedia of precious stones called ''Ratnasastra''),&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt; and Puttayia (''Maisuru Arasugala Purvabhyudaya'', c.&amp;nbsp;1713, an account of the history of the Kingdom of Mysore).&lt;ref name="putta"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), pp. 89, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century writings==

===Age of prose and drama===
After the death of [[Tipu Sultan]] in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war (1799), the British took control of the kingdom. They however restored the Wodeyars in the smaller [[princely state]] of Mysore under the [[paramountcy]] of the [[British Raj]]. The British took direct control of the administration of the kingdom in 1831, after which Maharaja [[Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar|Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]] devoted all his time to developing the fine arts, earning him the honorific "Abhinava Bhoja" (''lit.'' "Modern [[Bhoja]]").&lt;ref name="bhoj"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 249, 278; Pranesh (2003), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnaraja III (1799&amp;ndash;1868) is called the "Morning Star of the Renaissance in Karnataka".&lt;ref name="star"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; A patron of the fine arts, he was an accomplished writer, musician, musicologist and composer.&lt;ref name="mantra"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55&lt;/ref&gt; He gave munificent grants to scholars and was a prolific writer himself. Of the over forty writings attributed to him, a prose romance called ''Saugandhika Parinaya'', in two versions (a ''sangatya'' composition and a play) is best known.&lt;ref name="sou"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 26; Murthy (1992), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In this writing, the author imaginatively narrates the story of the sage [[Durvasa]] who curses Devendra (the Hindu god [[Indra]]) to be born as Sucharitra, the son of King Sugandharaya of Ratnapuri. Devendra's wife Shachidevi takes birth as Sougandhika and marries Sucharitra.&lt;ref name="indra"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from composing many devotional songs to his deity, the Hindu goddess Chamundeshwari (pen-name "Chamundi"), he authored three noteworthy treatises: ''[[Sritattvanidhi|Sri Tatwanidhi]]'' and ''Swara Chudamani'' (on music) in Sanskrit language and Kannada script,  and ''Sara Sangraha Bharata'' (on dance and music), dealing with [[Tala (music)|tala]] (rhythm) in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="swara"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 55, 58, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliya Lingaraja Urs, a native of [[Heggadadevanakote]] and a son-in-law (''Aliya'') of Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer with over fifty works spanning various genres: devotional songs, musical compositions, ''kavya'' (classical poems), over thirty Yakshagana plays, and other dramas. The author used multiple pen-names including, "lingaraja" and "linganripa". For his contributions to the fine arts, he earned the title ''Ubhaya Kavita Visharada'' (''lit.'' "Master of poetry in two languages" &amp;ndash; Kannada and Sanskrit).&lt;ref name="linga"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 78&amp;ndash;80&lt;/ref&gt; Among his best-known Kannada works are the poem ''Prabhavati Parinaya'' and the two versions of the classical epic ''Girija Kalyana'' ("Marriage of the mountain born goddess"), in Yakshagana style and in ''sangatya'' metre. The writing gives an account of the Girija, the daughter of Himavanta, her youthful days and her successful penance which resulted in her marriage to the Hindu god Shiva.&lt;ref name="hima"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 80; Murthy (1992), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prabha"&gt;Narasimhacharya (2003), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Yadava, also a court-poet, penned two prose pieces, ''Kalavati Parinaya'' (1815) in the ''dandaka vritta'' (blank verse) metre and ''Vachana Kadambari'', a prose rendering of the classical Sanskrit original by poet Bana.&lt;ref name="assert"/&gt;

The Jain poet Devachandra (1770&amp;ndash;1841), a native of Kankagiri,  was in the court of Krishnaraja III and authored three noted works: ''Pujyapada Charite'', a poem on the life of the Jain saint [[Pujyapada]] in ''sangatya'' metre; ''Ramakathavatara'', the poet's Jain version of the Hindu epic Ramayana in ''champu'' metre; and ''Rajavalikathe'' (1838), a biographical account of the Mysore royal family, some earlier poets, and stories of religious importance.&lt;ref name="royalaccount"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), pp. 89, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Another Jain writer of merit was Chandrasagaravarni, author of ''Kadambapurana'' and other works.&lt;ref name="prabha"/&gt; Devalapurada Nanjunda of [[Nanjangud]], a mere court attendant, rose to the level of a court poet for his scholarship in Kannada and Sanskrit. Among his many compositions, ''Sougandhika Parinaya'' in ''sangatya'' metre, ''Samudra Mathana Kathe'' (a Yakshagana play), ''Sri Krishna Sarvabhoumara Charitre'' in ''sangatya'' metre, and ''Krishnendra Gite'' in ''choupadi'' metre are well-known. He earned the honorific ''Ubhaya Bhasha Kavi'' ("Poet of two languages").&lt;ref name="kris"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 87&amp;ndash;88&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Kannada prose saw its nascent beginning in 1823 with ''Mudra Manjusha'' ("Seal Casket"). It is an elaboration of a play summarised in the Sanskrit original, ''Mudra Rakshasa'' by Vishakadatta, and was written by Kempu Narayana, a court poet of Maharaja Krishnaraja III.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 280; Mukherjee (1999), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===External influences===
[[File:Kittel, Ferdinand (1832-1903).jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand Kittel (1854)]]
Eager to spread their gospel in Kannada, Christian missionaries took to the Kannada language. The establishment of the printing press and English language education had a positive effect on Kannada prose. Periodicals and newspapers were published for the first time.&lt;ref name="publish"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The first Kannada language book was printed in 1817 and the first Bible in 1820. Grammar books and dictionaries, meant to help the missionaries in their effort in spreading Christianity, became available. Rev. W. Reeve compiled the earliest English-Kannada dictionary in 1824 followed by a Kannada-English dictionary in 1832, though the best-known work is an 1894 publication by Rev. [[Ferdinand Kittel]]. Rev. William Carrey published the earliest Kannada grammar in 1817.&lt;ref name="rev"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 279&amp;ndash;280; Murthy (1992), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of English literature and poetry on Kannada was evident from the numerous songs of prayer composed by the missionaries.&lt;ref name="song"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; British officers [[Lewis Rice]] and [[John Faithfull Fleet]] deciphered numerous Kannada inscriptions. Rice published several ancient classics and a brief history of Kannada literature while Fleet published folk [[ballad]]s such as ''Sangoli Rayana Dange'' ("Sangoli Raya's Revolt").&lt;ref name="publish"/&gt; The first Kannada newspaper, ''Mangalura Samachara'' ("Mangalore News"), was published in Mangalore in 1843. In a few years, printing presses opened in many locations, including at the Mysore palace in 1840.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt;

A surge in the generation of prose narratives and dramatic literature, inspired by writings in English, Sanskrit, modern Marathi and modern Bengali languages culminated in original works in the succeeding decades.&lt;ref name="publish"/&gt; In the field of prose, translation of English classics such as ''Yatrikana Sanchara'' (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' by [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]], 1847) and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1857) set the trend. Translations from vernacular languages were popular too and included the Marathi classic ''Yamuna Prayatana'' (1869) and the Bengali work ''Durgesanandini'' (1885).&lt;ref name="marathi"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 168&amp;ndash;169; Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; In the genre of drama, inspiration came from translations of Sanskrit and English plays. ''Shakuntala'' and ''Raghavendrarao Nataka'' (''[[Othello]]'') by Churamuri Sehagiri Rao (1869), ''Pramilarjuniya'' by Srikantesa Gowda and ''Vasanthayamini Swapnachamatkara Nataka'' by K. Vasudevachar (''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]''), ''[[Macbeth]]'' by Srikantesa Gowda, ''[[King Lear]]'' by M.S. Puttanna, ''Ramavarma-Lilavati'' (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') by C. Ananda Rao paved the way.&lt;ref name="churamuri"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 169; Kamath (2001), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Basavappa Shastry (1882), a native of Mysore and court poet of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar IX, earned the honorific ''Kannada Nataka Pitamaha'' (''lit.'' "Father of Kannada stage") for his contributions to drama. His contribution to dramatic literature in the form of anthologies, translations and adaptations from English and Sanskrit, learned editions, and successful integration of musical compositions into drama is well accepted.&lt;ref name="gowri"&gt;Das (1991), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; His translations from English to Kannada include  ''Shurasena Charite'' ("Othello"). His Sanskrit to Kannada translations include, ''[[Kalidasa]]'', ''Abhignyana Shakuntala'', ''Vikramorvasheeya'', ''Malavikagnimitra'', ''Uttara Rama Charite'', ''Chanda Koushika Nataka'', ''Malathi Madhava'' and ''Ratnavali''.&lt;ref name="basava"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1077; Pranesh (2003), pp. 82&amp;ndash;83&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known Kannada writers in Chamaraja IX's court were S.G. Narasimhacharya, Dhondo Narasimha Mulabaglu, Santa Kavi and B. Ventakacharya.&lt;ref name="prabha"/&gt;

The earliest modern novels in the Kannada language are the ''Suryakantha'' by Lakshman Gadagkar (1892) and the ''Indrabayi'' (1899) by Gulvadi Venkata Rao. The later work is reformist and decried corruption and encouraged widow remarriages.&lt;ref name="surya"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 169; Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Suri Venkataramana Shastri's modern social play ''Iggappa Heggadeya Vivaha Prahasana'' ("Iggappa Heggade's farce of marriage", 1887) and Dhareswar's ''Kanya Vikraya'' (1887) carried a similar reformist outlook while Santa Kavi's ''Vatsalaharana'' (1885) drew upon mythological and folk themes.&lt;ref name="farce"/&gt;

==Developments up to the mid-20th century==
[[File:BugleRock DVG6.JPG|right |thumb |Statue of noted Kannada writer [[D. V. Gundappa]] at Bugle rock garden, Bangalore]]
In 1881, the British handed back administrative powers to the Wodeyar family. Up to 1947, when the kingdom acceded to the [[India|Union of India]], the incumbent Maharaja was assisted by a [[List of Diwans of Mysore|Diwan]] (Prime minister), the administrative chief of Mysore. These were times of positive social and economic change, the independence movement and modern nationalism, all of which influenced literature.&lt;ref name="admin"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 254, 257&amp;ndash;261, 284&amp;ndash;286, 291&amp;ndash;294&lt;/ref&gt;

Kannada literature saw the blossoming of the Navodaya (''lit''. "New beginning") style of writings in genres such as lyrical poems, drama, novels and short stories, with the strong influence of English literature.&lt;ref name="englit"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 170&amp;ndash;173&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. M. Srikantaiah]]'s ''English Geetagalu'' ("English songs", 1921) was the path-breaker in the genre of modern lyrical poetry.&lt;ref name="lyricalpoem"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 170&amp;ndash;171&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest stalwarts in the field of modern historical drama and comedy were [[T. P. Kailasam]] and A.N. Swami Venkatadri Iyer (also called "Samsa"). Kailasam sought to critique social developments by producing plays that questioned the utility of the modern education system in ''Tollu Gatti'' (1918, "The Hollow and the Solid") and the dowry system in ''Tali Kattoke Cooline'' ("Wages for tying the [[Mangalsutra]]"). Samsa's ideal king, Narasaraja Wodeyar, is the protagonist of the play  ''Vigada Vikramarya'' ("The Wicked Vikramarya", 1925).&lt;ref name="wicked"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial development in the genre of historical novels, in the form of translations and original works, sought to re-kindle the nationalistic feelings of [[Kannadigas]]. Venkatachar (''Anandamatha'') and Galaganath were among the first to write such novels. Galaganath's ''Madhava Karuna Vilasa'' (1923) described the founding of the Vijayanagara empire, while his ''Kannadigara Karmakatha'' ("Kannadigas Fateful Tale") described the empire's decline.&lt;ref name="karma"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 171&amp;ndash;172&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Alur Venkata Rao wrote the famous ''Karnataka Ghata Vaibhava'', a summary of earlier works by Fleet, Rice, Bhandarkar and Robert Sewell, appealing to the Kannadigas to remember their glorious past, their ancient traditions and culture, their great rulers, saints and poets.&lt;ref name="alur"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 281; Murthy (1992), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known works were Kerur Vasudevachar's ''Yadu Maharaja'' describing the rise of the Wodeyar dynasty, and Vasudevaiah's ''Arya Kirti'' (1896).&lt;ref name="kathe"/&gt; The tradition of novels started by Gulvadi Venkata Rao (1899) reached maturity in 1915 with M.S. Puttanna's ''Madidunno Maharaya'' ("Sir, as you sow, so you reap"), a historical novel written in flowing prose and whose theme is set in the times of Maharaja Krishnaraja III. To Puttanna also goes the credit for writing the earliest modern biography, ''Kunigal Ramashastriya Charitre'' ("The story of Kunigal Ramashastri").&lt;ref name="kathe"/&gt; The genre of short story made its initial beginnings with [[Panje Mangesh Rao]], M.N. Kamath and Kerur Vasudevachar, but it was [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]] who stole the limelight with and set a trend for others to follow in his ''Kelavu Sanne Kathegalu'' ("A few short stories", 1920) and ''Sanna Kathegalu'' ("Short stories", 1924).&lt;ref name="kathe"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of these early pioneers were to become a forerunner for the golden age in the decades to follow. A long list of noted poets and writers followed: [[D. R. Bendre]] (''Gari'', "The Wing", 1932) and [[Govinda Pai]] (''Gilivindu'', "Parrots", 1930), perhaps the most acclaimed writers of lyrical poems that synthesised the work of the English romantics with native traditions; [[K. Shivaram Karanth]], the noted novelist and author of ''Chomana Dudi'' ("Choma's Toil", 1933); [[Kuvempu]], one of Kannada's [[doyen]] poets who showed his brilliance in using the [[blank verse]] in his masterpiece epic and [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Sri Ramayana Darshanam'' (1949); [[V. K. Gokak]], a writer of drama, criticism, songs and epic (''Bharata Sindhu Rashmi'', 1940); [[D. V. Gundappa]], the philosopher-writer to whom is ascribed writings in just about every genre, though his most notable work is the ''[[Mankuthimmana Kagga]]'' ("Dull Thimma's Rigmarole", 1943), which closely compares with the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna.&lt;ref name="manku"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1057&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="others"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 173, 174, 178, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="style"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1437&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nude''' figure is a tradition in [[Western art]], and has been used to express ideals of male and female beauty and other human qualities. It was a central preoccupation of [[Ancient Greek art]], and after a semi-dormant period in the Middle Ages returned to a central position in Western art with the [[Renaissance]]. Athletes, dancers, and warriors are depicted to express human energy and life, and nudes in various poses may express basic or complex emotions such as [[pathos]].&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Ch.1 ''The Naked and the Nude''&lt;/ref&gt;  In one sense, a nude is a work of [[fine art]] that has as its primary subject the unclothed human body,&lt;ref&gt;Clark&lt;/ref&gt; forming a subject [[Genre#Visual arts|genre]] of art, in the same way as [[Landscape art|landscapes]] and [[still life]]. Unclothed figures often also play a part in other types of art, such as [[history painting]], including [[Allegory#Art|allegorical]] and [[religious art]],  [[portrait painting|portraiture]], or the [[decorative arts]].

==History==
Nude female figures called [[Venus figurine]]s are found in very early prehistoric art, and in historical times, similar images represent fertility deities.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;Graves&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of gods and goddesses in Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian art are the precursors of the works of Western antiquity. Other significant non-Western traditions of depicting nudes come from [[History of sex in India#Ancient times|India]], and Japan, but the nude does not form an important aspect of [[Chinese art]]. Temple sculptures and cave paintings, some very explicit, are part of the Hindu tradition of the value of sexuality, and as in many warm climates partial or complete nudity was common in everyday life. Japan had a tradition of mixed communal bathing that existed until recently, and was often portrayed in woodcut prints.

===Ancient Greece===

[[File:Diadoumenos-Atenas.jpg|thumb|Copy of [[Polykleitos|Polyclitus]]' [[Diadumenos]],  [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]

The earliest [[Greek sculpture]], from the early [[Bronze Age]] [[Cycladic civilization]] consists mainly of stylized male figures who are presumably nude. This is certainly the case for the [[kouros]], a large standing figure of a male nude that was the mainstay of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Greek]] sculpture. The first realistic sculptures of nude males, the kouroi depict nude youths who stand rigidly posed with one foot forward.&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"/&gt; By the 5th century BCE, Greek sculptors' mastery of anatomy resulted in greater naturalness and more varied poses. An important innovation was [[contrapposto]]—the asymmetrical posture of a figure standing with one leg bearing the body's weight and the other relaxed. An early example of this is [[Polykleitos]]' sculpture ''[[Doryphoros]]'' (ca. 440 BCE).&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"/&gt;

In the convention of [[heroic nudity]], gods and heroes were shown nude, while ordinary mortals were less likely to be so, though athletes and warriors in combat were often depicted nude.

In Ancient Greece, where the mild climate was conducive to being lightly-clothed or nude whenever convenient, and  male athletes competed at religious festivals entirely nude, and celebrated the human body, it was perfectly natural for the Greeks to associate the male nude form with triumph, glory, and even moral excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/nudity.htm|title=Nudity in Ancient to Modern Cultures|first=Aileen|last=Goodson|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek goddess Aphrodite was a deity whom the Greeks preferred to see clothed. In the mid-fourth century BC, the sculptor [[Praxiteles]] made a nude [[Aphrodite of Cnidus|Aphrodite]], called the Knidian, which established a new tradition for the female nude, having idealized proportions based on mathematical ratios as were the nude male statues. The nudes of Greco-Roman art are conceptually perfected ideal persons, each one a vision of health, youth, geometric clarity, and organic equilibrium. Kenneth Clark considered idealization the hallmark of true nudes, as opposed to more descriptive and less artful figures that he considered merely naked. His emphasis on idealization points up an essential issue: seductive and appealing as nudes in art may be, they are meant to stir the mind as well as the passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Western Art and its Beginnings in Antiquity,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian attitudes cast doubt on the value of the human body, and the Christian emphasis on chastity and celibacy further discouraged depictions of nakedness, even in the few surviving Early Medieval survivals of secular art. Completely unclothed figures are rare in medieval art, the notable exceptions being [[Adam and Eve]] and the damned in ''[[Last Judgement]]'' scenes, and the ideal forms of Greco-Roman nudes are completely lost, transformed into symbols of shame and sin, weakness and defenselessness.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;300–309&lt;/ref&gt; This was true not only in Western Europe, but also in Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, Christ was shown largely naked in scenes of his Passion, especially the [[Crucifixion of Jesus in Christian art|Crucifixion]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;221–226&lt;/ref&gt; and even when glorified in heaven, to allow him to display the wounds his sufferings had involved.  The [[Nursing Madonna]] and [[Mary Magdalene#In art|naked "Penitent Mary Magdalene"]], as well as the infant [[Jesus]], whose [[Circumcision of Jesus#Depictions in art|penis was sometimes emphasized]] for theological reasons, are other exceptions with elements of nudity in medieval religious art.

By the late medieval period female nudes intended to be attractive edged back into art, especially in the relatively private medium of the [[illuminated manuscript]], and in classical contexts such as the [[Signs of the Zodiac]] and illustrations to [[Ovid]].  The shape of the female "Gothic nude" was very different from the classical ideal, with a long body shaped by gentle curves, a narrow chest and high waist, small round breasts, and a prominent bulge at the stomach (as in the [[Hugo van der Goes]] at left).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;307–312&lt;/ref&gt; Male nudes tended to be slim and slight in figure, probably drawing on apprentices used as models, but were increasingly accurately observed.

The rediscovery of classical culture in the Renaissance restored the nude to art. [[Donatello]] made [[David (Donatello)|two statues]] of the Biblical hero [[David]], a symbol for the [[Republic of Florence]]: his first (in marble, 1408–1409) shows a clothed figure, but his second, probably of the 1440s, is the first freestanding statue of a nude since antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–50&lt;/ref&gt; several decades before [[Michelangelo]]'s massive ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501–04).  Nudes in Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] reestablished a tradition of male nudes in depictions of Biblical stories; the subject of the martyrdom of the near-naked [[Saint Sebastian]] had already become highly popular. The monumental female nude returned to Western art in 1486 with [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|''The Birth of Venus'']] by [[Sandro Botticelli]] for the [[Medici family]], who also owned the classical [[Venus de' Medici]], whose pose Botticelli adapted.

The ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Dresden Venus]]'' of [[Giorgione]] (c. 1510), also drawing on classical models, showed a reclining female nude in a landscape, beginning a long line of famous paintings including the ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' ([[Titian]], 1538), the ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' ([[Diego Velázquez]], c. 1650), [[Goya]]'s ''[[La maja desnuda|Nude Maja]]'' (c. 1798) and [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863).  Although they reflect the proportions of ancient statuary, such figures as Titian's ''Venus and the Lute Player'' and ''Venus of Urbino'' highlight the sexuality of the female body rather than its ideal geometry. In addition to adult male and female figures, the classical depiction of Eros became the model for the naked Christ child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raphael]] in his later years is usually credited as the first artist to consistently use female models for the drawings of female figures, rather than studio apprentices or other boys with breasts added, who were previously used. Michelangelo's suspiciously boyish ''[[Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment]]'' ([[Louvre]], c. 1500), which is usually said to be the first nude female [[figure study]], predates this and is an example of how even figures who would be shown clothed in the final work were often worked out in nude studies, so that the form under the clothing was understood. The nude [[figure drawing]] or figure study of a [[model (art)|live model]] rapidly became an important part of artistic practice and training, and remained so until the 20th century.

=== Baroque to Modern ===
[[File:The Three Graces, by Peter Paul Rubens, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|''[[The Three Graces (Rubens)|The Three Graces]]'' (1636–1638) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

In [[Baroque]] art, the continuing fascination with classical antiquity influenced artists to renew their approach to the nude, but with more naturalistic, less idealized depictions, perhaps more frequently working from live models.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; Both genders are represented; the male in the form of heroes such as Hercules and Samson, and female in the form of Venus and the Three Graces. [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who with evident delight painted women of generous figure and radiant flesh, gave his name to the adjective rubenesque.

In the later Baroque or [[Rococo]] period, a more decorative and playful style emerged, exemplified by [[François Boucher]]'s ''Venus Consoling Love'', likely commissioned by [[Madame Pompadour]].

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, classical subjects remained popular, along with nudes in [[historical paintings]]. In the later nineteenth century, academic painters continued with classical themes, but were challenged by the Impressionists. Eduard Manet shocked the public of his time by painting nude women in contemporary situations in his ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) and ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1865), and Gustave Courbet earned criticism for portraying in his ''[[Woman with a Parrot]]'' a naked prostitute without vestige of goddess or nymph. Edgar Degas painted many nudes of women in ordinary circumstances, such as taking a bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/degas-and-nude|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|title=Degas and the Nude|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auguste Rodin challenged classical canons of idealization in his expressively distorted Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Baroque and Later Art,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of photography, artists began using the new medium as a source for paintings, [[Eugène Delacroix]] being one of the first.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Woman3.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman III]]'' (1953) by [[Willem de Kooning]], the human body in [[Abstract Expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Although both the Academic tradition and Impressionists lost their cultural supremacy at the beginning of the twentieth century, the nude remained although transformed by the ideas of [[modernism]]. The idealized Venus was replaced by the woman intimately depicted in private settings, as in the work of [[Egon Schiele]].&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; The simplified modern forms of [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Gaston Lachaise]] and [[Aristide Maillol]] recall the original goddesses of fertility more than Greek goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In early abstract paintings, the body could be fragmented or dismembered, as in Picasso's [[Demoiselles d'Avignon]], but there are also abstracted versions of classical themes, such as [[Henri Matisse]]'s dancers and bathers.

In the post-WWII era, [[Abstract Expressionism]] moved the center of Western art from Paris to New York City. One of the primary influences in the rise of abstraction, the critic [[Clement Greenberg]], had supported de Kooning's early abstract work. Despite Greenberg's advice, the artist, who had begun as a figurative painter, returned to the human form in early 1950 with his [[Woman III|''Woman'' series]]. Although having some references to the traditions of single female figures, the women were portrayed as voracious, distorted, and semi-abstract. According to the artist, he wanted to "create the angry humor of tragedy"; having the frantic look of the atomic age, a world in turmoil, a world in need of comic relief. Later, he said "Maybe ... I was painting the woman in me. Art isn't a wholly masculine occupation, you know. I'm aware that some critics would take this to be an admission of latent homosexuality ... If I painted beautiful women, would that make me a non-homosexual? I like beautiful women. In the flesh—even the models in magazines. Women irritate me sometimes. I painted that irritation in the Woman series. That's all." Such ideas could not be expressed by pure abstraction alone.&lt;ref&gt;Scala, Ch 2. "The Influence of Anxiety" by Susan H. Edwards&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, however, see the Woman series as [[misogynistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unveiling the American Nude|last=Monaghan|first=Peter|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=Jan 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New York artists of this period retained the figure as their primary subject. [[Alice Neel]] painted nudes, including her own self-portrait, in the same straightforward style as clothed sitters,&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–155&lt;/ref&gt; being primarily concerned with color and emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, Chapter 2 - The Changing Room: Female Perspectives&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Pearlstein]] uses unique cropping and perspective to explore the abstract qualities of nudes. As a young artist in the 1950s, Pearlstein exhibited both abstracts and figures, but it was deKooning that advised him to continue with figurative work.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, from feminist principles, [[Sylvia Sleigh]] painted a series of works reversing stereotypical artistic themes by featuring naked men in poses usually associated with women.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, pp.&amp;nbsp;221–223&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
[[File:Benefits Supervisor Sleeping.jpg|thumb|alt=Benefits Supervisor Sleeping|''[[Benefits Supervisor Sleeping]]'' (1995)&lt;br/&gt; ''"I paint people, not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be."''&lt;br/&gt;- [[Lucien Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8654734/Lucian-Freud-quotes.html| date=July 22, 2011| newspaper=The Guardian | title=Lucian Freud quotes| accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Lucien Freud]] was one of a small group of painters which included [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] who came to be known as "The School of London"; creating figurative work in the 1970s when it was unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/25/arts/the-school-of-london-mordantly-messy-as-ever.html|title=The School of London, Mordantly Messy as Ever|first=ALAN|last=RIDING|date=September 25, 1995|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of his life his works had become icons of the [[Post Modern]] era, depicting the human body without a trace of idealization, as in his series working with an [[Benefits Supervisor Sleeping|obese model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/feb/08/lucian-freud-national-portrait-gallery#/?picture=385691839&amp;index=5|title=Lucien Freud|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 November 2012|location=London|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Freud's works is entitled "Naked Portrait", which implies a realistic image of a particular unclothed woman rather than a conventional nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/freud-naked-portrait-t01972|title=Naked Portrait 1972-3|publisher=The Tate Modern|accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Freud's obituary in ''The New York Times'', it is stated: His "stark and revealing paintings of friends and intimates, splayed nude in his studio, recast the art of portraiture and offered a new approach to figurative art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lucian Freud, Figurative Painter Who Redefined Portraiture, Is Dead at 88|newspaper=The New York Times|first=William|last=Grimes|date=Jul 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings of [[Jenny Saville]] include family and self-portraits among other nudes; often done in extreme perspectives, attempting to balance realism with abstraction; all while expressing how a woman feels about the female nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/jenny_saville.htm|title=Jenny Saville|publisher=Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Yuskavage]]'s nude figures painted in a nearly academic manner constitute a "parody of art historical nudity and the male obsession with the female form as object".&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Currin]] is another painter whose work frequently reinterprets historic nudes.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily Brown]]'s paintings combine figurative elements and abstraction in a style reminiscent of de Kooning.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marlene Dumas]] paints emotionally challenging images derived from her own snapshots or from photographs found in news magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Dumas says of her paintings of nude figures that "it was not the nude I was looking for, nor the posing figure, but the erotic conditions of life ... Two 'subjects' confronting each other."&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, M., Bedford, E., South African National Gallery., &amp; Standard Bank Centre Art Gallery. (2007). ''Marlene Dumas: Intimate relations''. Johannesburg: Jacana Media. p. 43. {{ISBN|978-1-77009-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the twentieth century saw the rise of new media and approaches to art, although they began much earlier. In particular [[installation art]] often includes images of the human body, and [[performance art]] frequently includes nudity. "Cut Piece" by [[Yoko Ono]] was first performed in 1964 (then known as a "happening"). Audience members were requested to come on stage and begin cutting away her clothing until she was naked. Several contemporary performance artists such as [[Marina Abramović]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]] and [[Carolee Schneemann]] use their own nude bodies or other performers in their work.

===Drawing===
{{Main|Figure drawing}}
In art, a '''figure drawing''' is a study of the [[Human figure|human form]] in its various shapes and [[Human positions|body postures]], with line, form, and composition as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. 
A '''life drawing''' is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]]. Study of the human figure has traditionally been considered the best way to learning how to draw, beginning in the late Renaissance and continuing to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printmaking===
{{Main|Printmaking}}
Japanese prints are one of the few non-western traditions that can be called nudes, but they are quite different. The activity of communal bathing in Japan is portrayed as just another social activity, without the significance placed upon the lack of clothing that exists in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|List of engravings by Dürer}}

===Painting===
{{Main|Figure painting}}
Oil paint historically has been the ideal medium for depicting the nude. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. "Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
{{Main|Sculpture}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Nude model in sculpture studio, c. 1912.jpg|thumb|Model in a sculpture studio, c. 1912]] --&gt;
Due to its durability, it is in sculpture that we see the full, nearly unbroken history of the nude from the Stone Age to the present. Figures, usually of the naked female, have been found in the [[Balkans|Balkan region]] dating back to 7,000 BCE &lt;ref&gt;Gimbustas, Marija ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe: Myths and Cult Images'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to this day to be generated. In the Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture tradition nudes were frequently adorned with bracelets and jewelry that tended to "punctuate their charms and demarcate the different parts of their bodies much as developed musculature does in the male."&lt;ref&gt;Finn, David, essay by Vicki Goldberg, ''Nude Sculpture: 5,000 Years'', Harry N. Abrams Ltd., Publishers, New York,  2000. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
{{Main|Nude photography (art)}}
The nude has been a subject of photography almost since its invention in the nineteenth century.

===The naked and the nude===

While there is no single definition of fine art, there are certain generally accepted features of most definitions. In the fine arts, the subject is not merely copied from nature, but transformed by the artist into an [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and the philosophy of art|aesthetic]] object, usually without significant utilitarian, commercial ([[advertising]], [[illustration]]), or purely [[Decorative art|decorative]] purposes. There is also a judgement of taste; the fine art nude being part of [[high culture]] rather than [[middle brow]] or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Low Culture should not be confused with the [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow or Graffiti Art Movement]], which often uses nude images from popular culture but attempts to raise them to Fine Art.&lt;/ref&gt; However, judgements of taste in art are not entirely subjective, but include criteria of skill and [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] in the creation of objects, communication of complex and non-trivial messages, and [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Ch. 3 - ''What is Art?''&lt;/ref&gt; Some works accepted as high culture of the past, including much [[Academic art]], are now seen as imitative or sentimental&lt;ref&gt;King, Ross&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/kitsch.htm|title=Theories of Media, Keywords Glossary:kitsch | publisher=The University of Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern artists have continued to explore classical themes, but also more abstract representations, and movement away from idealization to depict people more individually. During most of the twentieth century, the depiction of human beauty was of little interest to modernists, who were concerned instead with the creation of beauty through formal means.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner pp. 44, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In the contemporary, or [[Postmodern art|Post-modern]] era, the nude may be seen as passé by many,&lt;ref&gt;Steinhart, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; however there are always artists that continue to find inspiration in the human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/147546-nude-freud-painting-in-17m-record-sale|title=Nude Freud painting in £17m record sale|publisher=Metro|accessdate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most often cited book on the nude in art history is ''The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form'' by Lord [[Kenneth Clark]], first published in 1956. The introductory chapter makes the most often-quoted distinction&lt;ref&gt;Nead, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; between the naked body and the nude. Clark states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations. This separation of the artistic form from the social and cultural issues remains largely unexamined by classical art historians.

One of the defining characteristics of the modern era in art is the blurring of the line between the naked and the nude. This likely first occurred with the painting ''[[La maja desnuda|The Nude Maya]]'' (1797) by Goya, which in 1815 drew the attention of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goya, F., Tomlinson, J. A., Calvo, S. F., Museo del Prado., &amp; National Gallery of Art (U.S.). (2002). ''Goya: Images of women''. Washington, D.C: National Gallery of Art. p. 228. {{ISBN|0-89468-293-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shocking elements were that it showed a particular model in a contemporary setting, with pubic hair rather than the smooth perfection of goddesses and nymphs, who returned the gaze of the viewer rather than looking away. (Goya then painted another version, with clothes.) Some of the same characteristics were shocking almost 70 years later when Manet exhibited his ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', not because of religious issues, but because of its modernity. Rather than being a timeless Odalisque that could be safely viewed with detachment, Manet's image was of a prostitute of that time, perhaps referencing the male viewers' own sexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Manet's Olympia: The Figuration of Scandal|author=Charles Bernheimer|journal=Poetics Today|volume=10|issue=2|date=Summer 1989|pages=255–277|publisher=Duke University Press|jstor=1773024|doi=10.2307/1773024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian and author, [[Frances Borzello]] says that contemporary artists are no longer interested in the ideals and traditions of the past, but confront the viewer with all the sexuality, discomfort and anxiety that the unclothed body may express, perhaps eliminating the distinction between the naked and the nude.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; [[Performance art]] takes the final step by presenting actual naked bodies as a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, Chapter 2 - Body Art: the Journey into Nakedness&lt;/ref&gt;

 ===Men, Women, and Children===

===Sexuality===
Kenneth Clark noted that sexuality was part of the attraction to the nude as a subject of art, stating "no nude, however abstract, should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of [[erotic]] feeling, even though it be only the faintest shadow—and if it does not do so it is bad art and false morals." According to Clark, the explicit temple sculptures of tenth-century India "are great works of art because their eroticism is part of their whole philosophy." Great art can contain significant sexual content without being [[obscene]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9&lt;/ref&gt; However sexually explicit works of fine art produced in Europe before the modern era, such as [[Gustav Courbet]]'s ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'', were not intended for public display.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Courbet's "L'origine du monde": The Origin without an Original|first=Linda|last=Nochlin|work=October|volume=37|year=1986|pages=76–86|publisher=The MIT Press|jstor=778520|doi=10.2307/778520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement of whether a particular work is artistic or [[pornographic]] is ultimately subjective and has changed through history and from one culture to another. Some individuals judge any public display of the unclothed body to be unacceptable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-gallery-visitor-attacks-gauguin-painting-officials-say/2011/04/03/AFoATUXC_story.html|title=National Gallery visitor attacks Gauguin painting|publisher=The Washington Post|author1=Smith, Timothy R.  |author2=Weil, Martin  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 3, 2011| accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others may find artistic merit in [[Erotic art|explicitly sexual]] images. Public reviews of art may or may not address the issue.&lt;ref name="Gopnik"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopnik|first=Blake|title=In Art We Lust|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/06/AR2009110600041_2.html|accessdate=2013-02-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public reaction versus the art world====
The nude, particularly the female body, has always been one of the more obvious subjects of work in museums. However, in the United States nudity in art is a controversial subject when public funding and display in certain venues brings the work to the attention of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Nead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nude in Contemporary Art|publisher=The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puritan history continues to impact the selection of artwork shown in museums and galleries. At the same time that any nude may be suspect in the view of many patrons and the public, art critics may reject work that is not either ironic or fetishistic, and therefore cutting edge. "Artists who refuse to assault the body with stylishly perverse psychological or physical deformations are usually dismissed as being hopelessly out of tune with today's art world."&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Works that celebrate the human body are likely to be seen as too erotic by one group, and kitsch by the other. According to Bram Dijkstra, attractive nudes by American artists have been relegated to storage by museums, with only rare special exhibits or publications in recent decades. Relatively tame nudes tend to be shown in museums, while works with shock value such as those by [[Jeff Koons#Made in Heaven series|Jeff Koons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2008/06/09/080609craw_artworld_schjeldahl|title=Funhouse:A Jeff Koons retrospective|first=Peter|last=Schjeldahl|date=June 9, 2008|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are shown in cutting-edge galleries. Dijkstra says the art world has devalued simple beauty and pleasure, although these values are present in art from the past and in many contemporary works.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explaining nudity in art to students====
When school groups visit museums, there are inevitable questions that teachers or tour leaders must be prepared to answer. The basic advice is to give matter-of-fact answers emphasizing the differences between art and other images, the universality of the human body, and the values and emotions expressed in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/citi/resources/Rsrc_001627.pdf|title=Body Language:How to Talk to Students about Nudity in Art|date=March 18, 2003|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the problems that might arise lead many teachers to avoid the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teacherartexchange/archive/Jan08/0010.html|title=Teach Art Exchange: Response to Nudity in Art Education|publisher=The Getty.edu|date=January 8, 2008|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions of youth===
{{further|Depictions of child nudity}}
[[File:Ragazzo nudo sulla spiaggia John Singer Sargent.jpg|thumb|''A Nude Boy on a Beach'' (1878) by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]

In classical works, children were rarely shown except for babies and [[putto|putti]]. Before the era of Freudian psychoanalysis, children were assumed to have no [[child sexuality|sexual feelings before puberty]], so naked children were shown as symbols of pure innocence. Boys often swam nude, and were shown doing so in paintings by [[John Singer Sargent]], [[George Bellows]], and others. Other images were more erotic, either symbolically or explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Ch. 5 - Retreat to the Dream&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, Ch. 2 - Representing the Young&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===

[[File:This Year Venuses Again (Daumier).jpg|thumb|alt=Lithograph by Honoré Daumier|''This year Venuses again...always Venuses!...as if there really were women built like that!'' (1864), lithograph by [[Honoré Daumier|Daumier]]]]

Men and women did not receive equal opportunities in nude training during the Renaissance. Female artists were not allowed access to nude models and could not participate in this part of the arts education. During this time period the study of the nude figure was something all male artists were expected to go through to become an artist of worth and to be able to create History Paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda. Women, Art and Power and Other Essays. Thames and Hudson, 1988. ProQuest. Web. 25 Sep. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Male nude: gods and warriors====
Academic art history tends to ignore the sexuality of the male nude, speaking instead of form and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of history, nude men represented martyrs and warriors, emphasizing an active role rather than the passive one assigned to women in art. [[Alice Neel]] and [[Lucien Freud]] painted the modern male nude in the classic reclining pose, with the genitals prominently displayed. [[Sylvia Sleigh]] painted versions of classic works with the genders reversed.

====Female nude: the Venus and Odalisques ====

The Greek goddesses were initially sculpted with drapery rather than nude. The first free-standing, life-sized sculpture of an entirely nude woman was the ''[[Aphrodite of Cnidus]]'' created ca. 360–340 BCE by [[Praxiteles]].&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"&gt;Rodgers, David and Plantzos, Dimitris. "Nude." ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. Retrieved 2 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The female nude became much more common in the later Hellenistic period.

Rarely seen during the Middle Ages, the female nude reappeared in Italy in the 15th century. Subsequently, eroticism became more emphatic in paintings such as [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (ca. 1510), which situated the reclining nude in an idyllic landscape, and [[Titian]]'s ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' series (ca. 1553–1556). These works inspired countless reclining female nudes for centuries afterwards.&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"/&gt; The annual glut of paintings of idealized nude women in the 19th-century [[Paris Salon]] was satirized by [[Honoré Daumier]] in an 1864 lithograph.

In the 19th century the [[Orientalism]] movement added another reclining female nude to the possible subjects of European paintings, the [[odalisque]], a slave or harem girl. One of the most famous was "The [[Grande Odalisque]]" painted by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/grand-odalisque.html|title=Ingres' La Grand Odalisque }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Lynda Nead, the female nude is a matter of containing sexuality; in the case of the classical art history view represented by Kenneth Clark, this is about idealization and de-emphasis of overt sexuality, while the modern view recognizes that the human body is messy, unbounded, and problematical.&lt;ref&gt;Nead, Part I - Theorizing the Female Nude&lt;/ref&gt; If a virtuous woman is dependent and weak, as was assumed by the images in classical art, then a strong, independent woman could not be portrayed as virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Ch. 3 - The "New Woman": Fading Flower or Scourge of Nature?&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern reinterpretations====
[[File:The Barricade by George Wesley Bellows - BMA.jpg|thumb|''[[The Barricade]]'' (1918), oil on canvas, by [[George Bellows]]. A painting inspired by an incident in August 1914 in which German soldiers used Belgian townspeople as [[human shields]].]]

Until the 1960s, art history and criticism rarely reflected anything other than the male point of view. The [[feminist art movement]] began to change this, but one of the first widely known statements of the political messages in nudity was made in 1972 by the art critic [[John Berger]]. In ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', he argued that female nudes reflected and reinforced the prevailing power relationship between females portrayed in art and the predominantly male audience. A year later [[Laura Mulvey]] wrote "[[Feminist film theory|Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]" stating the concept of the [[Gaze|male gaze]], which asserts that all nudes are inherently voyeuristic.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist art movement was aimed at giving women the opportunity to have their art reach the same level of notoriety and respect that men’s art received. The idea that women are intellectually inferior to men came from Aristotelian ideology and was heavily depended on during the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jacobs, Frederika H. “Woman's Capacity to Create: The Unusual Case of Sofonisba Anguissola.”'' Renaissance Quarterly,'' vol. 47, no. 1, 1994, pp. 74–101.&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed by [[Aristotle]] that during the process of procreation, men were the driving force. They held all creative power while women were the receivers. Women’s only role in reproduction was to provide the material and act as a vessel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This idea carried over into the image of the artist and the nude in art. The artist was seen specifically as a white male, and he was the only one who held the innate talent and creativity to be a successful professional artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This belief system was prevalent in nude art. Women were depicted as passive, and they did not possess any control over their image. The female nude during the Renaissance was an image created by the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;McDonald, Helen. ''Erotic Ambiguities: The female nude in art.'' Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an eroticized image that holds the heterosexual male desire.

In Jill Fields’ article “Frontiers in Feminist Art History”, Fields examines the feminist art movement and how they attempted to change the image of the female nude. She considers how the image of the female nude was created and how the feminist art history movement attempted to change the way the image of the female nude was represented. Derived from the Renaissance ideal of feminine beauty, the image of the female body was created by men and for a male audience. In paintings like [[Gustave Courbet|Gustave Courbet's]],'' The Origin of the World,'' and [[François Boucher|Francois Boucher's]], ''Reclining Girl'', women are expressed with open legs. This symbol implies that women are to be passive and they are an object to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer-Tugendhat, Daniela and Zanchi, Michael. “Art, Sexuality, and Gender Construction.” ''Art in Translation'', vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 361-382.&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist art history movement has aimed to change the way this image is perceived. The female nude has become less of an icon in Western art since the 1990s, but this decline in importance did not stop members of the feminist art movement from incorporating things like the “central core” image.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Jill. “Frontiers in Feminist Art History.” ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies,'' vol. 33, no. 2, June 2012, pp, 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This way of representing the nude female figure in art was focused on the fact that women were in control of their own image. The central image was focused on vulva related symbols. By incorporating new images and symbols into the female nude image in Western art, the feminist art history movement continues to try and dismantle the male-dominated art world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Intersectionality ====
The nude image in art has affected women of color in a different way than it has white women, according to [[Charmaine Nelson]]. The different depictions of the nude in art has not only instituted a system of controlling the image of women but it has put women of color in a place of other. The intersection of their identities, as Nelson asserts, creates a “doubly fetishized black female body.”&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color are not represented to the degree that white women are in nude art from the Renaissance to the 1990s, and when they are represented it is in a different way than white women. The Renaissance ideal of female beauty did not include black women. White women were represented as a sexual image, and they were the ideal sexual image for men during the Renaissance. White women, in most major works, did not have pubic hair. Black women normally did, and this created their image in an animalistic sexual way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson, Charmaine]]. "Coloured Nude: Fetishization, Disguise, Dichotomy." ''Racar''22.1-2 (1995): 97-107. ''ProQuest. ''Web. 17 Oct. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While the white women’s image became one of innocence and the idealized, black women were continually overtly sexualized.

===Social commentary===
The nude has also been used to make a powerful social or political statement. An example is ''The Barricade'' by George Bellows, which depicts Belgian citizens being used as human shields by Germans in World War I. Although based upon a report of a real incident in which the victims were not nude, portraying them so in the painting emphasizes their vulnerability and universal humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, pp.&amp;nbsp;246–247&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persepolis''' ({{lang-peo|𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿}}, {{transl|peo|Pārsa}}) was the ceremonial capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ({{nowrap|ca. 550–330 BCE}}). It is situated {{nowrap|60 km}} northeast of the city of [[Shiraz]] in [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]]. The earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BCE. It exemplifies the [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid style]] of architecture. [[UNESCO]] declared the ruins of Persepolis a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasargadae|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|year=2006|accessdate=26 December 2010|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The English word ''{{lang|en|Persepolis}}'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Persépolis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:Περσέπολις|Περσέπολις]]}}), a compound of ''Pérsēs'' ({{lang|grc|Πέρσης}}) and ''pólis'' ({{lang|grc|πόλις}}), meaning "the Persian city" or "the city of the Persians". To the ancient Persians, the city was known as ''Pārsa'' ({{lang-peo|[[wikt:𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿|𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿]]}}), which is also the word for the region of [[Persis|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, H.W. (1996) "Khotanese Saka Literature", in Ehsan Yarshater (ed), ''The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol III: The Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Periods'', Part 2 (reprint edition), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 1230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{cite book |title=Seven Wonders of the Ancient Middle East |author=Michael Woods, Mary B.

An inscription left by [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] prince [[Shapur Sakanshah]], the son of [[Hormizd II]], refers to the site as {{transl|pal|Sad-stūn}}, meaning "Hundred Pillars".&lt;ref name="Shahbaz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/capital-cities |first1=A.

Another name given to the site in the medieval period was {{transl|fa|Čehel Menār}}, literally meaning "Forty Minarets".&lt;ref name="Shahbaz"/&gt;

==Geography==
Persepolis is near the small river Pulvar, which flows into the [[Kor River|Kur River]].

[[File:Persepolis east side at spring.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Ruins of the "Palace of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]]", Persepolis. As is typical of Achaemenid cities, Persepolis was built on a (partially) artificial platform.]]

The site includes a 125,000&amp;nbsp;square meter terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly cut out of a mountain, with its east side leaning on [[Rahmat Mountain]]. The other three sides are formed by [[retaining wall]]s, which vary in height with the slope of the ground. Rising from {{convert|5-13|metres|abbr=off}} on the west side was a double stair. From there, it gently slopes to the top. To create the level terrace, depressions were filled with soil and heavy rocks, which were joined together with metal clips.

==History==
Archaeological evidence shows that the earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. [[André Godard]], the French archaeologist who excavated Persepolis in the early 1930s, believed that it was [[Cyrus the Great]] who chose the site of Persepolis, but that it was [[Darius I]] who built the terrace and the palaces. Inscriptions on these buildings support the belief that they were constructed by Darius. 

With [[Darius I]], the scepter passed to a new branch of the royal house. Persepolis probably became the capital of Persia proper during his reign. However, the city's location in a remote and mountainous region made it an inconvenient residence for the rulers of the empire. The country's true capitals were [[Susa]], [[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]]. This may be why the Greeks were not acquainted with the city until [[Alexander the Great]] took and plundered it.

[[File:Plan of Persepolis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Aerial architectural plan of Persepolis.]]

Darius I's construction of Persepolis were carried out parallel to those of the [[Palace of Darius in Susa|Palace of Susa]].&lt;ref name=Perrot&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrot|first1=Jean|title=The Palace of Darius at Susa: The Great Royal Residence of Achaemenid Persia|date=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848856219|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDimj7F2VVgC&amp;lpg=PA423|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gene R. Garthwaite, the Susa Palace served as Darius' model for Persepolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garthwaite|first1=Gene R.|title=The Persians|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405144001|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unG8_JqzYQQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA50|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius I ordered the construction of the [[Apadana]] and the Council Hall (''Tripylon'' or the "Triple Gate"), as well as the main imperial Treasury and its surroundings. These were completed during the reign of his son, [[Xerxes I]]. Further construction of the buildings on the terrace continued until the downfall of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;2002. Guaitoli. M.T., &amp; Rambaldi, S. ''Lost Cities from the Ancient World''. White Star, spa. (2006 version published by Barnes &amp; Noble. Darius I founded Persepolis in 500 BC as the residence and ceremonial center of his dynasty. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Greek historian [[Ctesias]] mentioned that Darius I's grave was in a cliff face that could be reached with an apparatus of ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Persepolis|title=Persepolis|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 519 BC, construction of a broad stairway was begun. The stairway was initially planned to be the main entrance to the terrace {{convert|20|metres|abbr=off}} above the ground. The dual stairway, known as the Persepolitan Stairway, was built symmetrically on the western side of the Great Wall. The 111 steps measured {{convert|6.9|metres|abbr=off}} wide, with treads of {{convert|31|cm|abbr=off}} and rises of {{convert|10|cm|abbr=off}}. Originally, the steps were believed to have been constructed to allow for nobles and royalty to ascend by horseback. New theories, however, suggest that the shallow risers allowed visiting dignitaries to maintain a regal appearance while ascending. The top of the stairways led to a small yard in the north-eastern side of the terrace, opposite the [[Gate of All Nations]].

Grey [[limestone]] was the main building material used at Persepolis. After natural rock had been leveled and the depressions filled in, the terrace was prepared. Major tunnels for sewage were dug underground through the rock. A large elevated water storage tank was carved at the eastern foot of the mountain. Professor Olmstead suggested the [[cistern]] was constructed at the same time that construction of the towers began.

The uneven plan of the terrace, including the foundation, acted like a castle, whose angled walls enabled its defenders to target any section of the external front. [[Diodorus Siculus]] writes that Persepolis had three walls with ramparts, which all had towers to provide a protected space for the defense personnel. The first wall was {{convert|7|metres|abbr=off}} tall, the second, {{convert|14|metres|abbr=off}} and the third wall, which covered all four sides, was {{convert|27|metres|abbr=off}} in height, though no presence of the wall exists in modern times.

===Function===
The function of Persepolis remains rather unclear. It was not one of the largest cities in Persia, let alone the rest of the empire, but appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex, that was only occupied seasonally; it is still not entirely clear where the king's private quarters actually were.  Until recent challenges, most archaeologists held that it was especially used for celebrating [[Nowruz]], the Persian New Year, held at the spring [[equinox]], and still an important annual festivity in modern Iran. The Iranian nobility and the tributary parts of the empire came to present gifts to the king, as represented in the stairway reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, Ali, ''Persepolis: Discovery and Afterlife of a World Wonder'', p. 53, 2012, Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|1614510334}}, 9781614510338, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KorZMqmTOJgC&amp;pg=PA53 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction===
After [[Wars of Alexander the Great#End of the Achaemenid Empire|invading Achaemenid Persia]] in 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] sent the main force of his army to Persepolis by the [[Royal Road]]. He [[Battle of the Persian Gate|stormed]] the "[[Persian Gates]]", a pass through modern-day [[Zagros Mountains]]. There [[Ariobarzanes of Persis]] successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. After being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of [[Thermopylae]]. After several months, Alexander allowed his troops to loot Persepolis.
[[File:Italian - Plate with Overhanging Edge - Walters 481364 - Obverse.jpg|thumb|Alexander the Great ordering Persepolis to be set on fire;  Italian plate, 1534 (although it may be a depiction of the burning of Rome by [[Nero]]).]]

Around that time, a fire burned "the palaces" or "the palace". Scholars agree that this event, described in historic sources, occurred at the ruins that have been now re-identified as Persepolis. From Stolze's investigations, it appears that at least one of these, the castle built by Xerxes I, bears traces of having been destroyed by fire. The locality described by [[Diodorus Siculus]] after [[Cleitarchus]] corresponds in important particulars with the historic Persepolis, for example, in being supported by the mountain on the east.

It is believed that the fire which destroyed Persepolis started from Hadish Palace, which was the living quarters of [[Xerxes I]], and spread to the rest of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.toiran.com/en/directory/shiraz-persepolis-339 | work=toiran.com | title=Persepolis | accessdate=2015-01-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205211047/http://www.toiran.com/en/directory/shiraz-persepolis-339 | archivedate=5 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if the fire was an accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] during the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]]. Many historians argue that, while Alexander's army celebrated with a [[symposium]], they decided to take revenge against the Persians.&lt;ref name="The Chronology"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chronology of Ancient Nations|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7661-8908-9|page=484|author=Sachau, C. Edward}} p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; If that is so, then the destruction of Persepolis could be both an accident and a case of revenge.

The ''[[Book of Arda Viraf|Book of Arda Wiraz]]'', a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] work composed in the 3rd or 4th century, describes Persepolis' archives as containing "all the [[Avesta]] and [[Zend]], written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink", which were destroyed. Indeed, in his ''Chronology of the Ancient Nations'', the native Iranian writer [[Biruni]] indicates unavailability of certain native Iranian historiographical sources in the post-Achaemenid era, especially during the [[Parthian Empire]]. He adds: "[Alexander] burned the whole of Persepolis as revenge to the Persians, because it seems the Persian King Xerxes had burnt the Greek City of Athens around 150 years ago. People say that, even at the present time, the traces of fire are visible in some places."&lt;ref name="The Chronology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al-Beruni and Persepolis|journal=Acta Iranica|volume=1|place=Leiden|year=1974|isbn=978-90-04-03900-1|pages=137–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, the event that caused the destruction of these texts may have resulted in the preservation of the [[Persepolis Administrative Archives]], which might otherwise have been lost over time to natural and man-made events.&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer 10-11"&gt;Wiesehöfer 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not affect what are now referred to as the ''Persepolis Fortification Archive'' tablets, but rather may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern fortification wall that preserved the tablets until their recovery by the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]]'s archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Henkelman 2008:Ch 2"&gt;Henkelman 2008:Ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire===
[[File:Persepolis east side-02 at spring.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Western side of the compound at Persepolis.]]
In 316 BC, Persepolis was still the capital of Persia as a province of the great [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian Empire]] (see Diod. xix, 21 seq., 46; probably after [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], who was living about 326). The city must have gradually declined in the course of time. The lower city at the foot of the imperial city might have survived for a longer time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/Iran/Fars/Persepolis.htm|title=Persepolis|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ruins of the Achaemenids remained as a witness to its ancient glory. It is probable that the principal town of the country, or at least of the district, was always in this neighborhood.

About 200 BC, the city of [[Istakhr|Estakhr]], five kilometers north of Persepolis, was the seat of the local governors. From there, the foundations of the second great Persian Empire were laid, and there Estakhr acquired special importance as the center of priestly wisdom and orthodoxy. The Sasanian kings have covered the face of the rocks in this neighborhood, and in part even the Achaemenid ruins, with their sculptures and inscriptions. They must themselves have been built largely there, although never on the same scale of magnificence as their ancient predecessors. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] knew as little about Estakhr as the Greeks had known about Persepolis, despite the fact that the Sasanians maintained relations for four hundred years, friendly or hostile, with the empire.

At the time of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim invasion of Persia]], Estakhr offered a desperate resistance. It was still a place of considerable importance in the first century of [[Islam]], although its greatness was speedily eclipsed by the new metropolis of [[Shiraz]]. In the 10th century, Estakhr dwindled to insignificance, as seen from the descriptions of [[Estakhri]], a native (c. 950), and of [[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 985). During the following centuries, Estakhr gradually declined, until it ceased to exist as a city.

[[Odoric of Pordenone]] passed through Persepolis on his way to [[China]] in 1320. In 1474, [[Giosafat Barbaro]] visited the ruins of Persepolis, which he incorrectly thought were of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical account of discoveries and travels in Asia |first=Hugh |last=Murray |authorlink=Hugh Murray (geographer) |location= Edinburgh |publisher=A.

His first written report on Persia, the ''Jornada'', was published in 1606.

In 1618, [[García de Silva Figueroa]], King [[Philip III of Spain]]'s ambassador to the court of [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]], the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] monarch, was the first Western traveler to correctly identify the ruins of Persepolis as the location of Persepolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Road to Babylon: Development of U.S. Assyriology|author=C.

The fruitful region was covered with villages until its frightful devastation in the 18th century; and even now it is, comparatively speaking, well cultivated. The Castle of Estakhr played a conspicuous part as a strong fortress, several times, during the Muslim period. It was the middlemost and the highest of the three steep crags which rise from the valley of the [[Kur]], at some distance to the west or northwest of the necropolis of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].

French voyagers [[Eugène Flandin]] and [[Pascal Coste]] are among the first to provide not only a literary review of the structure of Persepolis, but also to create some of the best and earliest visual depictions of its structure. In their publications in [[Paris]], in 1881 and 1882, titled ''Voyages en Perse de MM. Eugene Flanin peintre et Pascal Coste architecte'', the authors provided some 350 ground breaking illustrations of Persepolis.&lt;ref name=ali/&gt; French influence and interest in Persia's archaeological findings would not end until the time of [[Reza Shah]], when such distinguished figures as [[André Godard]] helped create Iran's first heritage museum.

Throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, a variety of amateur digging occurred at the site, in some cases on a large scale.&lt;ref name=ali&gt;Ali Mousavi, Persepolis in Retrospect: Histories of Discovery and Archaeological Exploration at the ruins of ancient Passch, Ars Orientalis, vol. 32, pp. 209-251, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scientific excavations at Persepolis were carried out by [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Erich Schmidt]] representing the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. They conducted excavations for eight seasons, beginning in 1930, and included other nearby sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc5.pdf] Ernst E Herzfeld, ''A New Inscription of Xerxes from Persepolis'', ''Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization,'' vol. 5, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip68.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''Persepolis I: Structures, Reliefs, Inscriptions'', Oriental Institute Publications, vol. 68, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip69.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''Persepolis II: Contents of the Treasury and Other Discoveries,'' Oriental Institute Publications, vol. 69, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip70.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''Persepolis III: The Royal Tombs and Other Monuments'', Oriental Institute Publications, vol. 70, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oic21.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''The Treasury of Persepolis and Other Discoveries in the Homeland of the Achaemenians'', Oriental Institute Communications, vol. 21, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Persian frieze designs at Persepolis.jpg|thumb|Achaemenid [[frieze]] designs at Persepolis.]]
Herzfeld believed that the reasons behind the construction of Persepolis were the need for a majestic atmosphere, a symbol for the empire, and to celebrate special events, especially the ''[[Nowruz]]''.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; For historical reasons, Persepolis was built where the Achaemenid dynasty was founded, although it was not the center of the empire at that time.

Excavations of plaque fragments hint at a scene with a contest between [[Herakles]] and [[Apollo]], dubbed ''A Greek painting at Persepolis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-hellenic-studies/article/div-classtitlea-greek-painting-at-persepolisdiv/434BDDF27731A3F6A1DF0874C1CBAA41|doi=10.2307/630751|year=1980|title=A Greek painting at Persepolis|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=100|pages=204–206|jstor=630751|last1=Roaf|first1=Michael|last2=Boardman|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Persepolitan architecture is noted for its use of the [[Persian column]], which was probably based on earlier wooden columns. Architects resorted to stone only when the largest [[Cedrus libani|cedars]] of [[Lebanon]] or [[teak]] trees of [[India]] did not fulfill the required sizes. Column bases and capitals were made of stone, even on wooden shafts, but the existence of wooden capitals is probable.

The buildings at Persepolis include three general groupings: military quarters, the treasury, and the reception halls and occasional houses for the King. Noted structures include the Great Stairway, the [[Gate of All Nations]], the [[Apadana]], the Hall of a Hundred Columns, the Tripylon Hall and the [[Tachara]], the Hadish Palace, the Palace of [[Artaxerxes III]], the Imperial Treasury, the Royal Stables, and the Chariot House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|author=Pierre Briant|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2002|pages=256–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Persepolis+military+quarter#v=onepage&amp;q=Persepolis%20military%20quarter&amp;f=false|isbn=9781575061207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruins and remains==
[[File:Lotus Achaemenid architecture.JPG|thumb|upright|Reliefs of [[Nymphaea|lotus flowers]] are frequently used on the walls and monuments at Persepolis.]]
Ruins of a number of colossal buildings exist on the terrace. All are constructed of dark-grey marble. Fifteen of their pillars stand intact. Three more pillars have been re-erected since 1970. Several of the buildings were never finished. F. Stolze has shown that some of the mason's rubbish remains.

Since the time of [[Pietro Della Valle]], it has been beyond dispute that these ruins represent the Persepolis captured and partly destroyed by [[Alexander the Great]].

Behind the compound at Persepolis, there are three sepulchers hewn out of the rock in the hillside. The facades, one of which is incomplete, are richly decorated with reliefs. About 13&amp;nbsp;km NNE, on the opposite side of the Pulvar River, rises a perpendicular wall of rock, in which four similar tombs are cut at a considerable height from the bottom of the valley. Modern-day Iranians call this place ''Naqsh-e Rustam'' ("Rustam Relief"), from the Sasanian reliefs beneath the opening, which they take to be a representation of the mythical hero [[Rostam]]. It may be inferred from the sculptures that the occupants of these seven tombs were kings. An inscription on one of the tombs declares it to be that of [[Darius I]], concerning whom [[Ctesias]] relates that his grave was in the face of a rock, and could only be reached by the use of ropes. Ctesias mentions further, with regard to a number of Persian kings, either that their remains were brought "to the Persians," or that they died there.

===Gate of All Nations===
{{main article|Gate of All Nations}}

The [[Gate of All Nations]], referring to subjects of the empire, consisted of a grand hall that was a square of approximately {{convert|25|m|ft}} in length, with four columns and its entrance on the Western Wall. There were two more doors, one to the south which opened to the Apadana yard and the other opened onto a long road to the east. Pivoting devices found on the inner corners of all the doors indicate that they were two-leafed doors, probably made of wood and covered with sheets of ornate metal.

A pair of [[lamassu]]s, bulls with the heads of bearded men, stand by the western threshold. Another pair, with wings and a ''Persian Head'' (''Gopät-Shäh''), stands by the eastern entrance, to reflect the power of the empire.

The name of Xerxes I was written in three languages and carved on the entrances, informing everyone that he ordered it to be built.

===The Apadana Palace===

[[File:Persepolis - statue of a mastiff.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Statue of a [[Mastiff|Persian Mastiff]] found at the [[Apadana]], kept at the [[National Museum of Iran|National Museum]], [[Tehran]].]]

[[Darius I]] built the greatest palace at Persepolis on the western side of platform. This palace was called the ''[[Apadana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gardens of Persia|author=Penelope Hobhouse|publisher=Kales Press|year=2004|pages=177–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AMFRyiAxZ6YC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=apadana+is+ayvan+in+achaemenid#v=onepage&amp;q=apadana%20is%20ayvan%20in%20achaemenid&amp;f=false|isbn=9780967007663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Kings used it for official audiences. The work began in 518 BC, and his son, Xerxes I, completed it 30 years later. The palace had a grand hall in the shape of a square, each side {{convert|60|m|ft}} long with seventy-two columns, thirteen of which still stand on the enormous platform. Each column is {{convert|19|m|ft}} high with a square Taurus (bull) and plinth. The columns carried the weight of the vast and heavy ceiling. The tops of the columns were made from animal sculptures such as two-headed  lions, eagles, human beings and cows (cows were symbols of fertility and abundance in ancient Iran). The columns were joined to each other with the help of [[oak]] and [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] beams, which were brought from [[Lebanon]]. The walls were covered with a layer of mud and [[stucco]] to a depth of 5&amp;nbsp;cm, which was used for bonding, and then covered with the greenish stucco which is found throughout the palaces.

Foundation tablets of gold and silver were found in two deposition boxes in the foundations of the Palace. They contained an inscription by Darius in [[Old Persian cuneiform]], which describes the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms, and is known as the DPh inscription:&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Persepolis : discovery and afterlife of a world wonder |date=2012 |pages=171-181 |url=https://archive.org/details/persepolis_discovery_and_afterlife_of_a_world_wonder/page/n195 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DPh inscription], also [https://ldsmag.com/the-gold-plates-of-king-darius/ Photographs of one of the gold plaques]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the western, northern and eastern sides of the palace, there were three rectangular [[portico]]s each of which had twelve columns in two rows of six. At the south of the grand hall, a series of rooms were built for storage. Two grand Persepolitan stairways were built, symmetrical to each other and connected to the stone foundations. To protect the roof from erosion, vertical drains were built through the brick walls. In the four corners of Apadana, facing outwards, four towers were built.

The walls were tiled and decorated with pictures of lions, bulls, and flowers. Darius ordered his name and the details of his empire to be written in gold and silver on plates, which were placed in covered stone boxes in the foundations under the Four Corners of the palace. Two Persepolitan style symmetrical stairways were built on the northern and eastern sides of Apadana to compensate for a difference in level. Two other stairways stood in the middle of the building. The external front views of the palace were embossed with carvings of the [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], the Kings' elite guards. The northern stairway was completed during the reign of Darius I, but the other stairway was completed much later.

The reliefs on the staircases allow one to observe the people from across the empire in their traditional dress,  and even the king himself, "down to the smallest detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garthwaite|first1=Gene R.|title=The Persians|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405144001|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unG8_JqzYQQC&amp;lpg=PA50|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apadana hoard]] is a hoard of coins that were discovered under the stone boxes containing the foundation tablets of the [[Apadana Palace]] in Persepolis.&lt;ref name="ACH"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zournatzi |first1=Antigoni |title=THE APADANA COIN HOARDS, DARIUS I, AND THE WEST |date=2003 |pages=1–28 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43580364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins were discovered in excavations in 1933 by [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Erich Schmidt]], in two deposits, each deposit under the two deposition boxes that were found. The deposition of this hoard is dated to circa 515 BCE.&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt; The coins consisted in eight gold lightweight [[Croeseid]]s, a [[tetradrachm]] of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], a stater of [[Aegina]] and three double-[[sigloi]] from [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt; The Croeseids were found in very fresh condition, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule.&lt;ref name="CHI"/&gt; The deposit did not have any [[Daric]]s and [[Sigloi]], which also suggests strongly that these coins typical of [[Achaemenid coinage]] only started to be minted later, after the foundation of the Apadana Palace.&lt;ref name="CHI"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=William Bayne |last2=Gershevitch |first2=I. |last3=Boyle |first3=John Andrew |last4=Yarshater |first4=Ehsan |last5=Frye |first5=Richard Nelson |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200912 |page=617 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;pg=PA618 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Throne Hall===
Next to the Apadana, second largest building of the Terrace and the final edifices, is the Throne Hall or the Imperial Army's ''Hall of Honor'' (also called the ''Hundred-Columns Palace''). This 70x70&amp;nbsp;square meter hall was started by [[Xerxes I]] and completed by his son [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] by the end of the fifth century BC. Its eight stone doorways are decorated on the south and north with reliefs of throne scenes and on the east and west with scenes depicting the king in combat with monsters. Two colossal stone bulls flank the northern portico. The head of one of the bulls now resides in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/highlights/animals.html |title=Oriental Institute Highlights |publisher=Oi.uchicago.edu |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I, the Throne Hall was used mainly for receptions for military commanders and representatives of all the subject nations of the empire. Later, the Throne Hall served as an imperial museum.

===Other palaces and structures===
Other palaces included the [[Tachara]], which was built under [[Darius I]], and the Imperial treasury, which was started by Darius I in 510 BC and finished by [[Xerxes I]] in 480 BC. The Hadish Palace of Xerxes I occupies the highest level of terrace and stands on the [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]]. The Council Hall, the Tryplion Hall, the Palaces of D, G, H, storerooms, stables and quarters, the unfinished gateway and a few miscellaneous structures at Persepolis are located near the south-east corner of the terrace, at the foot of the mountain.

===Tombs===
[[File:Artaxerses III tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], Persepolis.]]
It is commonly accepted that [[Cyrus the Great]] was buried in [[Pasargadae]], which is mentioned by [[Ctesias]] as his own city. If it is true that the body of [[Cambyses II]] was brought home "to the Persians," his burying place must be somewhere beside that of his father. Ctesias assumes that it was the custom for a king to prepare his own tomb during his lifetime. Hence, the kings buried at [[Naghsh-e Rostam]] are probably [[Darius I]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] and [[Darius II]]. [[Xerxes II of Persia|Xerxes II]], who reigned for a very short time, could scarcely have obtained so splendid a monument, and still less could the usurper [[Sogdianus]]. The two completed graves behind the compound at Persepolis would then belong to [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] and [[Artaxerxes III]]. The unfinished tomb, a kilometer away from the city, is debated to who it belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lK6l7oF_ccC&amp;lpg=PA956&amp;pg=PA956 | title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East| isbn=9781405189880| last1=Potts| first1=Daniel T| date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps that of [[Arses of Persia|Artaxerxes IV]], who reigned at the longest two years, or, if not his, then that of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] (Codomannus), who is one of those whose bodies are said to have been brought "to the Persians." Since [[Alexander the Great]] is said to have buried Darius III at Persepolis, then it is likely the unfinished tomb is his.

Another small group of ruins in the same style is found at the village of Haji Abad, on the Pulvar River, a good hour's walk above Persepolis. These formed a single building, which was still intact 900 years ago, and was used as the [[mosque]] of the then-existing city of [[Istakhr|Estakhr]].

===Ancient texts===
[[File:Cuneiform inscriptions from Persepolis by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|Babylonian version of an inscription of [[Xerxes I]], the "XPc inscription".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/xpc/? XPc inscription]&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|b}}]]

The relevant passages from ancient scholars on the subject are set out below:

:([[Diodorus Siculus|Diod.]] 17.70.1-73.2) 17.70 (1) ''Persepolis was the capital of the Persian kingdom. Alexander described it to the Macedonians as the most hateful of the cities of Asia, and gave it over to his soldiers to plunder, all but the palaces.'' (2) ''It was the richest city under the sun, and the private houses had been furnished with every sort of wealth over the years. The Macedonians raced into it, slaughtering all the men whom they met and plundering the residences; many of the houses belonged to the common people and were abundantly supplied with furniture and wearing apparel of every kind....''

:72 (1) ''Alexander held games in honor of his victories. He performed costly sacrifices to the gods and entertained his friends bountifully. While they were feasting and the drinking was far advanced, as they began to be drunken, a madness took possession of the minds of the intoxicated guests.'' (2) ''At this point, one of the women present, Thais by name and Attic by origin, said that for Alexander it would be the finest of all his feats in Asia if he joined them in a triumphal procession, set fire to the palaces, and permitted women's hands in a minute to extinguish the famed accomplishments of the Persians.'' (3) ''This was said to men who were still young and giddy with wine, and so, as would be expected, someone shouted out to form up and to light torches, and urged all to take vengeance for the destruction of the [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temple]]s.'' (4) ''Others took up the cry and said that this was a deed worthy of Alexander alone. When the king had caught fire at their words, all leaped up from their couches and passed the word along to form a victory procession [epinikion komon] in honor of Dionysius.''

:(5) ''Promptly, many torches were gathered. Female musicians were present at the banquet, so the king led them all out for the [[komos]] to the sound of voices and flutes and pipes, Thais the courtesan leading the whole performance.'' (6) ''She was the first, after the king, to hurl her blazing torch into the palace. As the others all did the same, immediately the entire palace area was consumed, so great was the conflagration. It was most remarkable that the impious act of Xerxes, king of the Persians, against the acropolis at Athens should have been repaid in kind after many years by one woman, a citizen of the land which had suffered it, and in sport.''

:(Curt. 5.6.1-7.12) 5.6 (1) ''On the following day, the king called together the leaders of his forces and informed them that "no city was more mischievous to the Greeks than the seat of the ancient kings of Persia . . . by its destruction they ought to offer sacrifice to the spirits of their forefathers."''...

:7 (1) ''But Alexander's great mental endowments, that noble disposition, in which he surpassed all kings, that intrepidity in encountering dangers, his promptness in forming and carrying out plans, his good faith towards those who submitted to him, merciful treatment of his prisoners, temperance even in lawful and usual pleasures, were sullied by an excessive love of wine.'' (2) ''At the very time when his enemy and his rival for a throne was preparing to renew the war, when those whom he had conquered were but lately subdued and were hostile to the new rule, he took part in prolonged banquets at which women were present, not indeed those whom it would be a crime to violate, but, to be sure, harlots who were accustomed to live with armed men with more licence than was fitting.''

:(3) ''One of these, Thais by name, herself also drunken, declared that the king would win most favor among all the Greeks, if he should order the palace of the Persians to be set on fire; that this was expected by those whose cities the barbarians had destroyed.'' (4) ''When a drunken strumpet had given her opinion on a matter of such moment, one or two, themselves also loaded with wine, agreed. The king, too, more greedy for wine than able to carry it, cried: "Why do we not, then, avenge Greece and apply torches to the city?"'' (5) ''All had become heated with wine, and so they arose when drunk to fire the city which they had spared when armed. The king was the first to throw a firebrand upon the palace, then the guests and the servants and courtesans. The palace had been built largely of cedar, which quickly took fire and spread the conflagration widely.'' (6) ''When the army, which was encamped not far from the city, saw the fire, thinking it accidental, they rushed to bear aid.'' (7) ''But when they came to the vestibule of the palace, they saw the king himself piling on firebrands. Therefore, they left the water which they had brought, and they too began to throw dry wood upon the burning building.''

:(8) ''Such was the end of the capital of the entire Orient''... .
:(10) ''The Macedonians were ashamed that so renowned a city had been destroyed by their king in a drunken revel; therefore the act was taken as earnest, and they forced themselves to believe that it was right that it should be wiped out in exactly that manner.''
:(Cleitarchus, [[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|FGrHist]]. 137, F. 11 (= Athenaeus 13. 576d-e))

:''And did not Alexander the Great have with him Thais, the Athenian hetaira? Cleitarchus speaks of her as having been the cause for the burning of the palace at Persepolis. After Alexander's death, this same Thais was married to Ptolemy, the first king of Egypt.''

There is, however, one formidable difficulty. [[Diodorus Siculus]] says that the rock at the back of the palace containing the royal sepulchers is so steep that the bodies could be raised to their last resting-place only by mechanical appliances. This is not true of the graves behind the compound, to which, as F. Stolze expressly observes, one can easily ride up. On the other hand, it is strictly true of the graves at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]]. Stolze accordingly started the theory that the royal castle of Persepolis stood close by Naqsh-e Rustam, and has sunk in course of time to shapeless heaps of earth, under which the remains may be concealed.

==Modern events==
In 1971, Persepolis was the main staging ground for the ''[[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500 Year Celebration of the Persian Empire]]'' under the reign of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It included delegations from foreign nations in an attempt to advance the [[Culture of Iran|Iranian culture]] and history.

===The controversy of the Sivand Dam===
Construction of the [[Sivand Dam]], named after the nearby town of [[Sivand]], began on 19 September 2006. Despite 10 years of planning, Iran's [[Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran|Cultural Heritage Organization]] was not aware of the broad areas of flooding during much of this time, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/23/iran.artsnews|title=Dam is threat to Iran's heritage|last=Vidal|first=John|date=2004-12-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is growing concern about the effects the dam will have on the surrounding areas of Persepolis.

Many archaeologists{{Who|date=May 2010}} worry that the dam's placement between the ruins of [[Pasargadae]] and Persepolis will flood both. Engineers involved with the construction deny this claim, stating that it is impossible, because both sites sit well above the planned waterline. Of the two sites, Pasargadae is considered the more threatened.

Archaeologists are also concerned that an increase in humidity caused by the lake will speed Pasargadae's gradual destruction. However, experts from the Ministry of Energy believe this would be negated by controlling the water level of the dam reservoir.

==Museums (outside Iran) that display material from Persepolis==

{{Hatnote|Not to be confused with ''Polish Professional Writers' Union'' created by [[Stefan Żeromski]], known in [[Polish language|Polish]] as Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich.}}

The '''Polish Writers' Union''' or the '''Union of Polish Writers''' ({{lang-pl|Związek Literatów Polskich}}, '''ZLP''') was established at a meeting of Polish writers and activists in [[Lublin]] behind the Soviet front line, during the liberation of [[Poland]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1944. Its initial name (Professional Union of Polish Writers) came from the similar organization formed in 1920 by renowned Polish novelist [[Stefan Żeromski]], called ''Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich'' which was deactivated during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="wiadomosci.wp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,title,Nowy-stary-prezes-Zwiazku-Literatow-Polskich,wid,13386712,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=1e760 | title=Nowy-stary prezes Związku Literatów Polskich | publisher=Wirtualna Polska | work=Wiadomości | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyklopedia.pwn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=4002321 | title=Związek Literatów Polskich | publisher=Encyklopedia PWN | work=Literatura i sztuka | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name was shortened to Polish Writers' Union at the 1949 conference in [[Szczecin]], in order to reflect the new government-imposed policy of [[Socialist realism in Poland]] advanced by the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish communist party]] of that period.&lt;ref name="bookinstitute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,78,1334.php | title=Związek Literatów Polskich (ZLP) | publisher=Instytut Książki, Poland | date=2012 | accessdate=May 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, the two official organs of ZLP were ''Twórczość'' monthly and the weekly ''Nowa Kultura''. After the [[Polish October|socialist revolution of 1956]] the Union became less of a political arm of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], and more of a true writers' organization devoted to creative output and the well-being of its members.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/61036,,,,zwiazek_literatow_polskich,haslo.html | title=Związek Literatów Polskich, ZLP | publisher=Encyklopedia WIEM | work=Literatura | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[communist Poland]], the ZLP was the only official representation of the country's literary community. In 1980, the Union consisted of 1,349 participants gathered in its 17 regional chapters.&lt;ref name="encyklopedia.pwn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=4002321 | title=Związek Literatów Polskich | publisher=Encyklopedia PWN | work=Literatura i sztuka | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an annual budget set by the state with numerous special funds and permits allowing for food [[Dietary supplement|supplement]]s, medical clinics, foreign travel, cars, vacations, [[stipend]]s and cash prizes for the inner circle. Its leaders lived a life of privilege, while some of the writers are known to have worked for [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|the secret police]], spying on others.&lt;ref name="klejnocki"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://klejnocki.wydawnictwoliterackie.pl/archiwum/03/2009/2/ | title=Związki pisarzy | publisher=Wydawnictwoliterackie.pl | work=Raptularz końca czasów | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | author=Jarosław Klejnocki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historia-zlp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.literaci.eu/index.php/historia-zlp.html | title=Historia Związku Literatów Polskich | publisher=''ZLP Literaci.eu'', Magazyn Związku Literatów Polskich | work=Homepage | date=March 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Martial law in Poland==
On 13 December 1981 the authoritarian government of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] introduced [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in an attempt to crush political opposition. Pro-democracy movements such as [[Solidarity]] were banned and their leaders detained. The Union of Polish Writers was suspended. Some of its [[dissident]] members were jailed and dozens blacklisted. At the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] Central Committee meeting the writers loyal to the new regime condemned the leaders of ZLP as disreputable.&lt;ref name="tygodnik.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/pisarz-literat-jednym-stoja-domu | title=Pisarz i literat w jednym stoją domu | publisher=Tygodnik PRZEGLĄD weekly | date=20/2005 | accessdate=May 18, 2012 | author=Helena Kowalik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union was disbanded in 1983. It was reinstated the same year by communist hardliners based on a new pledge of loyalty, which caused a deep rift in its highly politicized community. Many former members did not renew their cards.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tygodnik.pl" /&gt;

After the collapse of the Soviet union in 1989, the ZLP lost its state sponsorship.&lt;ref name="historia-zlp" /&gt; An alternative, new writers' union was also formed, called [[Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich]] (The Society of Polish Writers). As of now, both organizations have their headquarters at the ''Dom Literatury'' (Literary House) in [[Warsaw]] at ul. [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]] street, in a historic building which they own collectively.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tygodnik.pl" /&gt;

'''''Reptiles''''' is a [[Lithography|lithograph]] [[printmaking|print]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]] first printed in March 1943.

It depicts a desk upon which is a 2D drawing of a [[Tessellation|tessellated]] pattern of reptiles and hexagons. The reptiles at one edge of the drawing emerge into three dimensional reality, come to life and appear to crawl over a series of symbolic objects (a book on nature, a geometers triangle, a three dimensional/pentagonal dodecahedron, a pewter bowl containing a box of matches and a box of cigarettes) to eventually re-enter the drawing at its opposite edge.  Other objects on the desk that may also be symbolic are a potted cactus and yucca, a ceramic flask with a cork stopper next to a small glass of liquid, a book of JOB cigarette rolling papers, and an open handwritten note book of many pages. Although only the size of small lizards, the reptiles have protruding crocodile-like fangs, and the one atop the dodecahedron has a dragon-like puff of smoke billowing from its nostrils.

Like many of Escher's works, the meaning of the imagery is enigmatic. There are, however, a number of scholarly interpretations of the work. One is that the lizard represents man, emerging from pure concept in two dimensions, becoming a three dimensional being, groping through life acquiring knowledge and wisdom, arriving at deep understanding of science and sacred geometric principals and the alchemical/spiritual nature of reality and existence, and finally descending to reunion with the realm of pure concept. In this theory the objects around the edge of the drawing are signals of the stages of emergence (cactus, biological life), the beginning of the fire-quest for knowledge (rolling papers), contemplation and distillation (a jug and partially consumed glass of spirits), deep study, understanding and wisdom (the open well-used notebook), and re-integration (matches and cigarettes symbolizing controlled/civilized fire that nonetheless consumes and returns the physical to the abstract).

Once a woman telephoned Escher and told him that she thought the image was a "striking illustration of [[reincarnation]]".

==In popular culture==
A colorized version of the lithograph was used by rock band [[Mott the Hoople]] as the sleeve artwork for its [[Mott the Hoople (album)|eponymous first album]], released in 1969.

'''Rickshaw art''' or '''auto art''' is a form of [[neo-romanticism]] emerging in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

The art in question consists of [[oil painting]]s on the rear of the canvas roof of [[rickshaw]]s, done by local street artists, who also paint the various landscape, portraits and personal statements of the driver.

== History ==
In Bangladesh, rickshaw art dates back to the 1950s and every conceivable part of the rickshaw is painted. In addition to geometric designs, there are depictions of flowers, birds and even popular actresses. The rickshaw can be decorated to show the driver's religious beliefs and sometimes even a commentary on current social issues.&lt;ref&gt;RickshawArt.org [http://www.rickshawart.org''Website of the social entreprise RickshawArt in Bangladesh.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422102750/http://www.rickshawart.org/ |date=2017-04-22 }} Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangladesh, rickshaw art is looked down upon by the elite population.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|pages=479|isbn=0-7614-7631-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZBaVhmRvCkC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=rickshaw+art&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=rickshaw%20art&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-wheeled pedicab, more commonly known as the [[rickshaw]], has been around since the 1940s. Initially, they were undecorated, but starting in the late 1940s, the faces of movie stars began appearing as decorative motifs on shields at the back of the rickshaws along with a variety of floral paintings. The unique trend of rickshaw art started from [[Rajshahi]] and [[Dhaka]] in Bangladesh and took its own style in each district. For instance, [[Chittagong]] being a more pious city then Dhaka mostly had floral or scenery art whereas Comilla has plain rickshaws with beautiful dark blue or green hoods, on which are sewn an appliqué of a minaret or floral design enshrining the word "Allah".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Artwork on the wheels of the rickshaws are done using very bold, bright and raw colours, like fluorescent green, dark red and so on. The blaze of colours also help to make them long lasting. 

Author Joanna Kirkpatrick states her definition of rickshaw art: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider it "peoples' art". It is not necessary to force it into a unitary category as it combines folkloric, movie, political and commercial imagery and techniques. It serves the expression of heart's desires of the man in the street for women, power, wealth, as well as for religious devotion. Rickshaw art also serves prestige and economic functions for the people who make, use and enjoy it.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Kirkpatrick. [http://www.asianart.com/articles/ricksha/index.html ''Rickshaw Art in Bangladesh.''] Asian Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rickshaw art also reflects the [[economic globalization]] process, which is occurring all over the world today, for instance those rickshaws with Osama Bin Laden's pictures. Rickshaws are not only painted but also decorated with tassels, tinsel and colourful plastic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Rickshaw art covers the whole rickshaw decoration, from painted backboards and rear side panels to cut-outs appliquéd on to hoods, as well as brass vases replete with plastic or paper flowers. The painted rectangular metal board at the backside, between the two wheels, leaves a trail of passion that the Rickshaw artist puts in his creations.&lt;ref&gt;RickshawArt.org [http://www.rickshawart.org''Website of the social entreprise RickshawArt in Bangladesh.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422102750/http://www.rickshawart.org/ |date=2017-04-22 }} Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt;

This living pop art in Bangladesh is primarily created by illiterate rickshaw artists. They learn their techniques by living with Ustat (masters) from boyhood. They do not have copyrights, and in most cases are not attributed by name on their art. In the back of rickshaws however, there is generally a mark of the maker indicated by a bold steel pin, for example - "Fazlu Mistri". Today, rickshaw art and artists are in a 'struggle of existence'. Third and fourth generations are increasingly less interested in learning the art due to low incomes of two to three dollars a day as well as the lack of recognition.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Biskut Factory == 

As the genre of hand painted objects are dying down due to screen printing and other such technologies, a Bangladeshi artist called Biskut Abir, started his own art firm called Biskut Factory where he brought back rickshaw art and promoted it by hand painting on modern, innovative products. He uses patterns and colors from Rickshaw art and paints these vibrant images on sunglasses, clothes, shoes, phone cases and almost anything with a surface. His establishment is built on an artsy spirit and his love for rebelling against the system. Biskut lacks an academic background on designing or art, but has quite successfully proven that they can be redundant when talent persists. 

By selling and advertising his eye catching art through social media, Biskut has been extremely successful in amusing the youth and bringing back rickshaw art with a twist of modern art.

'''Shilin (Shihlin) Night Market''' ({{zh|c=士林夜市|p=Shìlín Yèshì}}) is a [[night market]] in [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], and is often considered to be the largest and most famous night market in the city.

==Overview==
The night market encompasses two distinct sections sharing a symbiotic relationship: a section formerly housed in the old Shilin Market building, containing mostly food vendors and small restaurants; and the surrounding businesses and shops selling other nonfood items. The food court holds 539 stalls, and the second floor serves as a parking lot for 400 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/10/14/175632|title=Shihlin vendors smell something fishy|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2002-10-14|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the food court, side streets and alleys are lined with storefronts and roadside stands. Cinemas, video arcades, and [[karaoke]] bars are also prevalent in the area. Like most night markets in Taiwan, the local businesses and vendors begin opening around 16:00. As students begin returning home from school, crowds reach their peak between 20:00 and 23:00. Businesses continue operating well past [[midnight]], closing around 01:00 or 02:00.

Tourist traffic has increased in recent years due to the opening of the [[Taipei Metro]] system. The night market is closest to [[Jiantan Station]] on [[Tamsui–Xinyi line]] (Tamsui/Red Line), and can be seen from the station platform.

==Historical development==
The night market is located near the former location of a [[wharf]] on the [[Keelung River]]. Agricultural produce from farms in Shilin being shipped to other ports such as [[Wanhua District|Banka]] and [[Dadaocheng]] would typically be sold in this area. The daytime Shilin Market was formally established in this area in 1909, and the market was inaugurated in 1913.&lt;ref name="reopen" /&gt; With the influx of customers, many new businesses and food vendors began to establish themselves in the area and the Shilin Night Market was born.

Shilin Night Market has since become the largest and most well-known night market in Taiwan, especially with regards to food, and is a favorite focal point for Taipei's [[nightlife (activity)|night life]] among residents and visitors alike.

Due to safety, sanitation and fire hazard concerns, the old Shilin Market structure was demolished in October 2002 by the Taipei City Government; the food vendors formerly based within the old structure were relocated to a newer temporary structure a few hundred meters away, next to the [[Taipei Metro|metro]] [[Jiantan Station]].&lt;ref name="ohmynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?article_class=5&amp;no=331023&amp;rel_no=1|title=

The renovated site re-opened in 2011.&lt;ref name="reopen"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20111208000096&amp;cid=1801 | title=Shilin Night Market to reopen at renovated site Christmas Day | newspaper=Central News Agency | date=2011-12-07 | access-date=2015-10-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004224752/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20111208000096&amp;cid=1801 | archivedate=2015-10-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Shilin Night Market is accessible via the Tamsui–Xinyi line (Taipei Metro) at Jiantan Station. A number of [[Taipei Joint Bus System|bus routes]] also serve the area with stops at Jiantan Station, nearby [[Ming Chuan University]], and Xiao Bei (Hsiao Pei) Street.

'''Spanish art'''  has been an important contributor to [[Western art history|Western art]] and Spain has produced many famous and influential artists including [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. Spanish art was particularly influenced by Italy and France  during the [[Baroque]] and [[neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods, but Spanish art has often had very distinctive characteristics, partly explained by the [[Moors|Moorish]] heritage in Spain (especially in [[Andalusia]]), and through the political and cultural climate in Spain during the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the subsequent eclipse of Spanish power under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty.

The [[prehistoric art]] of Spain had many important periods-it was one of the main centres of European [[Upper Paleolithic art]] and the [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin|rock art of the Spanish Levant]] in the subsequent periods. In the [[Iron Age]] north-western Spain was a centre for [[Celtic art]], and [[Iberian sculpture]] has a distinct style, partly influenced by coastal Greek settlements.  Spain was conquered by the Romans by 200 BC and Rome was rather smoothly replaced by the Germanic [[Visigoth]]s in the 5th century AD, who represented only a small ruling class, who soon Christianized.  The relatively few remains of [[Visigothic art and architecture]] show an attractive and distinct version of wider European trends, but the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim conquest of most of Spain]] in the 8th century was a massive disruption and transformation. Over the following centuries the wealthy courts of [[Al-Andaluz]] produced many works of exceptional quality, culminating in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], right at the end of Muslim Spain.

Meanwhile, the parts of Spain remaining Christian, or that were [[Reconquista|re-conquered]], were prominent in [[Pre-Romanesque]] and [[Romanesque art]], especially in [[Catalonia]]. Late Gothic Spanish art flourished under the unified monarchy in the [[Isabelline Gothic]] and [[Plateresque]] styles, and the already strong traditions in painting and sculpture began to benefit from the influence of imported Italian artists. The enormous wealth that followed the flood of American gold saw lavish spending on the arts in Spain, much of it directed at religious art in the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Spanish control of the leading centre of North European art, [[Flanders]], from 1483 and also of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] from 1548, both ending in 1714, had a great influence on Spanish art, and the level of spending attracted artists from other areas, such as [[El Greco]], [[Rubens]] and (from a safe distance) [[Titian]] in the [[Spanish Golden Age]], as well as great native painters such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[José de Ribera]], [[Francisco Zurbarán]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]].

[[Spanish Baroque architecture]] has survived in large quantity, and has both strains marked by exuberant extravagance, as in the [[Churrigueresque]] style, and a rather severe classicism, as in the work of [[Juan de Herrera]]. It was generally the former which marked the emerging art and [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] of the [[Spanish Empire]] outside Europe, as in Latin America ([[New Spanish Baroque]] and [[Andean Baroque]]), while the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines]] are simpler.  
The decline of the Habsburg monarchy brought this period to an end, and Spanish art in the 18th and early-19th century was generally less exciting, with the huge exception of Francisco Goya. The rest of 19th-century Spanish art followed European trends, generally at a conservative pace, until the Catalan movement of [[Modernisme]], which initially was more a form of [[Art Nouveau]].  Picasso dominates Spanish [[Modernism]] in the usual English sense, but [[Juan Gris]], [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Joan Miró]] are other leading figures.

==Ancient Iberia==
[[File:Torralba.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Talaiotic culture|Talaiotic]] town of Torralba den Salord site, [[Menorca|Menorca island]]]]
The early [[Iberians]] have left many remains; northern-western Spain shares with south-western France the region where the richest [[Upper Paleolithic art]] in Europe is found in the [[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain|Cave of Altamira and other sites]] where there are [[cave painting]]s made between 35,000 and 11,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;some are as old as 40,800 years old, according to "U-series dating of Paleolithic art in 11 caves in Spain", ''Science'', 2012 Jun 15 ;336(6087):1409-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] (as [[UNESCO]] term it) is from the eastern side of Spain, probably dating from about 8000-3500 BC, and shows animal and hunting scenes often developed with a growing feeling for the whole composition of a large scene.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Portugal]] in particular is rich in [[megalithic]] monuments, including the [[Almendres Cromlech]], and [[Iberian schematic art]] is stone sculpture, [[petroglyph]]s and [[cave painting]]s from the early metal ages, found all over the Iberian peninsula, with both geometric patterns, but also a higher usage of simple [[pictogram]]-like human figures than is typical of comparable art from other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Casco de Leiro]], a late [[Bronze Age]] gold ritual helmet, may relate to other [[golden hats]] found in Germany, and the [[Treasure of Villena]] is a huge hoard of geometrically decorated vessels and jewellery, perhaps from the 10th century BC, including 10 kilos of gold.

[[Iberian sculpture]] before the Roman occupation reflects the contacts with other advanced ancient cultures who set up small coastal colonies, including the Greeks and [[Phoenicians]]; the [[Sa Caleta Phoenician Settlement]] on [[Ibiza]] has survived to be excavated, where most now lie under large towns, and the [[Lady of Guardamar]] was excavated from another Phoenician site. The [[Lady of Elche]] (probably 4th century BC) possibly represents [[Tanit]], but also shows [[Hellenistic]] influence, as do the 6th century [[Sphinx of Agost]] and [[Biche of Balazote]]. The [[Bulls of Guisando]] are the most impressive examples of ''[[verraco]]s'', which are large [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] animal sculptures in stone; the 5th century BC [[Bull of Osuna]] is a more developed single example. Some decorated ''[[falcata]]'', the distinctive curving Iberian sword, have survived, and large numbers of bronze [[statuettes]] used as [[votive offering]]s.  The Romans gradually conquered all of Iberia between 218 BC and 19 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 13-21&lt;/ref&gt;

As elsewhere in the Western Empire, the Roman occupation largely overwhelmed native styles; Iberia was an important agricultural area for the Romans, and the elite acquired vast estates producing [[wheat]], [[olive]]s and wine, with some later emperors coming from the Iberian provinces; many huge villas have been excavated.  The [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], [[Roman Walls of Lugo]], [[Alcántara Bridge]] (104–106 AD), and the [[Tower of Hercules]] lighthouse are among a number of well-preserved major monuments, impressive remains of [[Roman engineering]] if not always art. [[Roman temple]]s survive fairly complete at [[Roman temple of Vic|Vic]], [[Roman Temple of Évora|Évora]] (now in Portugal), and [[Roman temple of Alcántara|Alcántara]], as well as elements in [[Temple of Augustus in Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Roman temple of Córdoba|Córdoba]].  There must have been local workshops producing the high-quality [[mosaic]]s found, though most of the better free-standing sculpture was probably imported.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 21-28&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] is an important [[Late Antique]] silver dish that was found in Spain but was probably made in [[Constantinople]].

== Early Medieval ==
[[File:CoronaRecesvinto01.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Detail of the [[votive crown]] of [[Recceswinth|Reccesuinth]], from the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], now in Madrid. The hanging letters spell  [R]ECCESVINTUS REX OFFERET [King R. offers this].&lt;ref&gt;The first R is held at the [[Musée de Cluny]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Christianized [[Visigoths]] ruled Iberia after the collapse of the Empire, and the rich 7th century [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], probably deposited to avoid looting in the [[Muslim Conquest of Spain]], is now a unique survival of Christian [[votive crown]]s in gold; though Spanish in style, the form was probably then used by elites across Europe. Other [[Visigothic art]] in the form of metalwork, mostly jewellery and buckles, and stone [[relief]]s, survives to give an idea of the culture of this originally barbarian Germanic people, who kept themselves very largely separate from their Iberian subjects, and whose rule crumbled when the Muslims arrived in 711.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 29-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The jewelled ''[[crux gemmata]]'' [[Victory Cross]], [[La Cava Bible]] and the [[Agate Casket of Oviedo]] are survivals from the 9-10th century of the rich [[Pre-Romanesque]] culture of the [[Asturias]] region in north-western Spain, which remained under Christian rule; the [[Santa María del Naranco]] banqueting house overlooking [[Oviedo]], completed in 848 and later surviving as a church, is a unique survival in Europe. The [[Codex Vigilanus]], completed in 976 in the region of [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], shows a complex mixture of several styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslim and Mozarab Spain==
[[File:Decoración de Medina Azahara (Córdoba, España).jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] panel from [[Medina Azahara]], [[province of Córdoba, Spain|province of Córdoba]]]]
The extraordinary palace-city of [[Medina Azahara]] near [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] was built in the 10th century for the [[Ummayads|Ummayad]] [[Caliphs of Córdoba]], intended as the capital of Islamic [[Andaluz]], and is still being excavated.  A considerable amount of the highly sophisticated decoration of the main buildings has survived, showing the enormous wealth of this very centralized state.  The palace at [[Aljafería]] is later, from after Islamic Spain split into a number of kingdoms.  Famous examples of [[Islamic architecture]] and its decoration are the [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba]], whose Islamic elements were added in stages between 784 and 987, and the [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] palaces in [[Granada]] from the final periods of Muslim Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 34-42, 47-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest known Islamic sculpture of an animal, and the most spectacular of a group of such figures from Al-Andalus, many made to hold up the basins of fountains (as at the Alhambra), or in smaller cases as perfume-burners and the like.

The Christian population of Muslim Spain (the Mozarabs) developed a style of [[Mozarabic art]] whose best known survivals are a series of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, several of the commentaries on the [[Book of Revelation]] by the Asturian Saint [[Beatus of Liébana]] (c. 730 – c. 800), which gave subject matter that allowed the brightly coloured primitivist style full scope to demonstrate its qualities in manuscripts of the 10th century like the  [[Morgan Beatus]], probably the earliest, the [[Gerona Beatus]] (illuminated by a female artist [[Ende (artist)|Ende]]), [[Escorial Beatus]] and the [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], which was actually produced some distance from Muslim rule in France.  Mozarabic elements, including a background of brightly coloured strips, can be seen in some later Romanesque frescos.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 53-59, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hispano-Moresque ware]] pottery began in the south, presumably mainly for local markets, but Muslim potters were later encouraged to migrate to the [[Valencia]] region, where the Christian lords marketed their luxury [[lustreware]]s to elites all over Christian Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, including the Popes and the English court.  Spanish Islamic [[ivory carving]] and textiles were also very fine; the continuing industries producing tiles and carpets in the peninsula owe their origins largely to the Islamic kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 43-44, 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

After the expulsion of the Islamic rulers during the [[Reconquista]], considerable Muslim populations, and Christian craftsmen trained in Muslim styles, remained in Spain, and [[Mudéjar]] is the term for work in art and architecture produced by such people.  The [[Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon]] is recognised as a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]], and the 14th century ''Patio de las Doncellas'' built for [[Peter of Castile]] in the [[Alcázar of Seville]] is another outstanding example.  The style could harmonize well with Christian European medieval and Renaissance styles, for example in elaborate wood and [[stucco]] ceilings, and Mudéjar work often continued to be produced for some centuries after an area passed to Christian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 188-197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

===Romanesque===
[[File:Santa maria tahull abside.jpg|thumb|The apse of [[Master of Taüll|Santa Maria Taüll]] church, a Catalan fresco from [[Vall de Boí]], [[province of Lleida]], early 12th century. Now in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]].]]

In Spain, the art of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period represented a smooth transition from the preceding Pre-Romanesque and Mozarabic styles. Many of the best surviving Romanesque church [[frescos]] that were at the time found all over Europe come from [[Catalonia]] with good examples in the churches of the [[Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí|Vall de Boí]] area; many of these were only uncovered during the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Walter W. S. Cook, ''Romanesque Spanish Mural Painting (I)'' from ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 11, No.4, Dec 1929, accessed from JSTOR:[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3050749]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the best examples have been moved to museums, especially the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona]], which has the famous [[Master of Taüll|Central Apse from Sant Climent in Taüll]] and the frescos from [[Sigena]].  The finest examples of [[Castile (historical region)|Castillian]] Romanesque frescoes are considered to be those in the [[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro]] in [[León, Spain|Leon]], the paintings from [[San Baudelio de Berlanga]], now mostly in various museums including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and those from [[Santa Cruz de Maderuelo]] in [[Segovia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Prado Guide, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also a number of [[altar frontal]]s painted on wood and other early [[panel painting]]s.

===Gothic===
The Gothic art of Spain represented a gradual development from previous Romanesque styles, being led by external models, first from France, and then later from Italy. Another distinctive aspect was the incorporation of [[Mudejar]] elements. Eventually the Italian influence, which transmitted Byzantine stylistic techniques and [[iconography]], entirely displaced the initial Franco-Gothic style&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Catalonia continued to be a prosperous area which has left many fine [[altarpiece]]s; however the region went into decline after the emphasis of trade moved to the Atlantic after the American colonies opened up, which partly accounts for so many medieval survivals there, as there was not the money for Renaissance and Baroque renovations to churches.

===Early Renaissance===
Due to important economic and political links between Spain and Flanders from the mid-15th century onwards, the early Renaissance in Spain was heavily influenced by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish painting]], leading to the identification of a [[Hispano-Flemish painting|Hispano-Flemish]] school of painters. Leading exponents included [[Fernando Gallego]], [[Bartolomé Bermejo]], [[Pedro Berruguete]] and [[Juan de Flandes]].

===Renaissance and Mannerism===
[[File:Luis de Morales - Pietà.jpg|thumb|left|''Pietà'', by [[Luis de Morales]]. [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], Seville.]]
Overall the Renaissance and subsequent Mannerist styles are hard to categorise in Spain, due to the mix of Flemish and Italian influences, and regional variations.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The main centre for Italian Renaissance influence entering Spain was [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] due to its proximity and close links with Italy. This influence was felt via then import of artworks, including four paintings by [[Piombo]] and many prints by [[Raphael]], the arrival of the Italian Renaissance artist [[Paolo de San Leocadio]],&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and also by Spanish artists who spent time working and training there. Such artists included [[Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina]] (1475&amp;ndash;1540) and [[Hernando de los Llanos|Fernando Llanos]], who displayed [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonadesque]] features in their works, such as delicate, melancholic expressions, and [[sfumato]] modelling of features.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in Spain, the influence of the Italian Renaissance was less pure, with a relatively superficial use of techniques that were combined with preceding Flemish practices and incorporated [[Mannerist]] features, due the relatively late examples from Italy, once Italian art was already strongly Mannerist.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from technical aspects, the themes and spirit of the Renaissance were modified to the Spanish culture and religious environment. Consequently, very few classical subjects or female nudes were depicted, and the works frequently exhibited a sense of pious devotion and religious intensity – attributes that would remain dominant in much art of [[Counter Reformation]] Spain throughout the 17th century, and beyond.
artists included [[Vicente Juan Masip]] (1475&amp;ndash;1550) and his son [[Juan de Juanes]] (1510&amp;ndash;1579), the painter and architect [[Pedro Machuca]] (1490&amp;ndash;1550), and [[Juan Correa de Vivar]] (1510&amp;ndash;1566).
However, the most popular Spanish painter of the early 17th Century was [[Luis de Morales]] (1510?–1586), called by his contemporaries "The Divine", because of the religious intensity of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;The Prado Guide, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; From the Renaissance he also frequently used sfumato modeling, and simple compositions, but combined them with Flemish style precision of details. His subjects included many devotional images, including the ''Virgin and Child''.

=== Golden Age ===
[[File:Murillo immaculate conception.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]], ''Immaculate Conception of the Virgin (Soult)''. Museo del Prado.]]
The [[Spanish Golden Age]], a period of Spanish political ascendancy and subsequent decline, saw a great development of art in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown, ''The Golden Age of Painting in Spain''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The period is generally considered to have begun at some point after 1492 and ended by or with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, though in art the start is delayed until the reign of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] (1598-1621), or just before, and the end also delayed until the 1660s or later.  The style thus forms a part of the wider [[Baroque]] period in art, although as well as considerable influence from great Baroque masters such as [[Caravaggio]] and later [[Rubens]], the distinctive nature of the art of the period also included influences that modified typical Baroque characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Maravall, ''Culture of the Baroque: Analysis of a Historical Structure''. Minneapolis MN 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included influence from contemporary [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and the native Spanish tradition which give much of the art of the period an interest in naturalism, and an avoidance of the grandiosity of much Baroque art.  Important early contributors included [[Juan Bautista Maíno]] (1569&amp;ndash;1649), who brought a new naturalistic style into Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 64&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Ribalta]] (1565&amp;ndash;1628),&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 74&lt;/ref&gt; and the influential [[still life]] painter, [[Juan Sánchez Cotán|Sánchez Cotán]] (1560&amp;ndash;1627).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[El Greco]] (1541&amp;ndash;1614) was one of the most individualistic of the painters of the period,  developing a strongly Mannerist style based on his origins in the post [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[Cretan school]], in contrast to the naturalist approaches then predominant in Seville, Madrid and elsewhere in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works reflect the silvery-greys and strong colours of Venetian painters such as [[Titian]], but combined with strange elongations of figures, unusual lighting, disposing of perspective space, and filling the surface with very visible and expressive brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mostly active in Italy, particularly in Naples, [[José de Ribera]] (1591&amp;ndash;1652) considered himself Spanish, and his style is sometimes used as an example of the extremes of Counter-Reformation Spanish art. His work was very influential (largely through the circulation of his drawing and prints throughout Europe) and developed significantly through his career.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 76, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Being the gateway to the [[New World]], [[Seville]] became the cultural centre of Spain in the 16th Century, and attracted artists from across Europe, drawn by lure of commissions for the growing empire, and for the numerous religious houses of the wealthy city.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from a strongly Flemish tradition of detailed and smooth brushwork, as revealed in the works of [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564&amp;ndash;1642), over time a more naturalistic approach developed, with the influence of [[Juan de las Roelas|Juan de Roelas]] (c. 1560&amp;ndash;1624) and [[Francisco Herrera the Elder]] (1590&amp;ndash;1654). This more naturalistic approach, influenced by [[Caravaggio]], became predominant in Seville, and formed the training background of three Golden Age masters: Cano, Zurbarán and Velázquez.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Zurbarán]] (1598&amp;ndash;1664) is known for the forceful, realistic use of [[chiaroscuro]] in his religious paintings and [[still life]]s. Although seen as limited in his development, and struggling to handle complex scenes. Zurbarán's great ability to evoke religious feelings made him very successful in receiving commissions in conservative Counter-Reformation Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing the same painting master - Francisco Pacheco - as Velázquez, [[Alonso Cano]] (16601&amp;ndash;1667) was also active in sculpture and architecture. His style moved from the naturalism of his early period, to a more delicate, idealistic approach, revealing [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] and [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 90&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Velázquez ===
[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Velázquez]], ''[[Las Meninas]],'' 1656–57. Museo del Prado.]]
[[Diego Velázquez]] (1599–1660) was the leading artist in the court of King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he created scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners. In many portraits, Velázquez gave a dignified quality to less fortunate members of society like beggars and dwarfs. In contrast to these portraits, the gods and goddesses of Velázquez tend to be portrayed as common people, without divine characteristics. Besides the forty portraits of Philip by Velázquez, he painted portraits of other members of the royal family, including princes, infantas (princesses), and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown, ''Velázquez: Painter and Courtier''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later Baroque ===
[[File:'Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets', by Luis Meléndez.jpg|thumb|px|upright| ''Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets'', by [[Luis Egidio Meléndez]]]]
Later Baroque elements were introduced as a foreign influence, through visits to Spain by [[Rubens]], and the circulation of artists and patrons between Spain and the Spanish possessions of [[Naples]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Significant Spanish painters taking up the new style were [[Juan Carreño de Miranda]] (1614&amp;ndash;1685), [[Francisco Rizi]] (1614&amp;ndash;1685) and [[Francisco de Herrera the Younger]] (1627&amp;ndash;1685), son of [[Francisco de Herrera]] the Elder an initiator of the naturalist emphasis of the [[Seville School]]. Other notable Baroque painters were [[Claudio Coello]] (1642&amp;ndash;1693), [[Antonio de Pereda]] (1611&amp;ndash;1678), [[Mateo Cerezo]] (1637&amp;ndash;1666) and [[Juan de Valdés Leal]] (1622&amp;ndash;1690).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 132-139&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-eminent painter of the period - and most famous Spanish painter prior to the 19th century appreciation of Velázquez, Zurbarán and El Greco - was [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] (1617&amp;ndash;1682).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Working for most of his career in Seville, his early work reflected the naturalism of Caravaggio, using a subdued, brown palette, simple but not harsh lighting,  and religious themes that are portrayed in a natural or domestic setting, as in his ''Holy Family with a Little Bird '' (c. 1650).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Later he incorporated elements of the [[Flemish Baroque]] from Rubens and Van Dyck. In the ''Soult Immaculate Conception'', a brighter and more radiant colour range is used, the swirling cherubs bringing all the focus upon the Virgin, whose heavenward gaze and diffuse and warmly glowing halo make it an effective devotional image, an important component of his output; the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin theme alone was represented about twenty times by Murillo.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century ===
The beginning of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] in Spain under [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] led to great changes in art patronage, with the new French-oriented court favoring the styles and artists of Bourbon France. Few Spanish painters were employed by the court – a rare exception being [[Miguel Jacinto Meléndez]] (1679–1734) – and it took some time before Spanish painters adapted to the new [[Rococo]]  and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. Leading European painters, including [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], were active and influential.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricted from royal sponsorship, many Spanish painters continued the Baroque style in religious compositions. This was true of [[Francisco Bayeu y Subias]] (1734–1795), a skilled fresco painter, and of [[Mariano Salvador Maella]] (1739–1819) who both developed in the direction of the severe Neoclassicism of Mengs.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Another important avenue for Spanish artists was portraiture, which was an active sphere for [[Antonio González Velázquez]] (1723–1794), [[Joaquín Inza y Ainsa|Joaquín Inza]] (1736–1811) and [[Agustín Esteve]] (1753–1820).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; But it is in the genre of the still life that royal patronage was also successfully found, in the works by artists such as the court painter [[Bartolomé Montalvo]] (1769–1846)&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luis Egidio Meléndez]] (1716–1780).

Continuing in the Spanish still life tradition of [[Juan Sánchez Cotán|Sánchez Cotán]] and Zurbarán, Meléndez produced a series of cabinet paintings, commissioned by the [[Prince of Asturias]], the future [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]], intended to show the full range of edible foods from Spain. Rather than being merely formal studies in Natural History, he used stark lighting, low viewpoints and severe compositions to dramatise the subjects. He showed great interest and attention to the details of reflections, textures and highlights (such the highlight on the patterned vase in ''Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets'') reflecting the new spirit of the age of [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goya ===
[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|220x220px|''[[The Rape of Europa (Francisco de Goya)|The rape of Europa]] (El rapto de Europa),'' [[Francisco Goya]]]]
[[Francisco Goya]] was a portraitist and court painter to the Spanish Crown, a chronicler of history, and, in his unofficial work, a revolutionary and a visionary. Goya painted the Spanish royal family, including [[Charles IV of Spain]] and [[Ferdinand VII]]. His themes range from merry festivals for tapestry, draft cartoons, to scenes of war, fighting and corpses. In his early stage, he painted draft cartoons as templates for tapestries and focused on scenes from everyday life with vivid colors. During his lifetime, Goya also made several series of "grabados", etchings which depicted the decadence of society and the horrors of war. His most famous painting series are the ''[[Black Paintings]]'', painted at the end of his life. This series features works that are obscure in both color and meaning, producing uneasiness and shock.

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the [[Old Master]]s and the first of the moderns.

===19th Century ===
{{See also|Costumbrismo}}
[[File:Juana la Loca de Pradilla.jpg|right|thumb|Frederico Pradilla, ''Doña Juana La Loca'' (''[[Juana of Castile|Joan the Mad]]''). Museo del Prado.]]
Various art movements of the 19th Century influenced Spanish artists, largely through them undertaking training in foreign capitals, particularly in Paris and Rome. In this way [[Neo-classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]] became important strands. However, they were often delayed or transformed by local conditions, including repressive governments, and by the tragedies of the [[Carlist Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pp. 196, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Portraits and historical subjects were popular, and the art of the past - particularly the styles and techniques of Velázquez - were significant.

Early years were still dominated by the [[academicism]] of [[Vicente López y Portaña|Vincente López]] (1772&amp;ndash;1850) and then the Neoclassicism of the French painter, [[Jacques-Louis David]], as in the works by [[José de Madrazo]] (1781&amp;ndash;1859), the founder of an influential line of artists and gallery directors. His son, [[Federico de Madrazo]] (1781&amp;ndash;1859), was a leading figure in Spanish Romanticism, together with [[Leonardo Alenza]] (1807&amp;ndash;1845),
[[Valeriano Bécquer]] and [[Antonio María Esquivel]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pp. 196-200&lt;/ref&gt;

The later part of the century saw a strong period of Romanticism represented in history paintings, as in the works of [[Antonio Gisbert]] (1834&amp;ndash;1901), [[Eduardo Rosales]] (1836&amp;ndash;1873) and [[Francisco Pradilla]] (1848&amp;ndash;1921). In these works the techniques of Realism were frequently used with Romantic subjects. This can clearly be seen in ''Joan the Mad'', a famed early work by Pradilla. The composition, facial expressions, and stormy sky reflect the dramatic emotion of the scene; yet the precise clothing, the texture of the mud, and other details, show great realism in the artist's attitude and style.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariano Fortuny (painter)|Mariano Fortuny]](1838&amp;ndash;1874) also developed a strong Realist style, after earlier being influenced by the French Romantic [[Eugène Delacroix]], and became Spain's famous artist of the century&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joaquín Sorolla - Chicos en la playa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Joaquín Sorolla]], ''Children on the beach'', 1910, Prado]]
The [[Valencia Province|Valencian]] 
[[Joaquín Sorolla]] (1863&amp;ndash;1923) excelled in the dexterous representation of the people and landscape under the sunlight of his native land, thus reflecting the spirit of [[Impressionism]] in many paintings, particularly his famous seaside paintings. In ''Children on the beach'' he makes the reflections, shadows and gloss of the water and skin his true subject. The composition is very daring, with the horizon omitted, one of the boys cut off, and strong diagonals leading to the contrasts and increased saturation of the upper-left of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th Century===
[[File:Juan Gris - Glass of Beer and Playing Cards.jpg|thumb|upright|px|[[Juan Gris]], ''Glass of Beer and Playing Cards'', 1913, [[Columbus Museum of Art]], Ohio]]
[[File:Picasso Signatur-DuMont 1977.svg|thumb|left|Signature of [[Pablo Picasso]].]]
During the first half of 20th Century many leading Spanish artists were working in Paris, where they contributed to - and sometimes led - developments in the [[Modernist art]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, pg 191&lt;/ref&gt;
As perhaps the most important example of this, [[Picasso]], working together with the French artist [[Braque]], created the concepts of [[Cubism]]; and the sub-movement of [[Cubism#Synthetic Cubism|Synthetic Cubism]] has been judged to have found its purest expression in the paintings and collages of Madrid-born [[Juan Gris]].&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, pg 80&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, [[Salvador Dalí]] became a central figure of the [[Surrealist]] movement in Paris; and [[Joan Miró]] was influential in abstract art.

[[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s Blue Period (1901–1904), which consisted of somber, blue-tinted paintings was influenced by a trip through Spain. The [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona features many of Picasso's early works, created while he was living in Spain, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabartés, Picasso's close friend from his Barcelona days who, for many years, was Picasso's personal secretary. There are many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as rarely seen works from his old age that clearly demonstrate Picasso's firm grounding in classical techniques. Picasso presented the most durable homage to Velázquez in 1957 when he recreated ''[[Las Meninas (Picasso)|Las Meninas]]'' in his characteristically [[cubist]] form. While Picasso was worried that if he copied Velázquez's painting, it would be seen only as a copy and not as any sort of unique representation, he proceeded to do so, and the enormous work—the largest he had produced since ''Guernica'' in 1937—earned a position of relevance in the Spanish canon of art. [[Málaga]], Picasso's birthplace, houses two museums with significant collections, the [[Museo Picasso Málaga]] and [[Fundación Picasso|Birthplace Museum]].
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:The Persistence of Memory.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Salvador Dalí]], ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', 1931]] --&gt;

[[Salvador Dalí]] was a central artist within the [[Surrealist]] movement in Paris. Although Dalí was criticized for accommodating [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime, [[André Breton]], the Surrealist leader and poet, asked him to represent Spain at the 1959 [[Homage to Surrealism Exhibition]] which celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Surrealism. In line with the Surrealist movement's objectives, Dalí stated that his artistic aim was that "...the world of imagination and of concrete irrationality may be as objectively evident ... as that of the exterior world...",&lt;ref&gt;From Rubin ''Dada, Surrealism and Their Heritage'' pg. 111 (quoted in Gardner, pg. 984)&lt;/ref&gt; and this goal can be seen in one of his most familiar paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pg. 984&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]''. Here he paints with a precise, realistic style, based on studies of Dutch and Spanish masters,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner pg. 985. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; but with a subject that dissolves the boundaries between organic and mechanical and is more akin to the nightmarish scenes of the Netherlandish painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]], whose ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' provided the model for the central, sleeping figure of Dalí's work.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Miro2.jpg|thumb|left|px|Joan Miró, ''La Leçon de Ski'', 1966, Sofia Imber Contemporary Art Museum of [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]]] --&gt;

[[Joan Miró]] was also closely associated with the Surrealists in Paris, who particularly approved of his use of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] in composition and execution, designed to expose the subconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pg. 985&lt;/ref&gt; Although his later and more popular paintings are refined, whimsical and apparently effortless, his influential period in the 1920s and 1930s produced works that were provocative in their sexual symbolism and imagery, and employing rough, experimental materials, including sandpaper, unsized canvases, and collage.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Hubert Martin, foreword of ''Joan Miró - Snail Woman Flower Star'', pg. 7, Prestel, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In mature period painting, ''La Leçon de Ski'', his characteristic language of signs, figures and black linear forms against more textured and painterly background is evident.

[[Ignacio Zuloaga]] and [[José Gutiérrez Solana]] were other significant painters of the first half of 20th century.

===Post WW2===

In the post-War period, the Catalan artist [[Antoni Tàpies]] became famous for his abstract works, many of which use very thick textures and the incorporation of non-standard materials and objects. Tàpies has won several international awards for his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2025&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate website, quoting: Ronald Alley, ''Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists'', Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp. 714–15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Sepulcro de la reina Leonor de Aragón, esposa de Juan I, rey de Castilla y León, y madre de Enrique III de Castilla y León, y de Fernando I el de Antequera, rey de Aragón. Catedral de Toledo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sepulcher of Elanor of Aragon, in the Cathedral of Toledo.]]
The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time.
[[Alonso Berruguete]] (sculptor, painter and architect) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture" because of the grandeur, originality, and expressiveness achieved in his works.
His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality.

Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolomé Ordóñez]], [[Diego de Siloé]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Damià Forment|Damián Forment]].
[[File:Alonso Cano, San Juan Bautista, 1634.jpg|thumb|px|left|upright|[[Saint John the Baptist (Alonso Cano)|''Saint John the Baptist'']], by [[Alonso Cano]] from the province of Valladolid. Now in the [[Museo Nacional de Escultura, Valladolid|National Museum of Sculpture of Castile and León]], Valladolid.]]
Another period of Spanish Renaissance sculpture, the Baroque, encompassed the last years of the 16th century and extended into the 17th century until reaching its final flowering the 18th, developing a truly Spanish school and style, of sculpture, more realistic, intimate and independently creative than that of the previous one which was tied to European trends, especially those of the Netherlands and Italy. There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] belonged (called the Sevillian Fidias), whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.

Another notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Roldán]]  and his daughter [[Luisa Roldán]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]].

The Valladolid school of the 17th century ([[Gregorio Fernández]], [[Francisco del Rincón]]) was succeeded in the 18th century, although with less brilliance, by the Madrid School, and it was soon transformed into a purely academic style by the middle of the century. In turn, the Andalusian school was replaced by that of Murcia, epitomised in the person of [[Francisco Salzillo]], during the first half of the century. This last sculptor is distinguished by the originality, fluidity, and dynamic treatment of his works, even in those representations of great tragedy. More than 1,800 works are attributed to him, the most famous products of his hand being the Holy Week floats (pasos) in Murcia, most notable amongst which are those of the Agony in the Garden and the Kiss of Judas.

In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]] and [[Pablo Serrano]].

==Spanish collectors and museums of art==
{{See also|Golden Triangle of Art}}

Spanish monarchs beginning with Isabel the Catholic, Queen of Castile (1451–1504), who accumulated large and impressive collections of objets d'art, 370 tapastries, and 350 paintings, a number by important artists including [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[Juan de Flandes]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado''. New York: Harry N. Adams, Inc. 1996, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isabel's grandson, Charles I of Spain, the first Hapsburg king of Spain,  was a patron and collector of art, as was his sister, Mary of Hungary. Both admired works by [[Titian]]. When the siblings died, the art passed to Philip II of Spain, Charles's son.&lt;ref&gt;Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip IV (1605–1665) followed in the family tradition as a passionate art collector and patron.  During his reign, [[Velázquez]], [[Zurbarán]] and others produced many works of art. Philip commissioned works and purchased others, sending his representatives to acquire works for the monarch's collection.  One of Philip IV's major contributions to art in Spain was to entail his collection, preventing their sale or other dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado'', pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the Spanish Bourbon monarch, Charles IV, the notion of bringing together major works from other repositories in Spain took shape, probably not for the public to view but for artists to study.&lt;ref&gt;Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prado Museum]] in Madrid became the main repository for that art. 

The [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Francisco]], founded in 1744, now functions also as a museum in Madrid. The [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museum of the Americas]] in Madrid has a collection of [[casta]] paintings and other art brought back to Spain from the Americas, as well as sculpture and archeological artifacts.

{{no footnotes|date=September 2015}}

The '''''Star Trek'' expanded universe''' is an unofficial, fan-created term to describe an extrapolation of events which occur in the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' Universe]] outside the scope of the television series and feature films.  Information from the ''Star Trek'' "Expanded Universe" typically fills "holes" in the ''Star Trek'' story and timeline, with explanations of events which have never been adequately explained through live action productions.  The term was first used in 1966 by writer D.C. Fontana to describe information put forth in the backstory of Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]].

Although original ''Star Trek'' fiction (for adult audiences) dates back to [[James Blish]]'s 1970 novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', published by [[Bantam Books]], the publishing company [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] is most directly responsible for contributing to the ''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe through its license with [[Pocket Books]] which has generated a large number of ''Star Trek'' novels over the past twenty-five years.  Information in the novels, while sometime contradictory, often serves to provide information to the ''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe.

The term "''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe" is not an official usage of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], or any other ''Star Trek'' licensee.  The term is occasionally used within fandom by analogy with the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] as defined by [[Lucasfilm]].  However, the policies and practices pertaining to licensed Star Trek fiction are not identical to those used by Lucasfilm.  For example, unlike in ''Star Wars'' fiction, there is no overall effort among the various licensees to integrate all ''Star Trek'' fiction into a single continuity.  Although the majority of ''Star Trek'' novels in recent years have been written to be consistent with one another and with certain ''Star Trek'' comic books, they remain incompatible with many earlier novels and comics, and occasionally with contemporary novels as well.

Many of these premises have been accepted by ''Star Trek'' fans as being [[canon (fiction)|canon]], even though [[Paramount Pictures]], owners of the ''Star Trek'' franchise, considers only live-action television and film productions to be canon.  This has led to conflict on occasion when a TV episode or film contradicts well-established Expanded Universe backstory (most notably in the case of the prequel series, ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').

==Expanded premises==
* '''Leonard McCoy's Backstory''':  [[Leonard McCoy]] was married shortly before obtaining his medical degree.  Starting a private practice, McCoy fathered a daughter before being divorced by his wife and losing custody of his child.  Sometime after 2260, he closed his medical practice and accepted a staff officer's commission in [[Starfleet]] to escape the pain of losing his wife and daughter.
* '''Second Five Year Voyage of the USS ''Enterprise''''':  Following the events of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' the ''Enterprise'' embarked on a second five-year mission of exploration.  [[James T. Kirk]] did not regain his rank of [[rear admiral]] but chose to remain a [[captain]] to command the ''Enterprise''.  The aborted television series ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' was to have been set during this second five-year mission, and there remains a "gap" between the first and second ''Trek'' feature films that suggests such a mission ''might'' have occurred, though this has never been confirmed in any canonical resource.  It should be noted that stories that are set in this timeframe do not necessarily conform to any known episode storyline that was planned for ''Phase II''.
* '''Chekov's Promotion History and Later Life''':  [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] Chekov was promoted to [[lieutenant junior grade]] at the conclusion of the first five-year voyage of the ''Enterprise''.  By 2271, he was a full [[lieutenant]].  He obtained the rank of [[lieutenant commander]] during the second five-year voyage of the ''Enterprise'' and, in 2276, was promoted to [[commander]] and assigned as the executive officer of the USS ''Reliant''.  He appeared apparently as a retired commander in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', but later novels and fan sources from ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' indicate that he eventually became an admiral.  [[Walter Koenig]] also has been quoted as saying at science fiction conventions that he speculates often if Chekov is in some way related to [[Worf]]'s adoptive Russian parents.
*'''Physical Appearance of the Romulans''':  The ruling class Romulans of the 23rd century were referred to unofficially as Romulans of the "Smooth Brow".  These Romulans were direct descendants of the original Vulcan dissidents that left Vulcan circa AD&amp;nbsp;1 (Earth Calendar).  By the mid-24th century, the Smooth Brow Romulans had lost most of the power on Romulans to be replaced by standard Romulans who, through centuries of inbreeding and off-world marriages, had developed very pronounced forehead ridges.  These Romulans occupied most positions of power in the 24th century government and military; however, the Romulans of the Smooth Brow could still be found in the public light.  Commander Sela, a Romulan-Human cross, was often mistaken by fellow Romulans as a Smooth Brow.  Ambassador Spock was also able to infiltrate Romulan society by posing as a Smooth Brow Romulan.
*'''The Riker-Troi Romance Backstory''':  Although various hints have appeared in sundry ''Next Generation'' episodes, only the novel ''[[Imzadi]]'' actually told the whole story of how Riker and Troi originally met and fell in love - and of what came between them.
*'''Further Adventures of the ''Deep Space Nine'' crew''':  After the disappearance of [[Benjamin Sisko]] and the conclusion of the war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]], the planet [[Bajor]] joins the Federation.  [[Kira Nerys]] is given permanent command of the station and a [[Starfleet]] commission of [[captain]].  Many new crew members join DS9, including [[Elias Vaughn]] (the station's new [[executive officer]], and commander of the [[USS Defiant (NX-74205)|''Defiant'']]), [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] [[Thirishar ch'Thane]] (the new [[Andorian]] science officer), [[Lieutenant]] [[Sam Bowers (Star Trek)|Sam Bowers]] (tactical), and others.  Sisko eventually returns to corporeal existence and moves with his family to Bajor. (See [[Deep Space Nine relaunch]] for further information.)
* '''James T. Kirk's resurrection''':  Shortly after ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', William Shatner and co-writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens wrote a series of novels taking place after the events in the movie, bringing [[James T. Kirk]] back from the dead, much like mainstream comic books.  While the novels are not mentioned in regular continuity, they are often read by fans who felt Kirk had died an "unheroic" death and deserved something more.  Many fans accept these novels into their own [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] continuity (or at least choose to accept [[The Return (Shatner novel)|''The Return'']] only, the most important and commercially successful of the novels).  In these, Kirk is venturing in the 24th century, while falling in love again, having a child, getting along with [[Spock]], [[Leonard McCoy]] and, also temporally misplaced, [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]], while also getting himself into new adventures with them, and developing a nice friendship with [[Jean Luc Picard]].  They even take a vacation trip together, in ''[[The Captain's Peril]]'', shortly after the Dominion War's end, a few months prior to ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.  Critics cite an overdone focus on Kirk as the glorified hero, often leaving Picard and others in downplayed roles.  These novels, which are not considered part of the overall continuity of the other ''Star Trek'' novels, are collectively referred to by fans as the "Shatnerverse."&lt;br&gt;''[[Star Trek: New Voyages]]'', also uses the idea of Kirk living on in that both released episodes feature possible futures, The pilot "Come What May" features a scene where Kirk sees his possible future.  This includes most of the more famous movie scenes (Spock's death, and parts of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'') and then Spock speaking the works "Captain Kirk is alive" just ''after'' a repeat of Kirk's last line in ''Generations''.  In addition episode one ("In Harm's Way") features Kirk and Spock traveling back in time to help their younger selves; the year they come from is given as 2373, or two years after Kirk's "death" (and roughly the time period Shatner's third novel ''Avenger'' gives for Kirk's reappearance on the Galactic stage).
* '''Charles 'Trip' Tucker's life''':  In "[[These Are the Voyages... (Enterprise episode)|These Are The Voyages...]]", the final episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', [[Charles Tucker III|Charles 'Trip' Tucker]] is apparently killed defending his ship against alien pirates.  The latest ''Enterprise'' novel, ''Last Full Measure'', revealed in its final scenes that Trip actually survived the attack and lived on after the events of this episode.  It is unknown at present how Trip survived, who ordered that his death be faked, or why.  The ''Enterprise'' novels are currently undergoing a relaunch similar to that of ''DS9'', so it is possible that these questions may be answered.

==Disproved premises==
*'''Physical Appearance of the Klingons''':  The marked difference in the physical characteristics of the [[Klingon]]s, as seen in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and in later feature films and television productions, was first explained as the result of a genetic engineering experiment which took place approximately between the year 2210 and 2270.  In an attempt to emulate humans, and make infiltration in human regions of space easier, the [[Klingon Empire]] merged human [[DNA]] with a large segment of its military force.  The result was the "Klingon-Human Fusions" who were the only Klingons permitted to have contact with the Federation.  By 2271, this attempt at creating Klingon-Human Fusions had been abandoned and the Empire abolished the project.  Certain high ranking Klingons (such as [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]], [[Koloth]] and [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]]) were permitted to undergo procedures to remove the human DNA from their cell structures and revert to a pure Klingon appearance.  To this day, the Klingon Empire considers the attempts at creating Klingon-Human Fusions to have been an embarrassment and it is "not discussed" with outsiders.  An alternate explanation was offered in the [[DC Comics]] [[graphic novel]], ''Debt of Honor'' which suggested the ridged Klingons were a different race than the human-like Klingons, which had suffered discommodation{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} at some point.  In a two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', aired in 2005 as "[[Affliction (Enterprise episode)|Affliction]]" and "[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]", this premise was disproved and it was revealed that the change in Klingon appearance was the result of a virus that resulted from military enhancement experiments.  Presumably a cure was found for the condition (which was passed from generation to generation) sometime prior to ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''.  Dr. Antaak had one line toward the end of "[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]" stating that perhaps he could specialize in cosmetic surgery.  This would explain how Kor, Koloth and Kang changed their appearance from smooth brow in ''The Original Series'' to cranial ridges in ''DS9''.  (The DC Comics premise was disproved much earlier by the appearance of Kor, Koloth and Kang (now with ridges) in the ''DS9'' episode "Blood Oath").
*'''Klingon Society''':  [[FASA]] Corporation's 1980s ''Star Trek'' role-playing game and supplements greatly expanded on Klingon society, enlisting the aid of the late ''Star Trek'' novelist [[John M. Ford]].  The version of the Klingon society in the 2260s was that of a paranoid society of both "human-fusion" and "Imperial Klingons", complete with sophisticated nomenclatures, a Klingon Emperor, "thought admirals" and an afterlife known as the "Black Fleet."  The home planet was known as "Klinzhai".  Most of these ideas were superseded in several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (and subsequent productions) which established the Klingon homeworld as "Qo'nos" (also spelled "Kronos") and the Klingon afterlife as [[Stovokor]].  Flag ranks in the Klingon fleet have been established (post-FASA) as both [[general]]s (such as [[Martok]] from ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'') and [[admiral]]s (''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').

==''The Animated Series''==
''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (''TAS'') was a 22 episode set of animated adventures of the ''Enterprise'' crew, which aired originally on [[NBC]] from 1973-1974. It featured the reappearance of popular characters from the original series, including [[Harry Mudd]] and [[Cyrano Jones]], and speculates on what happened to them after they were last seen in live-action. Some ''Star Trek'' novels and comics have utilized characters that were only ever seen in the animated series, most notably [[Arex]] and [[M'Ress]]. It has been suggested by fans that these stories took place during the fourth or fifth year of Kirk's original "five-year mission." Arguably, the most-debated element of ''TAS'' is the introduction of [[Robert April]] as the first captain of the ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701.

===Canon status===
From the show's debut up until the end of the first season of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', ''TAS'' was considered part of ''Star Trek'' canon. Then, from the end of the first season of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' on May 16, 1988 (when all licenses for [[Star Trek spin-off fiction|''Star Trek'' spin-off fiction]] were renegotiated) up to June 27, 2007, ''TAS'' was "decanonized". However, on June 27, 2007, ''Star Trek''{{'}}s official website incorporated information from ''TAS'' into its library, recanonizing it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9607">{{Other uses|Street Wars (disambiguation){{!}}Street Wars}}
'''StreetWars''' is a three-week-long [[water gun]] "assassination" tournament that travels to cities around the world. Created by Franz Aliquo and Liao Yutai, the tournament is based on the college and high school game [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]].

The June 2007 issue of [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'' magazine]] has an article written by one of the participants of the 2006 London Streetwar.

==History and background of the tournament==
The tournament is loosely based on the game [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]], popular among some high school and college students. Aliquo and Liao took the game citywide and opened it to anyone above the age of 18, and changed it to a 3 week long, 24/7 format. Featured in the book "Spray," by Harry Edge, as a tournament known as Water Wars, with different directors than the actual game.

The first StreetWars took place in the summer of 2004 in [[New York City]]; subsequent tournaments took place in [[Vancouver]] (2004), [[Vienna]] (2004), [[New York City]] (2005, 2006, 2008, 2009), [[San Francisco]] (2005, 2007, 2010), [[Los Angeles]] (2006), [[London]] (2006, 2007,2010), [[Chicago]] (2007), and [[Paris]] (2007).

==Controversy==
===Mayor Bloomberg blasts StreetWars===
In July 2005, when asked of his opinion on StreetWars, Mayor [[Mike Bloomberg]] of [[New York City]] said that the creators of StreetWars could probably 'use some psychiatric help'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/17576?page_no=1 Bloomberg Says Creator of StreetWars Could Probably 'Use Some Psychiatric Help'], [[New York Sun]], July 26, 2005. Accessed 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police concerns in London===
Before the start of the game in London in July 2006, police voiced concerns that the associated suspicious activities might lead to deployment of officers and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/5211998.stm Water pistol game 'irresponsible'], [[BBC]] online, 25 July 2006. Accessed 13 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shadow Government==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mustache-commander-protrait.jpg|frame|right|Mustache Commander]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mustache-commander-with-plumber.jpg|frame|thumb|right|Mustache Commander and Agent Plumber in the SF2005 game]] --&gt;
While StreetWars was created by Aliquo and Liao, the tournament itself is operated by an organization that calls itself "The Shadow Government", led by two mysterious figures known only as "Supreme Commander" and "Mustache Commander". His signature is a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], [[Cheongsam|mandarin gown]], [[pipe (material)|pipe]], bottle of [[Jack Daniel's|Jack Daniels]], and [[mustache]]. The "Mustache Commander" is the fictional alter ego of Yutai Liao, and the "Supreme Commander" – of Franz Aliquo.

Alter ego of StreetWars co-creator, Yutai Liao, Mustache Commander made his first appearance in StreetWars during the San Francisco 2005 game. Previous to the SF 2005 game, there has only been the Supreme Commander and the mysterious "Assigner".

The now famous giant bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] that greets each and every player at the beginning of every tournament, started with the second appearance of the Mustache Commander (the first was with his signature fedora), in an underground tunnel in Golden Gate Park in the SF 2005 tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetwars.net/media/Weekend_America2005-streetwars.mp3 The Warriors], radio show Weekend in America follows the Mustache Commander as he meets his players in an underground tunnel in San Francisco (links to an MP3 file)&lt;/ref&gt; The Mustache Commander is now often portrayed with a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] in hand.

== Critical Response ==
In ''The Asian Review of Books'', Nigel Collett called ''The Gurkha's Daughter'' a "promising debut", adding that Parajuly, "gets deep under the skin of his characters to reveal the often very difficult circumstances in which they live. I am aware of no other writer in English who has so vividly brought to life the dilemmas and constrictions of daily Nepalese life. The effect is poignant." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/new/?ID=1397#!&lt;/ref&gt;  Babatdor Dkhar of the ''Calcutta Telegraph'' referenced the initial buzz surrounding Parajuly's two-book deal, saying that fears he would not live up to expectation proved unfounded.  "Parajuly paints colourful landscapes of a world that forever has remained in the background. A world that made sense in the stereotype. A world whose characters come out of their small roles and make the starring ones their own. He brings to life the dreams, the everyday, the aspirations, the failures, love, the differences that add and the ones that remove." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130104/jsp/northeast/story_16399935.jsp#.UzNcVM6a_-K&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Lady'' magazine gave three stars to the collection, saying they were, "Stylistically reminiscent of Raymond Carver, while at the same time opening a door on to an unfamiliar world." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lady.co.uk/culture/books/1580-book-reviews-2-january?highlight=WyJ0aGUiLCJndXJraGEncyIsImRhdWdodGVyIiwic3RvcmllcyIsInRoZSBndXJraGEncyIsInRoZSBndXJraGEncyBkYXVnaHRlciIsImd1cmtoYSdzIGRhdWdodGVyIiwiZ3Vya2hhJ3MgZGF1Z2h0ZXIgc3RvcmllcyIsImRhdWdodGVyIHN0b3JpZXMiXQ==&lt;/ref&gt; John Garth in ''The Guardian'' has written a long review of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/25/gurkhas-daughter-prajwal-parajuly-review|title=The Gurkha's Daughter by Prajwal Parajuly – review|last=Garth|first=John|date=25 January 2013|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Indian Picture Opera''''' is a [[magic lantern]] [[slide show]] by photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]]. In the early 1900s, Curtis published the renowned 20-volume book subscription entitled '''''The North American Indian'''''. He compiled about 2400 photographs with detailed ethnological and language studies of tribes of the American West.

In 1911, in an effort to promote his book sales, Curtis created a traveling Magic Lantern slide show ''The Indian Picture Opera''.

Stereo-Opticon projectors put Curtis's stunning images on screens in America's largest cities.... one scene dissolving into another. A small orchestra played music derived from Indian chants and rhythms, and Edward Curtis lectured on the intimate stories of tribal life. 

This Magic Lantern show played to breathless audiences, stunned by the humanity, fascinated by the imagery, and shamed by the destruction of Indian cultures. The shows received standing ovations, and generous reviews.

Curtis went on to produce and direct ''[[In the Land of the Head Hunters]]'' in 1914. This production was a full-length documentary motion picture of aboriginal North Americans.

In 2006 there was a contemporary remake of the ''Picture Opera'', published on DVD. Following the original script, images and music were reconstituted into a modern-day multi-media production of ''The Indian Picture Opera''.

The '''''Odyssey Symphony''''' is [[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]'s second [[symphonic band]] [[symphony]].  Smith had studied both the [[Odyssey]] and [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy]] at Troy University.  

The symphony contains, in total, four movements, each being noted for having intricate and imaginitive percussive and wind effects.  They are as follows:

==Movement One:  "The Iliad"==
Subtitled "...in the 10th Year of the Trojan War", this piece retells the story of the incredible victory of the Greeks against the Trojans, using the famous "Trojan Horse".  The movement opens with call-and-response horn duet and motif that is prominent in both this and the fourth movement.  This quickly broadens into a majestic fanfare, another recurring theme in the piece, which in reality serves as a sort of theme for Odysseus.  The final sustained note of the fanfare decrescendoes into yet another motif:  a flute/horn duet backed by a harp (usually on synthesizer), playing their own call-and-response/echo theme.  The full band returns with the fanfare before entering an aggressive section:  the woodwinds play rapid alternating triplet patterns while the brass re-enter with an entirely new, even more menacing theme.  This new theme reaches its climax and quickly repeats its first part before a rapid woodwind descent which sets the tone for the second part of the movement, "The Trojan Horse".  Like in many of his pieces, Smith has used unusual percussion instruments and effects to achieve a certain mode and image.  In this piece, he has instructed the cymbal players to grind the edge of one cymbal into the inner dome of the other, producing the sound of the squeaky wheel.  While the Greeks wheel the horse into the city, the flute/duet melody returns briefly, highlighted by an ominous clarinet choir.  The music eventually fades away, and a second effect initiates:  The "Fire" effect involves members of the band crinkling paper gently while brake drums provoke a sword fight.  The "fire" quickly spreads across the band, eventually coming to the crescendo which reintroduces the "Aggressive" theme, albeit with  more triumphant feel.  This slightly-modified theme brings the band to its final, victorious climax.  If the band is transitioning to movement II, "The Winds of Poseidon", an optional ''fine'' is supplied, in which the flute/horn duet is repeated one more time with a different ending.

==Movement Two: "The Winds of Poseidon"==

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Movement Three: "The Isle of Calypso"==
This movement picks up with Odysseus lamenting as he is stranded on the strange island belonging to the goddess Calypso.  Here, he can have anything he wants, even immortality, but he is never truly happy, as he remembers that he promised his beloved Penelope that they would grow old and die together.  After a full year, Zeus and Hermes finally persuade the saddened Calypso to let Odysseus go free, so that he can once more rule Ithaca.  This song captures the hero's woes during his time on the island.

This lyrical piece, the emotional climax of the symphony, opens with a special "Clock" effect, which can be achieved in various ways (knocking pieces of wood back and forth against each other, amplifying the sounds of a real antique clock, etc.).  A prominent cymbal scrape leads to the entrance of an Ocean drum, while the piano begins the background theme.  A mournful English Horn solo introduces the main theme of the piece, and is soon joined by a euphonium duet and the rest of the winds.  The song reaches a fake climax, before descending back into the original English Horn melody.  A flashback to the flute/horn duet in the first movement is featured, and this leads into the buildup of the band.  Finally, the climax is reached, with "soaring" woodwind lines coupled by the brass/saxophone solo.  The band joins together for a final melancholy re-statement of the English horn solo, which resumes after a dramatic fermata.  Finally, this, too, lets go, and all that is left is the waves lapping on the shore (the ocean drum) the clock ticking away (the "Clock" effect) and the tolls of the clock bells (these can either be made by tubular bells, handbells, a synthesizer, or cut helium tanks).

==Movement Four: Ithaca==
The final movement of Symphony No. 2 sharply contrasts "The Isle of Calypso" in various ways, bringing about a conclusion to the work.  The piece opens with a tense, suspenseful piano/chimes/triangle trio, interrupted at certain points by the return of the English Horn from movement 3.  After a few seconds, the tense mood subsides as the ocean drums enter and a horn duo repeat the motif that opened the symphony itself.  However, this familiarity subsides almost as quickly as the tenseness of the opening, giving way to a dramatic brass melody.  The horns continue this melody, accentuated by blasts from the rest of the band, and then all parts crescendo into the upbeat, adventurous first section.  This section is made even more epic by the fact that various parts pass the melodies between them, from the horns and saxophones to the oboes to the euphoniums.  The entire section is constantly punctuated by "biting" brass lines and unique flute/piccolo melodies which soar over the rest of the melodies and draw them back into the original dramatic theme.  Finished off by a triumphant, very short fanfare, the sections decrescendo much like they did in movements 1 and 2 as the piece enters its second section.  Smith uses a spring drum, wind wands, and wind whistles to simulate the sound of a bow being strung and arrows being released, all topped off by repetitions of "Odysseus' Theme" (the horn duet).  As the winds whistles and wind wands continue playing, [[Bodhrán|bodhráns]] and brake drums simulate the sounds of battle, which lead into the third section.  The third section begins with a repeat of the "Aggressive" theme, once again modified, from the first movement.  Although the brass play a melody reminiscent of the first part of the song, a series of chromatic triplets lead the band back into the "Victorious" theme from movement 1.  As the chimes mimic the sound of "all the bells of Ithaca", the roaring fanfare that originally opened the symphony returns to close it, with a modified ending in which the whole band brings the song to a roaring conclusion.

==Notes==
* Like many of Smith's compositions, three of the four movements follow a distinct pattern:  an opening solo, followed by a fast theme, a slow theme, and another fast theme (similar to an overture).
*All four movements feature at least one distinct percussive effect that gives the piece added emotion.
*All four movements also begin and end in either the key of B-flat or its relative minor, with few key changes during the piece.
*In his programming notes, Mr. Smith acknowledges that the continuity of the piece compared to Homer's original epic has been altered slightly, with "The Winds of Poseidon" coming before "The Isle of Calypso".  He notes that he did this to provide further contrast between the mournful third movement and the action-filled fourth movement, and states that the order of the two middle movements may be switched should the conductor desire to do so.

==Percussive Effects==
# The Iliad
#; The "Groaning and Squeaky Wheel" effect
#: In order to simulate the giant Trojan Horse being wheeled into the city, two cymbals are placed in a perpendicular arrangement while the percussionist grinds the edge of one into the inner dome of the other. Two pairs of cymbals are scored in order to produce the sound of wheels on either end of the stage.
#; The "Fire" effect
#: As the city of Troy burns, the band softly crumples pieces of paper, "sweeping across the band" as necessary to produce a realistic "fire".
# The Winds of Poseidon
#; "Lightning" effect
#: Smith advises that an extra-large thundersheet be used during the first part of the second movement in order to enhance the effect of deep, rumbling thunder and flashing lightning.
#; "Siren" effect
#: When Odysseus hears the singing of the sirens, the percussion section uses toy "spinning tubes" cut to produce the B-flat, E-flat and F pitches in order to create an eerie effect.
# The Isle of Calypso
#; "Clock" effect
#: Used to symbolize the passing of time on Calypso's island, there are various ways of producing this effect. Smith suggests knocking a piece of wood between two wooden boxes with holes cut in them, or amplifying the ticking of an antique clock. The tolling of the bells may be produced by a set of chimes, a synthesizer, or even two helium tanks cut to sound a third apart.
# Ithaca
#; "Odysseus and the Arrow"
#: To produce the sound of arrows being released/flying by, the percussion section strikes a spring drum with a large triangle beater and bends a timpani pitch up as the bow is strung. When the arrows fly by, wind whistles and wind wands play in rapid succession, creating the illusion of arrows whizzing by at high speeds.

The Poor Old Lady by Lorenzo Jaramillo on the 1901 edition of the book Moral Tales for Formal Children by Rafael Pombo.|The Poor Old Lady by Lorenzo Jaramillo, 1901.]]
"'''The Poor Old Lady is a [[fairy tale]], best known in [[Latin America]].  It was first published in the book ''Moral Tales for Formal Children'' in 1854 by the [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[poet[Rafael Pombo]].  Due to the importance and impact of this play in [[Latin America]]n   children Latin American literature of the nineteenth century, "The Poor Old Lady" became one of the most memorable characters in the Colombian and Latin American childhood.  This paradoxical but amusing story is still reprinted in compilations of children stories and [[nursery rhyme]]s.

==Plot of the story==
"The Poor Old Lady" tells the story of a rich old lady who has everything (clothes, goods, food.).  However, in each verse of the story she is described as someone who complains about having nothing.  At the end, the poor old lady dies from all the alleged complications which she had.  In an ironic way the story ends with a particular phrase: “God grant that we can enjoy the poverty of that poor lady and die from the same ill.”

==Characters==
The story revolves around a unique character, the poor old lady, which is based on a commonly known social [[stereotype]].

==Commentary==
Like all tales and rhymes of [[Rafael Pombo]], "The Poor Old Lady" teaches children about everyday aspects of human beings and society.  Women and their insatiable desire to have many shoes and dresses,  and in a deeper layer this story deals with a main aspect: the human greed and exposes that material things are not the most important stuff in life.

The poor old lady explores 2 very basic human ensigns:

* ungratefulness and undermining of what she had 
* the constant see of what she lacks of. 

Negative or positive ensigns?
For many she was just a greedy lady that never noticed what she had was more than what many others had.
But we could imagine also that an old lady like her probably would have tried along her life all kind of drinks, and meals and shoes and beds and seats, which would have made of her a truly curious and exploratory person, perhaps insatiable.

| style="vertical-align: top" |&lt;poem&gt;The Poor old Lady

Once upon a time there was an old lady
With nothing to eat,
But meat, fruit, sweets,
Cakes, eggs, bread and fish.

She drank broth, chocolate,
Milk, wine, tea and coffee,
And the poor woman could not find
What to eat or what to drink.

And this old woman did not have
Not a little hut in where to live
But a large house
With its vegetables plot and its garden

No one, nobody cared for her
But Andrés and Juan Gil
And eight servants and two pages
with livery and bow-tie.

She never had anything to sit on
But chairs and sofas
With benches and cushions
And springs on the back.

Not another bed than a big one
More golden than an altar,
With soft feather mattress
A lot of silk and a lot of frills.

And this poor old lady
Every year, until her end,
She had one more year of age
And one year less to live.

And when looking herself in the mirror,
It always scared her there
Another old lady with glasses,
Little hat and a toupee.

And this poor old lady
Did not have what to dress,
But dresses of thousand styles
And of thousand and thousand fabrics.

And if not for his shoes,
Flip-flops, boots and booties,
Barefoot on the floor
was walking this wretch.

Appetite never had
When finishing eating,
Nor enjoyed complete health,
When she was unwell.

She died of wrinkle disease,
Already bent like a three,
And never complained again
Neither of hunger nor of thirst.

And this poor old lady
When she died, she left no more,
But money, jewels, lands, houses,
Eight cats and a turpial bird.

Rest in peace, and God allows
That we could enjoy
The poverty of that poor woman
And die as bad as she did.

----------------------------
La Pobre Viejecita

Érase una viejecita
Sin nadita que comer
Sino carnes, frutas, dulces,
Tortas, huevos, pan y pez

Bebía caldo, chocolate,
Leche, vino, té y café,
Y la pobre no encontraba
Qué comer ni qué beber.

Y esta vieja no tenía
Ni un ranchito en que vivir
Fuera de una casa grande
Con su huerta y su jardín

Nadie, nadie la cuidaba
Sino Andrés y Juan Gil
Y ocho criados y dos pajes
De librea y corbatín

Nunca tuvo en qué sentarse
Sino sillas y sofás
Con banquitos y cojines
Y resorte al espaldar

Ni otra cama que una grande
Más dorada que un altar,
Con colchón de blanda pluma,
Mucha seda y mucho olán.

Y esta pobre viejecita
Cada año, hasta su fin,
Tuvo un año más de vieja
Y uno menos que vivir

Y al mirarse en el espejo
La espantaba siempre allí
Otra vieja de antiparras,
Papalina y peluquín.

Y esta pobre viejecita
No tenía que vestir
Sino trajes de mil cortes
Y de telas mil y mil.

Y a no ser por sus zapatos,
Chanclas, botas y escarpín,
Descalcita por el suelo
Anduviera la infeliz

Apetito nunca tuvo
Acabando de comer,
Ni gozó salud completa
Cuando no se hallaba bien

Se murió del mal de arrugas,
Ya encorvada como un tres,
Y jamás volvió a quejarse
Ni de hambre ni de sed.

Y esta pobre viejecita
Al morir no dejó más
Que onzas, joyas, tierras, casas,
Ocho gatos y un turpial

Duerma en paz, y Dios permita
Que logremos disfrutar
Las pobrezas de esa pobre
Y morir del mismo mal&lt;/poem&gt;

|}

==Modern uses and adaptations==
The poor old lady is one of the most recognized characters of the [[Colombian culture]], and is commonly used in [[elementary school]] [[textbook]]s, [[nursery rhyme]]s, and [[Children's literature|child literature]] [[Anthology|compilation]]s.

In 1977, Fernando Laverde performed the [[Animation|animated film]] version of this story, which is considered the first animated film created in Colombia.

Representations of the character are used in [[parade]]s and [[carnival]]s.  In recent years, the theme parks Mundo Aventura and [[Colombian National Coffee Park]] have used [[animatronics]] versions of "The Poor Old Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Walrus |url=http://thewalrus78.blogspot.com/2009/12/la-pobre-viejecita-una-rareza-del-cine.html |title=I AM THE WALRUS: La Pobre Viejecita: Una Rareza del Cine Animado Colombiano |publisher=Thewalrus78.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibliotecasvirtuales.com/biblioteca/literaturainfantil/Poesiainfantil/RafaelPombo/ |title=Rafael Pombo |publisher=Bibliotecasvirtuales.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208131539/http://www.bibliotecasvirtuales.com/biblioteca/literaturainfantil/Poesiainfantil/RafaelPombo/ |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ninos/relatoi/rela3.htm |title=Rafael Pombo |publisher=banrepcultural.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">Most [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monasteries, temples and other religious structures in the [[Himalayas]] were decorated with '''Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings'''.  Despite much destruction in Tibet itself, many of these survive, the dry climate of the [[Tibetan plateau]] assisting their survival, as the wet Indian climate has reduced survival of paintings from there.  There are some regional differences, but the techniques described here cover the traditional wall paintings across this area. The wall paintings were executed on earthen plaster with the secco-technique.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, O.P. (ed.) (1989) "Wall Paintings - Asian Perspective. In: Wall Paintings of India- A Historical Perspective. Lucknow, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; A secco-technique is a painting technique in which the pigments with their binder are employed to paint onto a dry (Italian: secco) wall.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Detail wall painting, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|Detail wall painting, Ladakh]]
[[File:Wall painting ladakh.jpg|thumb|Detail of a wall painting in a Buddhist temple in Ladakh/India]]
[[File:1000 armed Avalokiteshvara at Saspol cave DSCN7053 1.jpg|thumb|1000 armed [[Avalokiteshvara]] dated 13th - 15th century AD at Saspol cave in  [[Ladakh]], [[India]] ]]
The support for wall paintings in made of [[earthen plaster]], usually consisting of more than one layer of earthen plaster, in which the last layer was rendered as smoothly as possible.
The support was covered by a smoothened ground, generally in white. Materials employed for the ground may be kaolin, chalk or gypsum, or any other white material deriving from an inert mineral.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S.( 2005) "A Technical Study of Early Buddhist Wall Paintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India." In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; 
To organise the painting, preliminary sketches were carried out. Generally this involved  the geometric layout of the design with the help of snapped lines and/or rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P., Jackson, J. A. (2006) ''Tibetan Thangka Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; Compasses were employed mainly for the construction of [[mandalas]]. Figures were roughly sketched, and then rendered with precise  contours. These outlines are usually in black.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S. (2005), "A Technical Study of the Early Buddhist Wall PAintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India". In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive designs were in some cases achieved with the use of [[stencils]].&lt;ref&gt;Lo Bue, E. (2006) "Tibetische Malerei." In: ''Tibet. Klöster öffnen ihre Schatzkammern''. (Exhibition catalogue. Museum für Asiatische Kunst. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.) Essen: Kulturstiftung Ruhr. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Traditionally, colour codes were employed to accelerate and simplify the colouring of the various ornaments and figures. For this purpose each section was given a number from 1-9 or an abbreviation of the name of the colour.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P, Jackson, J. A. (2006) "Tibetan [[Thangka]] Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Some paintings  were embellished with raised ornaments (pastiglia-technique).&lt;ref&gt;Dasser, K. L. (1996) "Some Observations on the Technology of the Wall Paintings in the Sumtsek. In: ''Alchi: Ladakh's Hidden Buddhist Sanctuary''. London: the Sumtsek, pp. 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt; Either a semi-liquid paste was applied to the painting surface, or a stamp had been previously produced from a mould and then applied onto the painting surface.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S. (2005), "A Technical Study  of the Early Buddhist Wall Paintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India". In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the final visible colour of a painting, specific colours for the underpainting were employed. An ochre for example has an underpainting in a bright yellow. Similar to Tibetan paintings, the traditional painting was carried out with shading systems, such as a dry or wet shading system.

'''''Varoom!''''' is a 1963 [[pop art]] painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that depicts an explosion and the [[onomatopoeic]] sound that gives it its name.

== Background ==
[[File:Varoom-Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|left|''Varoom'', 1965|150px]]
In the early- and mid-1960s Lichtenstein produced several of his most notable works, many with themes of war or romance, but others with themes of explosions or brushstrokes. Several of Lichtenstein's large-scale depictions of explosions, such as ''Varoom!'' are iconic.&lt;ref name="ArtDaily 2012-05-22"/&gt;
''Varoom!'' along with ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''[[Bratatat!]]'' are among Lichtenstein's most recognizable onomatopoeic works and was in a sense part of Lichtenstein's response to [[action painting]].
&lt;ref name="MrPorter 2013-02-12"/&gt;

Lichtenstein's list of aeronautically themed works is extensive. ''Varoom!'' is an explosion that is regarded as part of that theme.&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003"/&gt; ''Varoom!'', which depicts an instantaneous explosion, is composed of the [[primary color]]s presented over a light dotted background. Black and white specs add crackle to the composition. The block-lettered text, "VAROOM!", stands out, giving a title to the shattering event.&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003"/&gt;

In 1964, this painting served as the basis for the beginning of Lichtenstein's sculptural efforts, when he produced an enameled steel work that extended his theme of flatness. In 1965, he extended this theme to [[ceramic art]].&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weitmann 2002"/&gt;

Lichtenstein also created another painting entitled ''Varoom'' (no exclamation point, 1965).&lt;ref name="ID 1046"/&gt;

== Critical appraisal ==

''Varoom'', which spews action and drama, is based on the "visual language of comics", unlike the romance and war comic-based work that focuses more on the narrative than the graphic details as this work does.&lt;ref name="Carl 2012-07-17"/&gt;
